15g-20g is exactly what I use as well.  I plug it, though, I don't drink it.  (Why doesn't everybody plug it?  There's no downside that I can see, and you lose most of the nasty side effects.)

Are you serious? How much water do you mix in with your pods? I usually use two cups of water (for about 1 1/2 cups worth of grinds) and I can't imagine putting that up there. 


But by god, I'm willing to try...it's getting to the point where I have to drink the shit over the sink because I'll throw up a little with every other gulp ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I've been just soaking my grounds in 100% cranberry juice.


Tastes a LOT nicer than a water soak.

Wow... 1.5 cups of grinds?  What's that in grams?  15g is about two standard tea bags' worth, definitely less than a cup.


Actually though, 2 cups of water isn't much to put "up there".  Enema bags hold a lot more than that, and your colon certainly can.  I just use a syringe 5 times or so (~100mL of liquid), but with more liquid I'd probably get an enema bag like they sell in any drugstore.

Yep, thats the stuff.  


Grapefruit juice is good also.  Any 100% juice of pretty much any kind will help with the taste.

I think the key here is that you grind your pods and measure by weight, esentially evening out the pod powder, if you will.  Those that measure by number/size of pods generally experience more variance.  That, and switching suppliers can make a big difference.

So on a related note to the OP's question, assuming that most varieties of pods are pretty much the same potency by weight, what's the best deal?  By that I mean, what variety of poppies generally gives you the most grams for your buck?  XL, L, M, S?


I notice that some of the prices are quite distorted, which means that some people must actually be buying pods as decoration (go figure!).  Any particular strains that might be sought after by decorators and therefore avoided by us?


[Erowid sez](http://www.erowid.org/plants/poppy/poppy_info2.shtml) 1g-2g weight for an average deseeded "small" pod and 4g+ for the giant ones.  However, the giant always cost well over double the amount of the small (per pod).  So is it best to shoot for the smallest pods?  Answers appreciated, since I need to reorder...

I think the smaller ones are a lot cheaper, but larger ones overall have more potency. I cannot give you a definitive answer......

For small ones, I have no scale so what do you think (offhand) would be a good amount of pods to blend?

Come on now.


Grind pods with blender or coffee grinder (after removal of seeds/knuckle&stem/crown)


Weigh out a dose (12 grams is good start for no tolerance)


Get a glass jar.  Pour ground pod into it.  Add lemon juice and hot(not boiling) water.


Shake and let soak for 20 minutes.


Strain the grounds out with a cloth/piece of shirt/clean rag/sock. Squeeze it good to get all the liquid.


Drink.


Learn how to UTFSE :D

I want to say I don't agree with the lemon juice aspect, in numerous trials I have found that lemon juice either does not increase or actually *reduces* potency.


Also I have discovered lately that a 20 minute hot water soak doesn't get nearly all of the actives.  What I have started doing is a LONG cold water soak on the "spent" pods and then using that water the next time I brew tea (with fresh ones).  This greatly aids potency of the subsequent brew.

I am inclined to agree, but I doubt it really decreases solubility and thus potency. Lemon juice, that is.


As, citrates, base, and sulphate form of morphine all seem to have a similar solubility in water.


Cant speak for the other alkaloids, so I suppose that could effect perceived potency.


I pretty much add lemon juice just to further improve taste.......


The little outline I gave above was pretty generic and I assumed OK for the purposes of the kid whom asked. 


Lately, I've been using a long/cold soak method, although still with lemon juice,  and instead of water, 100% cranberry juice.  


Works great and tastes bearable(up to around 50grams pod powder anyway)

A lot of this has been covered elsewhere but I wanted to make a single thread revolving around the noble aim of getting as high as possible for your poppy $$, share my experiences, and solicit others' ideas.


**Seeds or Pods?**

My experience: either works, subjective effect is indistinguishable, however the potency of seeds is simply too variable.  I stick with pods.


**What Kind?**

As long as it's *Papaver somniferum*, it doesn't seem to matter much.  Larger pods are more expensive gram-for-gram than small ones (probably because they are more sought after by flower arrangers), so I buy small pods, strain irrelevant.


**How to Prepare?**

For seeds: actives are all on the outside, so the best prep method is to shake for a minute or two in hot water and then strain.  Steeping merely causes morphine in solution to soak into the seeds and be lost.


For pods: Grinding into a fine powder is my preferred method, but simply crushing the pods by hand seems to work just as well.  Dosing by weight of ground powder is highly recommended to standardize the experience and lower the risk of accidental OD.  I place the powder in tea filters and steep it in ~90C water (not quite boiling) for 20-30 minutes.  Acidifying the water does not seem to help.  After I do a hot water extraction, I generally leave the powder in cold water for another 8-12 hours and then use that water as a base for the next batch of tea.  This does improve potency a fair amount.


**How to Administer?**

There are three good options: eat the pods, drink the tea, or plug the tea.  Eating the pods is certainly the best way to get all the actives, but I opt for plugging in order to avoid unpleasant GI side effects.  Rachamim mentioned in another thread that basifying the tea might help with bioavailability when plugging.  I tried this today (3g calcium carbonate added to 750mL of solution), but it had no appreciable effect other than a burning sensation when plugged. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


**How to Potentiate?**

Cimetidine (Tagamet) and grapefruit juice are usually mentioned as good potentiators.  They seem to make little difference when plugging, probably because drugs absorbed through the colon are only partially subject to first-pass metabolism in any case.  Even when poppies are consumed orally, the potentiation is not likely to be more than 10% or so.  Worth a try, but don't get your hopes up.


Two substances that do work very well in combination with poppy tea are DXM (dextromethorphan, available OTC in cough remedies, but make sure it's the only active ingredient), and diphenhydramine (available in OTC allergy medications).  I have found that even the "recommended" dose of these substances produces substantial effects in combination with poppy tea.  I'm not sure potentiation is the correct term, though, because these substances are each psychoactive independently and add their own coloration to the experience.  For instance, diphenhydramine makes me very sleepy.  YMMV.


IMO the best "potentiator" of poppy tea is set and setting.  Using the tea when you are relaxed and have no responsibilities or places to go is the best way to ensure a positive experience.


**Tolerance**

Tolerance is an unfortunate fact of life with opiates, and morphine is the original opiate.  I have heard anecdotal reports that using small amounts of DXM daily can reduce opiate tolerance, but I have seen no clinical data on this and in my experience the effect is minor.


Edit: It is possible to get a smokeable product by evaporating pod tea.  See [this thread.](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=351107)

Good thread idea.


Poppy seed tea isn't really worth it IMO. I rather take 5mgs of hydrocodone, or even codeine! 


If you are interested in PST, make sure you buy bulk seeds. They could typically be found at whole sale stores or ethnic stores. McCormick(or other popular brands) are shit and their seeds may be pre-washed.

^^Exactly.  And, as you say, anyone with ANY sort of tolerance with get absolutely nothing out of PST.


EDIT:

I'd like to add something about calculating your dose when making pod tea, or using pods at all.  DO NOT go by number/size of pods!  At best you could be disappointed and at worst you could end up in a life-threatening situation.  ALWAYS grind ALL of your pod material and measure your doses by weight; ALWAYS.

Nice thread man. 


I had a odd question about the caloric intake of poppies. I'll try to explain, bare with me. Does anyone know how much of the calories in poppy seeds you would consume with just washing the seeds? For example, 8.8g of poppy seeds has around 50 calories, so if I'm making tea with 250 or so grams of seed, but only actually eating a few of the seeds that make there way past filtering, am I still consuming a shit load of calories? Anyone have any info on this? I know it's kind of a retarded question, but I'm cutting weight right now, so I'd like some info on it.


Thanks for any help in advance. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

good question.   if you grind up the seeds and boil them you're probably dissolving the sugars and starches in them and getting all the calories. 


Better method would be to soak the seeds in cold water for 24 hours as your extraction.  The opium in PST is just from whatever opium is sitting on the outside of the seed - the seeds themselves dont contain opium.  So boiling isnt necessary.  Cold water also reduces the nausea significantly because there are less waxes and shit released from the seeds.  


This should help with the calories - opium is not a real significant source of energy, and if you just use cold water, you wont be getting any of the seeds' inner nutritional contents.

Try 2-4 minutes with agitation, after 24 hours the seeds will have absorbed much of the water and alkaloids plus released their oils so whatever is left will be an oily goopy mess.


I think even with a mild tolerance you could get something out of potent seed, you might have to wash several pounds at a time though. But if your tolerance is such that 100-200mgs of oral morphine won't touch you then yea forget about it.


If you want to get the maximum amount of alkaloids from pods and the longest lasting effect your best bet is removing their knobs, stems, seeds, and crowns and then grinding the pods into fine powder. Put it in a mug pour some hot water over the powder and stir then let steep for around ten minutes to soften. Then stir it again and quickly chug it down and have a beverage ready in case some powder sticks in your throat but normally none does. 

The only negatives to this are it is by far the worst MOA when it comes to constipation, and it will cause faster tolerance development and has more prolonged WD when compared to tea. 


BTW the crowns and stems are still suitable for making tea, but are not suitable for consumption as they remain too hard even with a hot water soak.

PST sucks... PPT is AMAZING, i used to use around 13-18 grams of PP powder when i made my tea, i'd cut a lemon in half and squeeze one of of the lemon into the mix and the other half i'd throw in.  i'd steep for 15-20 minutes, and there you have a nice cup of morphine tea (along with codeine, thebaine, etc).


i'd rank it up there with heroin, IV oxycodone and IV hydromorphone, PPT is strong stuff and lasts a long time (compared to other opioids) which is why its so great!  a 6-7 hour PPT buzz is MUCH BETTER IMO/IME's than a 2.5-3 hour oxycodone high IV/oral/intranasal, and not quite as euphoric as heroin but lasts 2-3 times as long and is pretty damn euphoric still.

in terms of price how does it compare? i know heroin and oxy are really expensive--not asking for exact numbers, just relative to heroin/oxy iv, how does it compare price-wise?


EOJ you seem to have VERY similar drug preferences to me, so your opionions i respect quite a bit--you have me very intrigued.

PPT is far cheaper than heroin or oxy: you can get 20 jumbo poppy pods (over 120g of ground pod material) for less than $30 with shipping included.  If you've got no tolerance, 20g of pod straw should send you to the land of nod -- so you're talking around $5 a dosage.

hey i had a question about ppt. i only bought them one time, and though i could feel the nod and the morphine, i was always overwhelmingly tired when i drank the tea, i thought it was a side effect of a much larger amount of codeine in them.


i know its impossible to tell the strength of each batch, but this DOES vary right? i wouldnt buy them again if i knew i was for sure going to get an expensive sleep aid.

really depends on how much you buy, the more you buy the lower the price, its more expensive than H is (in my area at least) and cheaper than using oxy/hydro.


a good dose of PPT will cost you anywhere from $5-$13   i would estimate.

Might be a stupid question, but as I have no experience with things like this, I'm very curious.


I unfortunately seem to have a rather strong gag reflex.  If I were to make poppy pod tea or poppy seed tea, after the tea is finished steeping, would I be able to remove the seed/pod matter and boil it down to a very minuscule amount of liquid, or even down to just a powder so I could cap it and take it like that?

Yea, but its hard because you can't let it boil too hard without degrading what little morphine is in it. I'd say taste it first, pod tea especially is not too bad, a little cordial or sugar and its easy to chug.


If you don't have a problem with pills you could powder the pods and then pack the powder into gelcaps, expect to have to take about 20-30 horsepills though.

You can also mix pod powder into yogurt and eat it fast.

I have noticed chewing on half a dried poppy pod and swallowing the juice gives a nice buzz and gives you something to do with your mouth.

I did consider the powdered pods method, but I figured it would be waaay too many caps to take, though.  I'll definitely be trying the tea, though.  Now, when you say "boil too hard," do you mean at too hot a temperature, or for too long?


Even though it probably tastes worse, I'll probably try just chewing a bit of a pod, too.

Tried pod tea for the first time a few days ago, I liked it!  Me and a friend used approx. 50 mini sized pods (size of a golf ball or smaller) ground in a coffee maker.  Steeped for 30 - 35 minutes, and strained out the powdered pod, set it aside for a second wash after the first had been consumed.  I had the whole second wash to myself, although significantly weaker, as evidenced by the color of the tea, pretty sure it made a difference though.


It was an enjoyable buzz, don't think I drank enough, could have doubled it I think... the sedation was definitely there pretty strong (no nod or anything) but not the euphoria.  I felt very relaxed, but it wasn't quite that "ahhhh that's great" vibe I get when on H or painkillers.  Then again, it's NOT H or painkillers, and I can't order them off eBay. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Very worth while still IMO, I'll definitely be doing it again!


Great thread idea, btw.

You can get as strong an effect as you want from pods, it's just dose-dependent.  It's morphine, after all...

**Poppy Pod grounds worth consuming?**


When preparing poppy pod tea, should one make an effort to get the spent grounds down?  The tea is manageable, but lordy the spent ground is an instant gag reflex almost.  Is the effort worth it?

Logically it would make sense to eat them. But I have always been too "lazy" to.


If it was your last batch, you might as well eat them.

This process was told to me by a friend who used to deal with PPT very regularly and refined by me. I've done it a couple times and seems to have good results. 


Morphine, as an alkaloid, is not water soluble!


Codeine is slightly water-soluble, -- this is why poppy tea works. You're essentially drinking a lot of codeine water, but getting very few of the other alkaloids, and most importantly, very little morphine. This not fucking cool. Fortunately, the remedy is simple.


In Southeast Asia, the process of turning opium into heroin start with a basic morphine extraction which is done using lime (calcium oxide), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), or limestone (calcium carbonate). For profitability reasons, groups usually use cheap chemical fertilizers containing these chemicals, but of course you don't want to go dumping fertilizer into your tea. 


But, where do we get those chemicals? Well, they're all forms of calcium. In fact, calcium carbonate is the main component of many calcium supplements -- look for it on the label/description. Bottom line? Powder up calcium carbonate supplements, add them to your very lightly boiling tea, stir, and then filter off the poppy gunk for huge win. This step will convert the water-insoluble morphine into water-soluble calcium morphenate, meaning your plain old codeine tea turns into supercharged morphine and codeine tea. Keep the tea, throw away the plant matter, and enjoy. All for not too much more than your normal tea process.


Even more effective than calcium carbonate is calcium hydroxide. It can be toxic at very high doses, but is commonly used in the food industry and is safe in the very small amount we need. You can find this very cheaply online with a simple search, and if you're going through the effort of finding and buying pods, you should go through the easy step of buying a cheap, legal product to further potentiate the tea.


If you are just making it for yourself or a couple buddies you should just stop here and be satisfied.


But for those who are bored with PPT, feel like making some cool stuff, and want to go a step further, there is yet another cheap, readily available ingredient you can add, along with a couple steps, that can be used to actually extract raw morphine. I'm going to withhold exactly what it is so as to not give step by step instructions on how to extract and purify morphine, and please don't go try and test random chemicals either. Even if you know what you are doing, it's a certain chemical and you're probably not going to just randomly get it right. You have to know what it is. It's out there, by name, with some other instructions on a certain poppy site describing the manufacture of my favorite drug ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


Take the calcium morphenate solution, filter the poppy mess as normal and then add this ingredient. The mixture is stirred over low heat to dissolve the recent addition completely. It is then taken off the heat, and as it sits and cools, over the next 1-2 hours chunks of morphine base will precipitate out (fall out)of the solution and settle to the bottom. The water is then siphoned off (solution is toxic now) and then filtered to make sure all the water is out. The remaining solids are scraped out of the both filter and the pan, collected, and set in the sun to dry. 


The resulting course, coffee-colored, powder is crude morphine base, ranges between 50-75% purity, and can be safely consumed. This can be easily refined further (converted to morphine hydrochloride) to increase purity, and if you really wanted to, you could do another simple step or two after extracting and actually cook up some heroin. Converting the morphine base to Hcl isn't required before this, but doing so will increase purity. The next step would produce ~70% pure heroin base which then could be converted to the Hcl.


I decided that it was best not to include either the ingredients needed for the extraction or the process required to synthesize heroin from the extraction to try to keep this within the rules. I figure that while the rules don't allow synthesis discussion, the process I outlined above involves changing the makeup of the tea so the morphine alkaloids become water soluble, potentiating the tea greatly. This is written for making enough for just one sitting and not some sort of mass production, which is another reason for leaving out the exact details on extraction. 


Everything needed are legal products (groups that make something as proliferant as heroin have the means to make it in the first place, right?) and can be bought both online and in stores, but I don't know exactly how keen mods would be with me explaining the exact details of morphine extraction and/or heroin synthesis in your kitchen. Its a simple process, but probably illegal (the end product is for sure) and there still is room for error that can cause damage or death to 13 year old girls who fuck it up and and fail. 


For the home user, being able to drink the morphine tea will be fine and a nice change to the plain old tea. It only takes maybe a few minutes more than usual to crumble the calclium carbonate/calcium hydroxide, add it to the poppy gook water over low heat, stir it long enough to make sure you get everything, then strain as normal and drink.


I would like people to try to refine this process further to extract the other alkaloids, as I'm not sure if they are getting extracted either. There are about 35 of them, including thebaine, which is an essential component in the manufacture of oxycodone, oxymorphone, and buprenorphine.  This  makes it very interesting and sought-after to someone wanting to get the most they can out of the poppy.

Unfortunately almost all posts involving sources aren't allowed. It's not because what you're asking is illegal, poppy pods are legal. It's because what may be legal in one country might not be legal in another and its just easier to ban almost all source discussion. I think sources involving harm reduction tools are allowed though, where to buy filters, new syringes, and the like.

My dog's friend's owner that has a monkey and that monkey's cusin SWIM, thinks that dried pods are only about 1% in morphine content and that bigger pods make much much much more of a difference because of the weight of a  small dried turkish pod is about 2-3grams and giganteums are about 10 to 15grams per pod and this monkey's Cusin SWIM notices a taking one 15gram giganteum pods is = to the same in effect as the weight of 15 grams of several turkish pods.

Anything on that?

poppy seeds are used for cooking and can be bought at all supermarkets. The best place to get them is at a whole sale store, if there is not a wholesale store around make sure to get them at a natural food store(whole sale and organic shit are not as washed so more opium on the outside of the seeds).

I have a relatively interesting theory.


Say you have a fair amount of dried poppy pods.  You take however many you usually use to make tea, grind it up finely in a coffee grinder, then use that in lieu of coffee in a coffee maker.  This would work, wouldn't it?

I wonder what an espresso machine (i.e. pressurized steam) would do? more/less potent, or no difference?

You're not from Eastern Europe, are you?  Google "Kompot + heroin" for further details.


To save you some keystrokes: if you have enough poppy pods and a few other ingredients you can indeed make heroin.  Indeed, most morphine used in pharms today is extracted by tea-brewing rather than scraping opium latex.

You guys who saying poppy seed tea is weak, have just been getting bad seeds. You can get whatever amount of morphine you want from.


Most of what Jykke says is true. It really isn't worth it extracting the morphine from pods to take. Making tea is just way easier. It always blew my mind that poor farmers take time to extract opium. It is VERY labor intensive. YOu could just take all the pods put them in a pot, and extract it with water.


Where Jykke said morphine is not water soluable, he is wrong. How do you think you shoot up morphine pills with just wate.r

Don`t most IV users always prepare their shots by using citric acid,not just water alone?


Also,back on topic,what is the difference with the different types of poppy? For instance,Turkish white,Gigantium,Dutch maxi ect ect,i know there is size difference and colour,but is there a difference in alkaloidal content of the different varieties?

Morphine is water soluble. Untreated morphine alkaloids are not. You can confirm this by looking up the process that groups follow for heroin manufacture. Morphine pills contain morphine hcl, not raw morphine. For use in medicinal pain killers, the morphine alkaloids has been converted, purified, and refined into the hcl salt form, which is water soluble.


Specifically, this information quoted from a source that has the information on the mass manufacturing of heroin in the SE Asia region: 


> Slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), or more often a readily available chemical fertilizer with a high content of lime, is added to the solution. The lime converts the water insoluble morphine into the water soluble calcium morphenate. The other opium alkaloids do not react with the lime to form soluble calcium salts. Codeine is slightly water soluble and gets carried over with the calcium morphenate in the liquid. For the most part, the other alkaloids become part of the residual sediment 'sludge' that comes to rest on the bottom of the oil drum.

I can't say where I have quoted this from as it, obviously, contains the entire opium->heroin synthesis. The process is all over the internet though, not a single obscure location, and it's easily found.

Same as codiene then.Thanks for the reply to the question,i have gained a bit more knowledge.


So Diamorphine is not water soluble? Why do they add citric acid? Is it to help with removal of adulterants?


Lots of questions i know,but i`m here to learn.

I'm guessing you're thinking about "diacetylmorphine," which is the chemical name of heroin, not "diamorphine."


There are a couple different types of heroin.


Heroin #4 is made for injecting, and is most common in the USA.

Heroin #3 is made for smoking, and is common to Europe.


Users that get Heroin #3 have to add citric acid to prepare the substance in order to IV because heroin #3 is heroin base mixed with caffeine so it requires an acid in order to become water soluble. 


Kind of like if you want to inject cocaine base, which is known as crack. you have to add an acid. I've injected it a couple times, and before I could IV it I added some lemon juice to it would dissolve in water.

Just say where you quoted it from. The DEA website.


Here is how it works by your own admission: You soak the pods in water and strain. Then you ahve that water. Guess what is that water. Morphine! 


Then you add the slaked lime to form whatever morphine calium carbonate forms, that drops most of opiate alkoloids out of the solution. You filter, add a 'mystery ingrediant' to raise the PH to 9.2, then the morphine base precipiates out.


Now, if the morphine didn't get into the water in the first place, where did it come from later? More importantly, why am I coppin a morphine buzz when I drink poppy tea?

**Mr Poppy**


A friend uses a 4-cup Mr. Coffee to make both poppy tea and kratom tea.  The trick is to run the liquid  (water + little lemon juice)through the machine 3 times.  


Adding a bag or 2 of Yogi Tea helps kill the taste.

This method works, although not quite as well as just putting it in a big bottle and shaking for a while. make sure you run it through a few times, I've always done it at least 3 times. After that, it seems to not make much of a difference.

I've heard that the higher temperature of a drip coffee maker does damage to some alkaloids in the pods, stems, etc. though my first time trying this, I did make it through our 12 cup mr. coffee and I ran it through 3 times with coffee as well. I was fucking nodding like crazy. 5 3 inch pods had me feeling better than heroin (I don't IV anything so I can't compare to that).

Yes, the coffee maker method works. It's a quick and easy (lazy) way to make pod tea IMO. Other methods, such as making tea on the stove and motoring the temperature, raising the pH, etc. may be more effective at extracting morphine though.

**Merged: Ultimate poppy pod tea thread (getting the most out of your pods)**


OK.Today, im sitting at home dope sick, and some of us know how that feels.

I had 2 poppy pods sitting around, and due to prior advice, i decided to eat them instead of making tea.let me tell you, eating those bastards is like eating a crunchy,opium flavored cardboard.i wouldnt reccomend it to those with weak stomachs.now, usually, i make a tea out of 3 giant pods(those two i had were giants) to get a decent buzz.now from what i hear, eating the pods is far more effecttive at getting your moneys worth out of your poppy pods.ive even heard that you have to use half as much pod material to obtain the same high.is anyone experienced in this department??has any one made tea AND eaten the pods,and if so, is it true that you need less pod material if you eat them?

any advice is very appreciated-

I assume eating the pods would get you the most bang for your buck seeing as how absolutely zero material is wasted.  I have no experience with the matter, however.

I've been using pod tea and eating the raw grounds for many, many years. Tea comes on faster and hits you harder, the raw grounds on the other hand (make sure you grind them up in a coffee grinder, as fine as possible before eating, and actually don't eat them, but mix them in with the fruit juice of your choice and gulp em down...kinda has the consistency of metamucil powder mixed in juice) takes a bit longer to start working, but they will hold the WD's off for much, much longer, and the feel is a bit like methadone or bupe (but less damaging to your bank account), not much of a high, but you feel well for a lot longer, sometimes up to 24 hours depending on dose and stomach contents. I am currently coming off of a 1 year long IV heroin binge (not every single day, but almost..., spent about 45,000$ on  Baltimore/DC white and brown powder "raw" dope during that hellride of a time, I went back to pods to do a slow taper with raw grounds (and occasional tea, if I really feel the need to catch a buzz) and it has been a godsend. Sorry to digress there, anywhoo...., the grinds are more economical, but expect it to be a bit like m-done, or better yet bupe.....You feel the satiation of your receptors being filled with an exo-opiate, but you wont get too high. I dont know about other folks here, but for me, after my descent into IV heroin-hell, just feeling well and not high is like a high in and of itself. PM me if anyone has questions about pp-tea (except sources, I cant help you with that).

^ seconded.


i would have a pouch with them already ground up, and either pour the grinds into a *small* glass of grapefruit juice then chug, and rinse and chug again. or after getting use to the grind consistency, just pour them directly into my mouth, take a swig and repeat.


it seemed like such a waste throwing the pod material away...

I think I know what you are looking for here. I wanted to post a 'MOA : Raw Poppy Pods Vs. Tea/rectal/other' deal...


First time I was using poppy pods, when I thought there was some huge process involved, I ground them up thinking there'd be little/no effect and washed them down with cold water. The result was a very physical high (presumably best case scenario for a dopesick individual), little (positive) mental buzz and a fair bit of nausea. 


Given that I'd expected very little from the raw pods, I was shocked at how floored (opiate tolerance free individual) I was. I felt unpleasantly sedated after about 20 grams of ground pods in water. I looked fucking awful in the mirror and simply put - it wasn't much fun.


Poppy tea - that's a different story, even when I've eaten the grounds.


I've steeped ground pod material in near-boiling water, tried microwaving near-boiling water + pods for twenty minutes then steeping until cool enough to drink and in both cases have eaten/left the grounds. Pod tea, with or without eating the grounds is somewhat enjoyable but is about 10 times more addictive that it deserves to be. It leaves me looking somewhat sinister the following day - pupils pinpoint at all times, so it's a bit of a fucker.


Finally, I've cracked apart raw pods and chewed + swallowed them up. Terrible nausea, high was even more physical than ground pods in cold water but again - for dopesickness probably ideal. No pleasure from either of the cold water experiences.

pods make you constipated enough WITHOUT eating the grounds. Eating the grounds is litterally like shitting a football with stickers on it. Or maybe a pineapple. You really can feel the little peice of dried plant scrap agaisnt you as you go to the bathroom.

Id really like to know the results of your trial, so if you would, keep us updated. 

BTW the pods that i ate helped my detox symptoms GREATLY.My nose stopped running, the dysphoria went away(mostly), and i felt much better in general.

My tolerance is so high nowadays that i have to make a 5 pod tea thats brewed for 10 or so hours with an acid(mostly use citric) to get high, so 1.5 pods,and a bit of crushed pod matrial(probably .5 pods) that i put back in the bag i stored pods in didnt give me a buzz, i barely felt it, but it was enough to ward off w/d. i did go out and pick up a .33 gram

chunk of black "shard"(dried tar) today, so i feel great now.thanks for the advice guys-

Apologies for confusion!


I can't say how many you should eat. I've tried the small/medium and giganteum sized pods and the results were so different (comparing equals weights, not number of pods) that I have no idea how to estimate the opiod content of pods anymore. 


I made a tea with 3 giganteum pods tonight but I'd already had 9 or 10 beers so effects are harder to judge. If anything, the grounds are easier to swallow when you're edging towards the drunk side - taste doesn't seem to be bothering me tonight.


Which leads me to

Totally disagree. If anything, I'd suggest that the pods are a half-decent source of fibre that reduces the constipation problem. I don't get how you could 'feel' ground (POWDER) pod material as it leaves your ass?


edit:


there are the grounds at the beginning of the end of the pot, the grounds at the middle of the end and the grounds at the end. The grounds at the end...n o t  p l e a s a n t.


All the more reason for a fresh brew, here we go...

logic tells me that eating the whole thing (grounds) brings *all* of the drug in your body.

making tea is obviously prone to loosing some product.


Just swallow the grounds, or make tea, drink and then swallow the remains.


// i also heard that plugging the whole pods is a rather good and efficient way of taking them. Just pray to god that they constipate you properly

I switched from oxy to pods around 3 or 4 months ago due to cost. Turns out that I actually enjoy pods more. Anyways, with the first few batches I made tea. It worked. Then, one day when I was low on supply, I ground up a few pods, mixed the powder with a little water...just enough to make it not too thick so I could chug it, and drank it. I can't describe how foul this is. The taste is something I will NEVER forget. You must have a very strong stomach and good control over your "puke" reflex for lack of a better word. If you can get it down, it's MUCH better than tea. It takes half the amount of pods for the same high, and the high lasts longer. I only take pods this way now...tea is just too wasteful.

i used to make tea, but not only is it much faster and easier, but i agree you get more bang for your buck just eating the pods. i just grind the pods into a fine powder, stir it in water and throw it back. chase it with some fruit or a smoothie. making tea doesnt reduce the nasty taste enough for me to go thru all that hassle.

In theory you are correct, but in reality you are not.


Making tea is more efficient because the opiate alkaloids are concentrated into a smaller solution. When the tea is drunk, it is absorbed much more easily and quite quickly in the intestines.


On the other hand, raw material is going to absorb unevenly in the intestines. A smaller amount of opiate alkaloids will be absorbed at a slower rate.


This is why Tea is the preferred method of ingestion.

like the other guy said, tea is good if you want it to hit quicker, but then by the time youre done making the tea you couldve been feeling the effects from just eating the grinds :D and i disagree that a smaller amount of alkaloids are absorbed. infact i think just eating the grinds is stronger, and it lasts longer. to each his own tho.

Man I'm still mixed up.


Some of you say ground pods hits harder and lasts longer, and is more efficient so you need less pods.


Others say tea hits harder, but doesn't last as long, and is more efficient so that you need less pods.


Basically we've got answers all over the spectrum (drinking tea vs eating pods)


I love tea... and have been curious to choke down some ground pods. Guess I'll just have to try it and see which group I fall into.

Eating pod powder is definitely more efficient, but gentler come-up (and slower). Usually, I'll eat half my powder and make tea with the other half: the best of both worlds! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Pod tea will hit harder and faster, but it won't last as long, and you will not get 100% of the alkaloids. The tea gives you higher peak plasma concentrations.


The grounds take longer to kick in, and the peak won't be as strong, but the main advantage to eating the grounds is that you are consuming 100% of the alkaloids. 


Rave23's idea of making tea, then eating the grounds isn't a bad one.. Or you could just make tea and do multiple washes on the ground until the water almost comes out clear. That way you can get MOST of the alkaloids out without having to eat the grounds.


**I'm going to unapprove some posts and merge this with the ultimate poppy pod thread since this is a common question and we've covered the answer nicely.**

I dunno, those pods are gross enough when they're freshly ground. Anyone who could eat them after they've been steeping in hot water for 20 minutes is made of stronger stuff than me. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


And you should always steep at least 2-3 times. One steeping won't get anywhere near all the goods out of the grounds.

**Merged: Ultimate poppy pod tea thread (getting the most out of your pods)**


Hello all.  I've been visiting Bluelight for a while, but have always found the answers I needed using the search engine, until now.


1)  I was wondering if anyone has used a filterless coffee maker to make their P. Somniferum tea.  Do you think the filterless coffee makers work just as well as regular ones?  (in terms of activating all of the goodies in the pods, that is)


2)  I was planning on adding calcium carbonate to my tea in order to maximize the amount of morphine released in it.  Should i just put the calcium carbonate (crushed up dietary supplements) in with the water in the coffee maker?


3)  Also, I need a good way to crush the dried pods.  I don't have a coffee grinder (can't afford one right now, poor college kid).  Whats the next best way to grind them into a fine powder?  I also don't have a blender. 


I've heard of adding lime, lemon, and grapefruit juice to the tea after it's been made.  The grapefruit would potentiate the opiates obviously, but is the lime used for the calcium content?  I'm guessing that lemon (and honey) are jsut added for flavor.


If anyone has any recipes using **calcium carbonate**, and/or limes or grapefruit juice, feel free to share.  My main question is if a filterless coffee maker will be just as good as a coffee maker with a filter.  I will take recipes/suggestions that do not require a coffee maker, but I really want to use my coffee maker - less mess and less stress.


Thanks all.

1. What's a filterless coffee maker? I use a French Press, and it works great. I would say you definitely need to use water that is just short of boiling. A regular Mr. Coffee-type drip coffeemaker will simply not get the water nearly as hot as you need it. French Press FTW.


2. I keep meaning to try this, since jyKKe mentioned it a couple weeks ago. We really need some formal experiments to see if the calcified tea is stronger. Someone start a thread.

In answer to your question, I would say don't put it in the water reservoir if the water is going to be pumped, dripped, etc. You'll just fuck up your machine. Add the CC to the finished tea. (But you shouldn't be using that machine anyway, for reasons described above.)


3. You really need a coffee grinder, man. That should be your #1 priority in Pod tea equipment; you really need to get that shit down to a powder to get all the goods out. I go thru a coffee grinder every 3-4 months. Get a $20 one from Starbucks or wherever. There really is no acceptable substitute, as you will waste an egregious amount of dope if you don't powderize your pods.

i just got pods last week and have been making tea for the past 3 days. one cup a nite for sleeping and aiding in slowing my fent from 100mcg patch down to at least 25mcg..


anyways, i tried the boiling water method and straining, and while i could drink most of it, the nasty stuff at the bottom was just too much for me..


the past 2 nites, i used my coffee maker.. i would put the tea thru 3 times and it gets pleanty hot enuff.. so much so i put it in the fridge with lemon juice to cool for a bit.

then i take a strainer and put the grounds from the coffee filter and mash it down over a large 2 qt pot. that gets a lot more 'tea' out..


all in all, it works well.... when i lay down while i drink and watch tv, it just a very nice relaxing feeling... and it has cut my WD from the fent down to nothing... 


on a side note to this, im not doing this to quit opiates, just doing this till my next doc. appt at the end of the month so i can get on a lower dosage of fent. 100mcg makes me WAAAAY to tired throughout the 72 hrs.. i sleep like 10hrs a nite.. too much when you have to work, and want a life...

The coffee maker I have is "filterless" - you just put whatever amoutn of coffee grounds into this area with a screened tool.  I guess the thing with the screen is the filter, but you don't need to buy actual coffee filters for it, so I guess its marketed as filterless.


So that kind of coffee maker (it drips and makes one cup in about 5 minutes), isn't the best for getting all of the alkaloids from the poppies?


Man I wish I had some dough so I could get a french press and a coffee grinder.


I may just end up buying a cheap coffee grinder and just boil water over the stove to make the tea.  Should I use lemon juice?  Doesn't lime have more calcium, and wouldn't lime juice help more morphine get into the tea (at least in theory)?

Does a coffee grinder, stove top method, and some calcium carbonate and/or lime juice sound like a good bet?


I am experienced with opiates - hyrdrocodone's my favorite, with oxy coming in a close second place.  I also like morphine, fentanyl, dilaudid, and have done the weaker stuff like codiene, tramadol, and darvocet.

I must say, after doing my research, I've never been so excited about an opiate as I am about poppy tea!  I can't wait for my giants to get in hopefully by Friday so I can cook em up and feel the effects of the h i g h.


If anyone has ever made PPT with the type of coffee maker I have, please let me know how it went.  It's actually a fairly expensive coffee maker, I'm just afraid that it won't soak the grounds long enough to get the most out of them.


Other than that, any tips on a good stove top experience or on calcium carbonate, or other calciumy (def. not a word)  things used to make better PPT, would be much appreciated.

What exactly do you mean by putting the tea thru 3 times?  Like making 3 cups with the same ground gunk, or putting the liquid itself through the coffee filter 3 times over?

On second thought, I may just make the tea, and try to get it down without sifting out the leftover grounds.  If I mixed it to taste decent...well is this even worth trying or will I puke instantly?

I maybe giving this too much thought b/c of the excited anticipation.  Any suggestion and help will be valued much, though.

yeah...put the same liquid through over and over...each time it'll get a little more concentrated. but you may need to heat it up in between to be sure its hot enough. anybody know if using the microwave will alter anything chemically? i got no clue

**Merged: Ultimate poppy pod tea thread (getting the most out of your pods)**


I have 2 questions about Poppy Pods ....


1. - Is it safer/better to go ahead and make pod tea using hot but not quite boiling water, then strain the powder to eliminate the excess plant material? Lately Ive just been grinding the pods as finely as I can get them then adding the powder to coffee/orange juice/whatever and drinking them. The high using this method seems to last longer but it also seems to cause some stomach problems, nausea, indigestion, severe constipation,etc. I don't notice these symptoms, or they are much less severe when I make tea and don't consume the grounds.


2. - Can you just use hot water from a sink to "steep" the poppy grounds? I find myself in situations at times where I don't have access to a blender or a stove and pot/pan, etc. I was wondering if I could just crush the pods in an envelope, then use the hottest tap water I can get and let the grounds sit in a bowl for a while and finally strain with an old tshirt or whatever I can find. "Field Work" so to speak ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

1: If you can stomach the powder and the 'tea' at the same time, go for it.   Aside from the little bit of indigestion your not going to hurt yourself..... 

   I think you'll find after a certain point you will need too much ground pod than you can get down......then you will have to strain ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


2: Yep, hot tap water is plenty warm enough.  Getting your pod ground to a fine powder will work better than just crushing, but if you soak longer you'll get just as much out of it.

i actually found a much better way last nite...


boil the water, grind the pods as per the recipie...


all i did diff this time was cut up the cloth pad that fits over a heating pad (had 1 extra). its like a thick cotton tshirt... i was able to put the entire cut 1/2 pad in a spaghetti strainer and pour the 'sawdust' mixture in it... it went thru fast. then i took the pad and grabed all four corners a twisted it till no extra 'juice' went thru...


worked like a charm...


i can't get down the grounds at all... i tried and puked so this method seems to be the best for me..

1. Either way works. Making tea with hot water is a good idea so the alkaloids hit you harder/faster. Eating the grounds works too, and this way you don't waste any of the alkaloids, but it takes longer for the alkaloids to hit you and you won't have as strong of a peak since they won't hit you all at once. Making tea AND consuming the leftover grounds gives you the best of both worlds. If you do multiple "washes" when making tea until the solution comes out almost clear then you can discard the grounds and not worry about wasting much.


2) That works. If you can't grind the pod material to a fine powder with a grinder or a blender, then you should let the "grounds" steep for several hours.


**I'm merging this with the ultimate poppy pod thread.**

Yeah, the pods aren't in contact with the water very long either. You nneed to steep them for at least 20 minutes each time (2-3 times).

A good grinder is definitely more important than a french press. Use a clean cotton sock or something to make the tea after you've powderized the pods.


With that machine you're just wasting them. Would be better to eat the pwder.

Cutting corners will drastically reduce the potency of your tea. You can make tea this way, but I would bet it might be half as potent (or less) than if you had made it properly.


**ULTRA POTENCY POPPY TEA BREWING**


This is a tried and true method that has given me the strongest tea I've had. It is also very simple.


You will need:


1 Blender (for grinding pods)

1 Pot (for boiling water)

1 Glass (I use a pint glass)

1 Filter of your choice (I use a sock)


1. Grind pods to powder in a blender. Note that there is a difference between "ground" and "powder". The bigger the pieces of pods, the harder it is to extract from them. Just let the pods grind for a few minutes to do the trick.


2. While the pods are grinding, bring your water to a boil. For 5 HUGE pods, I use about 12oz of water. This may be more water than is necessary, but I'd rather use more than enough than less.


3. Leave your pod powder in the blender, which will also have a good coating of pod all around the inside. Take your water off the boil and pour it into the blender, swirling it around to get all the pod from the sides. I find the temperature of water taken just off the boil to be perfect.


4. Let the pod / water mixture sit until it is cool. I stir it occasionally just to encourage the process.


5. Place your filter over the glass. I use a sock, so I just wrap the top of the sock around the glass and let it hang inside, like a garbage bag in a garbage can. After the tea has emptied into the glass, wring the filter out. A signficant amount of VERY dark tea will come out of the grounds.


6. Drink and be merry. If drinking the tea is hard for you (as it is for me), I recommend pinching your nose and guzzling it as fast as possible. Actually, this is the only way I can drink a full glass quickly without gagging over the bitter taste.


7. (optional) Doing a second wash will yield a light colored tea with a faint bitter taste. It is definately worth the time, but don't expect anything near the power of the first wash.


**- - - - - - -**


I've made tea many times, many different ways, and this gives me the best results by far. Many others swear by this method as well. I used to make tea by simply crumbling the pods up into small pieces and letting them steep in hot water, and this method is easily twice as potent. You can tell because the liquid is much darker and much more bitter. It is my honest opinion that **making tea any other way will only reduce the quality of the tea.**


As for adding things into the tea to help extract alkaloids, I haven't messed around with that so I don't know. Also, I pinch my nose and chug the tea every time, so there is no reason to add anything in for flavor. I don't give a damn about the flavor, because to me it is always nasty and I try to taste it as little as possible anyway!

**spaceyourbass** Just beware if you drink tea more than one day a week (give or take, im sure your results will be different than mine) you will start building a tolerance at a decent rate. I'm sure you know all about tolerance, hehe. Just saying, the economical advantage of pods fades in time like all opiates. It certainly has for me. (which is not to say I don't still partake in a good cup ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^Thanks for the info my man.  Hopefully PPT and PPP will help me start cutting back on opiates alltogether.  Getting away from pills is definately a step in the right direction for me.  Then maybe I'll just buy some pods once a month at the most for recreation...I'm hopin and wishin I guess.  I have a good feeling about this idea though, a good feeling.


I can't wait to have a good feelin when I wash down some of this putty I'm makin, that's for sure.

Hey man I'm really glad to hear that's the direction you're going for, and I wish best of luck to ya. If there is any opiate that is easy to manage, I would say it's poppy pod tea. The effects wear off so gradually, it's not the same as an oxy dose that wears off quickly where all of a sudden you're sober and wanting more. For me, I drink tea in the evening, and the last lingering effects fade sometime the next day... a very mellow transition from high to sober.


I've been chipping once or twice a week for months and managing it has been a snap. No real craving, no physical dependence. Once a month (if you stick to that) will definately leave you in the clear. *knocks on wood*

I ordered some tea, im not giving any sources, but had great effect in the past, similar to oxy or hydros with enough pods and lasts longer and even a couple of times hit the nod.  the recent batch i bought is huge pods, and the guy claims they are untreated and organic, but its been 2 days and i broke out in a rash and felt insanely sick,,, like way way sick.  has any one else had problems like this, i feel like not some natural opiate like morphine codiene or theabaine is in my system but some nasty shit like pesticides or something.  help please has this happoned to any of you, not to mention i feel completely brain dead. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

To those of you who plug the tea...


How much liquid are we talking about?  You can't boil it down for the sake of the alkaloids, so I'm wondering how this works.  How long would dosing take?  If we're talking about turkey basters full of liquid, that would seem to take a very long time to absorb.

OK, 1st post... So for a 175lb male, takes roughly 30mg of Oxy to get a mellow buzz, nothing real strong. Been fairly careful but maybe overindulging for the last month. What would be a decent 1st dose of pods? On-line route and roughly medium sized pods. 3 or 4?  

Thanks!

hey the best way to get most outta your pods is use coffee grinder, i would go with 6 if you have some opiate tolerance.  when i get the best effects i drink first thing on empty stomach ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  good luck man, i have even hit the nod on this stuff before!

Okay so today i decided to get come cheap gin, me not being much of a drinker, and am going to wait about a week to get the stuff disolved in the gin i bought.  i was going to get everclear but they do not sell it where i live so i got 80 proof gin,which may take a while for the powdered pods to disolve in the booze.  im waiting a week on this, to see how well it disolves, then going to try takin a shot or making putty.  i have searched on this method and NO ONE seems to have heard of it i googled it and did poppies.org.  thier way of making puddy is making tea and putting it in oven or on stove or such.  i think this would work better,mainly cuz you dont waste any of the plant material.  i just ground up like 8 pods (large) and going to see if it will disolve in the booze.   i have done this before with pot.  i put an eight in high proof vodka and waited for it to disolve which took a week shook it up occaisionally and took a couple shots and did feel blazed. and drunk.  thats what im hoping will happon with my poppies.

Reading this thread, I realised I'd completely quit pods for 250x kratom extract last  summer.  On an impulse, I ordered 15 med-sized Turkish pods.  Made a test-brew from three to very mild effects: two hours later, added six ground pods to the pot and brewed another two rounds...


Was still unimpressed, so brewed up the remaining six, drank it down: 


And promptly vomited up the contents of my stomach.  


I'm feeling MORE THAN A LITTLE annoyed about this...knew I should have ordered half a kilo.  That said, I think it was 'too much, too fast.'  I have a high kratom tolerance (monstrous, really), but haven't done any opiates since last summer, and the last batch was full of calcium to extract more M.  As it is. I can still feel building effects, but I only kept the last three cups down for half an hour or so, and must have lost a lot of alkaloids.  


Have one re-wash pot for later in the day, but it's almost clear in the French press, and there's NO WAY my weak stomach could keep the grounds down.   


Of course, all of the above is lies and fiction, in the hope the cool kids will talk to me....

^ Man I dunno anything that will help the nausea aside from lying down, and maybe eating a piece of bread or something to soak up the liquid.


Last week I was guzzling tea a little too fast, and I puked a bunch of it into the cup I had just drank out of. My stomach was empty at the time, so it was all tea and stomach gunk in the cup... bottoms up!

Eeyew...


Think the batch I spewed - possibly because of added calcium? - must have been pretty potent.  A few top-up cups, havin washed the 'dog', and I'm feeling a nice little glow.  I don't use other opiates these days (in the UK, there's not much choice, just Afghan H, Tramadol, methadone/bupe, codeine/DHC.  NO oxy or hydro at all), and so have only natural tolerance, which make pods a very 'cheap date' indeed.  


I just wish I had a bit more to smoke - and something better than 2 heads of London standard pseudo-skunk.  If I wasn't so broke, I'd take the learjet to the 'dam and load up on Jack Herer.


Ironically, I think we'll soon be in a situation where pods are legally available (here at least), and kratom gets banned.  Wish I'd known about pods when 'shrooms were still semi-legal here: I suspect tea would be perfect on the comedown.  Has anyone tried this?  Or mixing it with X?

How many grams should a 220lb person with a mild tolerance (nothing from hydro's, 20mg oxycodone gives nice buzz w/nodd if relaxing) consume to get a decent change?  Kinda woried about the whole "accidental OD" thing....

I'd say it's very unlikely to find pods strong enough to OD on with only a few pods... I hope I never have to eat those words, but I've gone through hundreds and hundreds of different pods and none have been that strong.


Anyway, just start by sampling a few pods and see what it does. I had some jumbos once, made tea with six of them, and I was sick as a dog for 48 hours. Shaking and puking, terrible headache. Because of that I'd never recommend a first timer go above three large pods.


It's really something you have to get a feel for... it's not so easy as asking "How much oxy for a first timer?" Because your pods might be half as strong as mine, or five times stronger... just start low

jus doing a recap on the puddy i made...!!!  damn this shit is pleasant as fuck!!!  my method was (since i had no access to everclear illegal in the state im in.)  i got some gin, ground up like 9 pods into a good decent powder and put the stuff into the gin until the gin turned into a dark brown color.  took about 4 daysor longer,shook occasionally.  when i was done, emptyed the gin first into pot, but then after a while would be easier to just stick in oven with pyrex dish on low temp. (lowest temp) and took a long time 7-8-9 hours or so for it to finish.  took outta oven and stirred ocassionaly.  when it was done i was left with a browish goo substace and even noticed like sparkly crystals in it  (possible morphine or somethin i dunno but very small sparkly things were in the goo)  tryed doing some knife hits, but very harsh tasting and didnt get me very high at all,but could def feel something.  i decided to just eat the puddy,  2 hours later i was flyin high, the only downside i would say of poppy pod putty, is it keeps you awake thanks to theabaine. but i have  a really pleasent feeling right now even better than with poppy tea and saves the trouble of having to gulp down all that stuff.  and i figure none of the plant material was wasted as it all disolved into the alcohol.  this method f-ing rocks... umm im passin out now nite everyone.

Posting this because the general consensus seems to be 'anti-boil'.


After my last my last time with giganteums (8 pods + near-boiling water - microwaved on high for 40 minutes and left to sit for 5 hours (puked next day, twice), I was a little apprehensive.


I went for 5 giganteums, placed in a saucepan of boiling water and reduced to a simmer for 20 minutes. Ok - I got a little high but needed a repeart perormance.


Shortly after, I took 5 more pods and combined the previously crushed (totally not ground) pods from before in the saucepan.


Very mellow, passed out whilst masturbating - partially thanks to 40-50mg vaium.


So-so. Recollection the following day was blurredl

Anyone ever steep their grounds in cold water? It works just as good as hot for me, and the high feels cleaner, doesn't taste as bad either. I usually let it steep overnight though.

Sweet I had no idea this thread existed. I have a question for ya'll:


I ordered "Blue Organic Poppy Seeds", kosher and I assume because they are organic they are unwashed. Does the fact that they are blue have anything to do with the alkaloid content? Should these be just as good or, as I would assume, more potent than the normal because they come from a specialty store and are organic?

When codeine is ingested it must first be converted into morphine inside the body before it has any "positive effects"...For the conversion to take place the CYP-450 enzyme must be present so inhibiting it would lead to lower conversion and thus lower "positive effects"...I would assume this also holds true for Poppy tea since the solubility of morphine in water is low and codeine is very soluble it would be safe to assume the tea is mostly codeine unless a form of calcium is added.

Hey jykke,


I am not saying you are wrong while you could be insanely right and im missing out,but what about poppy seed tea.  doesnt that alone *Prove* the soluability of the alkoid morphine in water?  if not, why would someone have overdosed on PST and had 550 plus mgs of morphine in his system? -- and yesterday, i know it was a stronger buzz than codiene cuz i done codiene sulphate or somethin like that and i was much higher. but alas i have taken your advice and going to give the calcium thing a try :O) thanks for the info.

Two simple questions:


1. Does adding calcium carbonate to the mix really effect it's potency? Going to try it.


2. French press is the preferred method here. Will using a sock , cheese cloth, etc to squeeze the last bit out of the steeped powder make a large difference, or am I just getting another ounce of the same potency liquid?

the remaining liquid is pretty much worth nothing.

I'm afraid that it will make me throw up even if I don't eat the plant material. I took morphine in pill form once and I got sick. Tramadol makes me sick now... jeez why is it so hard to get a good opiate high?

Thanks. That's what I figured. I assumed the little bit of liquid in the pulp wouldn't be significantly more potent, but I wanted to make sure.


Anyone have an answer to my other question?


Does adding calcium carbonate to the mix really effect it's potency?


It seems to me that this is not the case. True, it will raise the pH, which is a step in making the morphine fall out of the liquid... but like others have said, isn't that pointless if you are making tea? Wouldn't you not want the morphine to fall out? Unless, of course, calcium morphenate (?) is more potent or has a higher bio-availability somehow?


I just want to make sure throwing a few Tums into a tea won't magically make it significantly more potent.

^

raw resin is not worth it grounds would just be a waste of pods 


with a little work and a fridge you can refine it , do a search on ice extraction technique

Puking on pod tea isn't anywhere near as bad as you'd imagine. In fact, it is probably the least unpleasant substance I've ever had the misfortune to vomit. I don't know if this is specific to me but the actual mechanics of the puking were far more streamlined than alcohol-based puking or alternatives.


There was a clear warning, then two or three strong coughs (minus the mass of saliva/stomach juices that I normally get with alcohol) and the pod tea did a good job of projecting itself out of my stomach and into the toilet bowl.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


I'm not going to lie to you about one thing - pod puke that gets stuck in the nose really smells/tastes (smell is contributory to taste after all) horrible![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  - you really want to get that crap out ASAP.


on a brighter note - I only puked when I took stupid doses, specifically when I redosed whilst nodding (why? Just plain why Spellman???).


So, take 2 or 3 giganteums and grind them to a coarse, near-powder state - more 'flake' than grain. Boil a kettle of water but stop it a short time before the water actually boils and bubbles like crazy. Put the ground pod material in a pyrex jug, add enough water to fill a standard sized mug + a little more. 


Microwave at the 700 watt setting for 15/20 minutes. You may need to stop the process every 5 minutes if your jug is too small, and stir - I've had a few mishaps that resulted in a microwave/kitchen that smelt of pod tea for several days.


Strain the green goo through a fine mesh tea strainer and leave to cool for a few minutes. Drink half, perhaps have a cup of juice (I recommend pineapple) to help with the taste. Wait at least an hour (preferably more) then drink the other half if nothing is happening.


You could be getting old pods or even the wrong strain (I credit you with too much intelligence for that but wanted to put the idea out there).


When you do find a method that works, you'll get to the stage where you look at the liquid in the pyrex dish after cooking and *you'll know* if this is going to be a strong brew.

I was throwing up once a week from Tramadol and illness, I think I'll avoid it. 

I think me and ppt won't be friends. 

Is there such a thing as "bad pods" what would cause that?

Bottom line? Powder up calcium carbonate supplements, add them to your very lightly boiling tea, stir, and then filter off the poppy gunk for huge win. This step will convert the water-insoluble morphine into water-soluble calcium morphenate, meaning your plain old codeine tea turns into supercharged morphine and codeine tea. Keep the tea, throw away the plant matter, and enjoy. All for not too much more than your normal tea process.

This can be easily refined further (converted to morphine hydrochloride) to increase purity, and if you really wanted to, you could do another simple step or two after extracting and actually cook up some heroin. Converting the morphine base to Hcl isn't required before this, but doing so will increase purity. The next step would produce ~70% pure heroin base which then could be converted to the Hcl.

I figure that while the rules don't allow synthesis discussion, the process I outlined above involves changing the makeup of the tea so the morphine alkaloids become water soluble, potentiating the tea greatly. This is written for making enough for just one sitting and not some sort of mass production, which is another reason for leaving out the exact details on extraction.

There are about 35 of them, including thebaine, which is an essential component in the manufacture of oxycodone, oxymorphone, and buprenorphine.  This  makes it very interesting and sought-after to someone wanting to get the most they can out of the poppy.

How many pods XXL size (little bit smaller than tennis balls) would it take to get 20mg of morphine, Or I should ask, how much morphine to large pods produce pod for pod, I know theres no exact #, but I'd like an estimation, also

I am currently W/Ding from OxyCodone, Would this help, or would this just make it worse in the long run?

It's really hard to even give a good estimation, although the general consensus seems to be that *p. somniferum* are typically 5-15% morphine in their alkaloid content.  With absolutely no opiate tolerance, I got some significant euphoria/nod/warmth off of 8 XXL pods with no potentiators.  Then again, I'm a rather large person (weighing in at 250lbs/113kg, 6'3"/190cm) which kind of gives me an inherent, albeit kind of negligible, tolerance.


If you are trying to get off of oxycodone, I'd recommend talking to a buprenorphine or methadone treatment specialist.

^

I think i read a ballpark estimate of 5 mg somewhere of course it varies hugely


also if your pods are fresh they will be 2 as potent as dried ones


also i noticed industrially grown pods(ie store bought goes for dried and fresh) have nothing on pods that are found outside wonder why 


ps. im so happy my florist got me a bunc h of fresh chicks and hens , great stuff


and on topic . the most bang for your buck method of taking poppies is putting them in a blender with some grapefruit juice and chug the result

Im a rather skinny person 6'0 and 145.

I have a 25-30mg oxycodone tolerance.

I would guess that 5-6 pods would give me quite a small buzz or hold off w/d.

And I was curious as to if you could refine the solution to make it pluggable, I've made poppy seed tea with 2lbs of seeds (and 1lb) , and my stomach produces unbelievable cramps, (Same for me with Most all opiates,hence why I plug them most of the time, plus it adds to bioavailablity) 

Anywho, Any info in making this product more refined (so you dont have to plug a few ounces of water, lolol) would be much appreciated, thank you.

It will be extracted w/ the calcium.


To others in the thread, yes, if u heat the ground up pods you will get all the morphine and everything else. But i'd rather not go through all the trouble of eating all that nasty shit.

Curious, how do you basify the tea to make it ready to plug?


And when you're making the tea, do you empty the seeds out before putting the pod in the coffee grinder?


Does hot water really make a difference? I thought you were supposed to used cold water , since morphine is destroyed at a relatively low temperature....


and how long should you aggitate the mix for , or do you just let it sit in the water 


(I'm used to making PST, would making poppy pod tea in the same way be effective?)


can I let it evaporate to plug it?

Anyone know the effectiveness of this?

**Merged: Ultimate poppy pod tea thread (getting the most out of your pods)**


So here's the deal.  Tomorrow I have work at 7am ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)  and I am currently going through withdrawal from oxy addiction.  It becomes very difficult to function at work when I'm junk sick and if I miss work one more day I'll probably be fired. Which CAN"T happen or I am fucked.


I have some poppy pop tea. and  I want to have it ready for tomorrow morning so I'm not late.  Being late would be another way I could be fired.  Therefore, I want to make it tonight and let it sit overnight.  Is it cool to just leave it out, room temp,  uncovered? covered? Or should i refrigerate?  Is it bad to microwave shortly to heat up before drinking tomorrow, or will it affect potency?  I was searching the forums and didn't see anything about preserving poppy tea for future consumption.  I was curious to know what the best way to do this is...cuz I've left a mug with a little tea left sitting out for a few days and noticed it picks up a nasty scent after a while so obivously thats bad.  But is  overnight cool? And just wondering, how long can it last?  i only got one more dose left so I don't wanna fuck it up. thanks.

Just treat it like a food item man. Don't leave it out for flies to land in it. stick it in the fridge, covered or something. not hard.


You left a beverage made from improperly pasteurized uncleaned plant matter, left it out, and everything in there started to grow. lol. Thats what happens.

currently making tea, using double boiler , and added some lemon juice for acidity , I will be evaporating it at a low temperature to get a small ammount of solution to plug


(Morphine is about 20% more soluble rectally, so , might as well give it a shot)

I mean in the past ive done CWE and just wondered if this would effect my tollerance to  PPT. Because obviously if you do it again and again you need more to get high. Get Me ?


EDIT:- I mean CWE with CO-Codomal in the past, not at the same time as PPT.

EDIT AGAIN:- What im tryin to say does CWE with co codomol have a cross tollerance with PPT ?

doodcwe is just a way of not taking aspirin


obviously not taking aspirin/paracetamol is not going to affect your opiate tolerance


taking opiates will (ie codeine)

Yeah I know that, I was wondering if taking codeine (CWE) will up my tollerance to PPT ? As is codeine not in Poppy Heads ?

Oh, yes, if you take opiates on a regular basis , you would have a tolerance to PPT, since it also contains opiates.


But, if it's been a while since you've taken any opiates, then you shouldn't have much of a tolerance.

**1st time PPT**


so I am currently enjoying my 1st ppt experience, I ground to a powder 5 huge pods and and added to boiling water and immeadiatley removed from heat and let sit for about 20 minutes, strained, and drank.  The effects were noticable but not quite strong enough.  I used the puddy for a 2nd brew.  I don't use opiates regularly but do seem have always had a natural tolerence for some reason.  So I just ground up 3 more and opted for the coffee maker method.  Ran it through 4 time just to be sure, just gulped it down.  Wish me luck!![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif)

**Poppy pods**


I've been reading up on these a lot the past couple days. The poppy pods I would have available seem to be very small in size. The heads are even smaller than a golf ball I'd say. Also, the stems are a good 8 to 10 inches long. They're very skinny stems, but still prominent to say the least. I have quite a large tolerance to opiates, so I'm wondering A. What would be the best way for me to measure these out into a dose, and B. Should I use the stems, or save them for another time and only use the heads for now?


Thanks

Stick with the heads for now, tho the stems do contain a little opium. 


There's no way of judging a dose other than start with 3, then 5 etc until you find a dose you're comfortable with.

Ok that sounds good. I wasn't sure about the stems and couldn't find anything saying for sure whether right now would be the appropriate time to use them since I still have the heads available too. I bought I coffee grinder to use to grind the heads, I don't have a scale with me, should I try to measure out a certain amount in a measuring cup?


Basically I need a minimum of 80mg ox oxycodone orally to do anything, so I wouldn't like to undershoot the dosing.

The best way to measure a dose is by weight.


Grind your de-stemmed pods up in a blender or coffee grinder.  (take the crown off, along with the stem and knuckle of the stem....save these for after the pods are gone)


With a tolerance of 80mg oral oxycodone to get high, I'd start with a 20gram dose of pod.  


UTSE if you need help making the tea. (its not hard, just dont use boiling water...soak for at least 20 minutes)


As a side note..... a 20 gram dose may not even do much for YOU.  I just say that so you can make sure you can stomach the tea and to make sure your not overly sensitive to it for whatever reason.


Me personally, I need about 100mg of oxycodone  to get high.  My pod dose is around 50grams........


Edit: just realized you said you have no scale.   if your pods are a little smaller than a golf ball, I'd say one would weight about 3 to 4 grams.

I've only been using the pods, I have been taking off the stem and the very top of the pod...., I was curious if the very top of the pod, or the stem, can be used to make a type of tea, (Is the top of the pod just the same as the rest of it?)


Also, are the seeds out of the pods easier to get a wash from, I have saved the seeds from about 100 pods, and was planning on washing them, should I expect any effects?)

**Thoughts on taste?**


So far, I've come to this conclusion:


i. The enjoyment of an experience involving X grams of giganteum Vs X grams of small pods is far higher (i.e. giganteum sized pods give better highs and more likelihood of nodding hard).


ii. Giganteum teas prepared identically to those with smaller pods, taste more of the plant material (despite not consuming the plant material) and are far more alkaline/disgusting in taste terms.


iii. Greener = better. I've had several shades of brown but the greener teas were the ones that knocked me off my ass and kepy my pupils pinpoint for an absolute age.


iv. Blue seeds = fresher, stronger pods <---- still not sure about this but I crack open a pod and the seeds are brown, I throw the pod away (a mixture of blue/brown isn't a problem however).


v. 'The crack' means ? ? ? I've heard people say that a louder 'snap' when breaking open a pod = more alkaloids. I am uncertain as I've made tea with pods that were more 'latex-like' in texture and didsn't have a snap factor.

Hello all.


I usually take hydro's for pain, most likely not enough as I usually have to take double the script.  So I run out.  Something I hope to address at the next doc appt.  Running out leaves me in w/d with my pain exaggerated.  Fun times.  I've been an avid opiate watcher since youth, so I know my way around.  Abit.  I get the tea to hopefully keep the w/d's off and the pain gone.  I dunno if I'm doing it wrong?  I do get a nice thick coloured liquid, so its in there.  Yet - last night i sat around and sat around and sat around.. waiting to be released from my aches and pains.  Not the w/d aches and pains as I managed to skip around that this time with tramadol, but friggin pain.  I was buzzed pretty good I think, but the pain wasn't completely gone.  I love my hydro's cos they make the pain like it was never there.  Poof gone.  I tried eating some of pod material at a later time... which might of increased the buzz?  Dunno.  I've also restoril and tramadol.  Yet abit unsure about combining.  I want to be pain free, not dead.  Usually the tramadol kills half of my pain.  


Here are my questions.  I've read about the calcium.  Does it really work?  Can I eat a few tums while drinking the tea or do I have to throw them in?  As its steeping now.


I usually just get a glass of water.. microwave it for about 2 minutes (near boiling) and than throw in ground up pods and let steep for ages upon ages.  Until the liquid isn't hot.  I don't measure by pods.  I measure by tablespoons of grounds.  I think last night I used 8 tblspoons?  Not sure what it is in pods though.  I grind it all up at once.  I don't add lemon.  The taste doesnt bother me.


Am I using enough?  I wonder if its not enough water?  The glass is full from top to bottom with grounds and I usually get about a fist full of grounds when i wring them out.


Should I try 50 mg of tramadol combined?  Is it safe?


Any suggestions?

Omg - I havent felt this good in I dont know how long.  Wow its wonderous.   What I did.... a large plastic cup of water - micro'd for 2 minutes.... than 3 min later micro'd for 1 minute.  Steeped 6 tblspoons of grounds for probably an hour?  Till the liquid was warmish.  Wrung out the grounds.  Had a nice warm greenish/brownish/honey looking colour.  Looked real rich.  Chewed 2 tabs of tums.. started drinking.  Whilst i was drinking i was taking chunks of the grounds and swallowing them with the liquid.  Not too much of it.   But it all compacts and stays together after i strain.  A couple of chunks.  Chewed another Tums.. figured it could alll mix in the stomach.  About an hour later.. slight buzz.. but nothing really.  Took a tramadol and a restoril.....


And wow.  Pain free (mostly).... mellow as hell.........  Amazing.   I almost hate to go to bed and lose it.  Lovely.  Em.  Wish the back pain was completely gone.  Wouldnt mind a spare hydro to kill the rest of the pain tho.  Other pain gone tho!


Just had to share.  Lovely.  Lovely little chilled mellowness.

could last the night in the fridge,


so you can prep it all up the night before, to have it in the morning,

thatd be ok.

I've made tea on a friday and taken it camping, it lasted all weekend unrefrigerated just fine. I even drank the last of it when I got home on monday and it was still good. Keeping it in the fridge I would expect it to last up to a week if not more.

it might go bad if the weather is hot a weekend seems to stretch it a bit

^ Yeah it wasn't hot anytime... that tea was probably kept at 75 degrees at the most. It might have even been going bad and I just didn't realize it, who knows. All I know is I didn't puke my guts up and it got me loaded ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Be sure to let us know how that carbonation thing works out. I love carbonated drinks, carbonated tea seems like it would only be an improvement.

Ok thanks for the info. I have the basics down for making it. The color seems to be consistent with how it should look. Brown tea color. But the taste isn't bad at all. And I'm kind of sensitive to the way things taste. There is some taste to it, but it's not bad at all. So maybe the pods aren't potent? I'm drinking it straight with no problem. 


Also, Is adding lemon juice or anything else really worth it? And if so, how much would be good to start at? I've been told that adding DXM to the mix also helps, but I'm not sure about that. I'd imagine taking it beforehand could help, but I was told to literally add it to the steeping tea.

**LSD**, IME pod good pod tea is very dark brown and the more opaque the better. The best tea is also so bitter I can't drink it without holding my nose and even then I gag sometimes.


This all breaks down to how much water and pod extract in the glass of course, but for an example, five pods (nine inch circumference) brewed into about 12 ounces of water ended up with a brew like described above that would be too much for a first timer


I don't add lemon juice because it's disgusting, and yeah taking dxm would potentiate it and you don't really need much


Dxm is one of the nastiest chemicals ever, adding it to the tea is a foul, horrible idea and I just puked

It's possible that I'm using too much water..or that the pods I previously had just weren't very potent. I just got a new shipment so we'll see how that goes. Does anyone know the for sure temperature morphine would actually start to be destroyed at? I have a thermometer I could use in the water to be safe.

Oh one more question, I can never think of everything at once. But basically, I hear people saying to remove the water from heat and "steep" it for a half hour, but I also hear people say to "simmer" it for that time. So which is better? My understanding is that they are 2 very different things. Basically, my question is, after I add the pods to the near boiling water, should I use little heat or no heat at all?

I find the  bes way for dried pods is too hard boil them for  a few minutes , then steep 30 minutes


for fresh pods i prefer a 20-30 min simmer or even better a cold steep which leads to a less potent brew but cleaner high and the left over material can be redone for 2 times


so i guesss it depenends on te kind of pods you have LSD

I know some people boil it to 'Clean' it but that is a rare reason. 'Clean' meaning, to kill any bacteria/germs etc... I'm not saying that's why most people do it, but i have heard a few folks say that.


When i do make the tea, i don't boil, i just use cold water and shake and soak for a god 30 minutes. Although i prefer the feel of the tea it's so much cheaper to put the grounds in apple juice and chug. As i am sure most of you know that you don't need as many grounds if you eat/chug them. But, the tea is so much easier to get down.


I just enjoyed a nice cuppa grounds. Feeling nice. but, my tolerance must be climbing because i don't feel as good as i used to on pods, but I'm sure oxy and fent have a lot to do with that. But, i only have that available for about 8-11 days a month.


Do most of you use a grinder? I need to get a new one, mine isn't getting those little long pieces of pod cut up like i would like it to. I've started sifting my grounds just to get those funky little pieces out. Ugh.


I still can't believe i can buy pods. I was just about to mentioned the vendor in that previous sentence but realized we can't do that. But, i still can't believe how easy it is to get pods or shit, even how easy it is to just go to the market and get some seeds and get good and high. That is, if you find the good seeds out there, that aren't washed a lot. I don't do seed tea that often but the seeds i use in this area are so strong, i can't believe it!


Ok pods must be kicking in, I'm rambling LOL. Sorry

**Pod Tea and itches**


I have chronic pain and use hydrocodone 10/325 (among many other medicines) and I get at least a little itch from 20mg or more. I just started drinking PPT after reading so much about it here and I have excellent results as far as analgesia and I get a pretty good feeling off of it but no itches. The pod tea I've made a few times feels like well over 20mg worth of hydrocodone to me but I have almost no itch whatsoever... have other people found equivalent amounts of pod tea to be less itchy then hydrocodone? Any hypotheses as to why this is not making me itch? (Could it mean less or more of a certain alkaloid or something?) I feel great from the tea and have better sleep than I've had in 6 months since I stopped taking oxycontin, so thanks to all those who have elucidated their experiences with the tea!

hmm, i never EVER get the itches from  poppy pod tea. I used to get itches frm oxy and other opiates but i don't anymore, strange but yea.. I never got the itches from pods though.


Anyone know anything good to battle the sedate feeling of ppt? Normally i use Tramadol to combat the slight sedate feeling of ppt but i don't have any right now. Coffee works for about 30 minutes and than it fizzles.


Is there anything else, non-opiate that can help with the lazy feeling of ppt? I guess i should make a thread and ask that.


This is why i prefer oxy but don't have access to that so I'm on my old standby ppt. I love the amped feeling i get from oxy but pods tend to make me lag.

That's a good question, Roxi, and I would be open to suggestions as well. I am on other medications that can be sedating so if anyone has good advice to combat the sedation of PPT outside of just caffeine, I'd be interested.

Merged in a question about itching on pod tea.

Keep it in here. Any stimulant would do the trick, but lowish doses so that you don't overpower the feelings you want from the pods.


Caffeine I've heard can increase the itches in some people.

Interesting... I had the same thing; I didn't get too itchy off my pod tea even though I was nicely high. Codeine makes me really itchy though.

I've heard a lot of people say not to boil them, for fear of destroying some of the morphine etc. But also, I've heard people say that morphine wouldn't begin to be destroyed until it reached about 400F. And since water boils at about 212F, I don't see how it would hurt. Maybe someone could elaborate on this. 


Also, I previously had said that my ppt wasn't too bad to drink. It had a bad aftertaste, but nothing that wasn't easily tolerated. Well I ended up getting some more from a different supplier, and to say the least, the ppt now is verrrry difficult to get down. Which is ultimately a good thing of course. And the effects now, as compared to before, are incredibly different. All in a good way of course. 


This time, before I received my batch, I went to the store and purchased some lemon juice. I was planning on adding it to the tea while it was steeping. But both times I've made ppt since then, I have forgotten to use it. Both times I've still had amazing results. I guess I'm just asking, who's had experience with adding lemon juice to their tea, and how effective it has been in comparison to using none. Thanks!

Yeah I've heard adding lemon juice, actually somehow manages to make the flavoring even worse. Regardless, at this point I can't complain about anything. Because I've been pretty gone for almost 10 hours straight now, off of about 8 dollars worth of ppt haha. I could spend 200+ dollars on OC and not feel this good. So I'm doing it right. But hey, when you're playing this game, you always have to nickel and dime the products regardless...because, well a lot of you know, it's never enough anyway.

It will stay good in the refrigerator for about a week. If you add a small amount of alcohol you can preserve it a lot longer. Don't use too much alcohol though for the sake of harm reduction.

The pods I have..are just under the size of tennis balls. I use about 8-10. And they are really thick too. So I use a good amount. They way I make them is quite simple but I'll post it anyway.


1. Break open pods, remove all seeds from inside.

2. Break pods up into little pieces, put them in a coffee bean grinder. 

3. I put the pods through 3 grind cycles, to get them as fine as possible. 

4. Boil a pot of water, an average size pot about half way full. 

5. Dump the pods in while the water is still boiling.

6. After dumping in the pods, remove from heat, occasionally stirring the pod water.

7. After about 10 mins, I turn the stove on low for about 10 more minutes. 

8. Then I turn the heat back off, and let it sit for about another 10-15 mins. 

9. Then I strain them into a bowl through a t shirt. I find trying to strain them into into a mug is harder, and you can spill (waste) some of it. So first I strain into a bowl, and then pour the liquid into a mug.


If anyone needs me to elaborate any part of my method, I'll be more than happy too. I'm actually in the process of making some right now! [=

Yeah I'll grind them up with the pods..can't hurt anything haha. But yeah..this ppt is now my favorite op. It's cheap, and very effective. Plus the high lasts a long time, which is something I'm not used to. So it's quite nice all around. 


Also, hypothetically speaking, if someone were to get a very big flower pot, would it be possible to grow poppies indoors? Not that I would, just a question out of curiosity, of course.

Seems to me I remember reading in here about the extraction process for heroin. They boil the pod mush to extract the H. I guess I can assume it's ok to boil this stuff without reducing potency. 

Personally, I seem to get better results just using very warm water. Warm enough that after a 30 minute soak, I can wring it out thru a t shirt without burning my hands.

i usually boil for 3 minutes tops


it's bad for the alkaloids but so is simmering for too long , so it comes down to getting a kind of balance between heat and time on the stove


in my experience a short boil after which i turn off the hot plate and let it sit for 30 minutes with occasional stirring is the way to go.


since my mom doesn't tolerate my behavior nowadays i do it cold water stylke which works great even seems to give a "cleaner" high , you don't get al the goodies at once though you still get a pretty brown product on the re-run


well i just had a cuppa and im a happy boy

Interesting... when I used poppy pods, I just boiled some water and let it cool down for 10 minutes or so and then did the extraction using that. Did re-washes on the filtrate as well, and would be nicely high for quite a while. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I have trouble understanding this, i know it's subjective and all. You're saying what gives you the "cleaner" high is that you're taking a smaller dose? I don't doubt what you say just wondering what you mean exactly.

Ah i see what you're saying. I noticed a difference in effects when I switched from making tea with chunks of the pod to using grounds. It made the tea much darker, and went from feeling very stimulating to more sedating. It was easy to gauge then because the type of pod was consistent. Anymore my results are skewed by the notion that different pods could contain very different alkaloid ratios. 


With all the goodies hanging out in a pod, and just what the pod is made of,  I guess changing even a small part of your technique or materials can make a big difference. And you know I find something charming about the difficulty in controlling the experience, like being in old times where everything was more crudely made and you could accidentally get a whopping dose when you're not expecting it. But I'd still like to be exact just because it's practical.

i can tell this, because i have

fresh pods, 

hot and cold for both,

and also have eaten opium, 

and orally dosed morphine and codeine, 

separately and simultaneously.


all many times.


my experiences are consistent with your observations.

So, what Bingeboy and you are saying, is a cold water wash will yield a more potent finished product? Or just a cleaner product?

err no


hot water ( NOT BOILING ) has best yield


some people don't like all the alkaloids (weirdos) and want closer to just morph&code, cold water extractions achieve this.


hot water is better


Opium is best.

I was just gathering some pods (onces too small to really score), and I got a drop of that milky white ambrosia on my hands, and I licked it. Very bitter. I actually feel high off that! Weird..or not?


But I just made a tea batch of 30 or so small pods, and this has to get me through a prescription-less weekend of back-breaking 4th of july bullshit. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

The good news : There are about 6 huge P. Sominferum that just startint growing right in my front lawn... has about 40+ pods... they are all in flowering stage


Bad News : I live really close to my neighbors and the plants are basically all out in the open... I feel like i would be super sketchy going out there and picking them... forget about scoring them ..... My neighbors main window is right next to all these pods last night i was casually smoking a cigarette next to them then just pulled a cpl .. lol


Maybe i could pretend like im doing gardening, pulling weeds, and just wait until almost all the pods are mature and just yank them all at once

Anyone have any thoughts on:-


i. The 'crack' when you break the bottom to remove the seeds. A good, 'shatter' is the best case scenario (I think) whereas a dull rip = lower quality pod.


ii. The seed colouring - blue always strikes me as a sign the pod is a good one, brown seeds (often accompanied by a stale smell inside the pod and a tendency not to crack/snap apart) don't look good.


iii. Clumping of seeds to the internal striatums of the pod - normally the heaviest clumping is with brown seeds.


Any thoughts?

Agreed. It's like judging a pickle. Want a nice snap... that dull rip means it's more stale.

Hmmm I haven't noticed any brown seeds really, unless the inside of the pod had mold and it was all over the seeds as well. Even in the stale pods, the seeds have all been very nice blues.


> iii. Clumping of seeds to the internal striatums of the pod - normally the heaviest clumping is with brown seeds.

You're talking dried pods yeh? I don't see the seeds clump on the inside of the pod much either. Unless like before if there is the black/brown dry crumbly mold on the inside of the pod the seeds get all trapped in it. If there is no mold the seeds are always ready to just pour out.


This is my experience from many kinds of pods too, btw.

Ive just been grinding up whole pods in a coffee grinder and putting the whole mess into my simmering water etc. 

Is that ok, or should I be removing the seeds, or at least checking inside the pods for ^ brown weirdness?


Another thing is that Ive been 'thinning' around the bigger pods, and picking the smaller pods, some very tiny. Am I wasting my time with the tiny ones? They're all crowned up and all, not dry and rattling, but ripe for scoring. 

My tea seems a little weak, but my tolerance might be higher than I thought. 

Seeing all those warnings about 'accidental overdoses' had me thinking I was gonna be nodding off or feeling really wonkey. 

Im tempted to go pick 3 or 4 of the *giant* ones and see if they knock me loose for awhile rather than 30 little tiny guys.

ATF: Definately remove the seeds. They have oils / fats that make your tea less pleasant to drink and don't add any potency.


If you're talking about fresh pods, I don't think you have to worry about mold on the inside as much as dried pods that have been stored for some time. But you may as well check them since it's so easy..


The little ones still contain opium. 3 or 4 giant pods (tennis ball size) is my common dose, maybe a little higher. And that's dried pods. I've gotten quite sick from 6 pods before. Pretty bad overdose but not life threatening. Fresh ones should be much stronger.

no, thats totally untrue.


real opium is far superior to pod tea,

water does not dissolve all opiates to the same degree.


and if you mean you take the pod off to get the opium,

that is also ridiculous,

as one obtains far greater yields with the method:

score, 

wait 12 hours,

collect,

wait 4 days,

score,

wait 12 hours,

collect,

wait 4 days,

chop for tea.


you see, after you score them, and obtain the opium,

more is produced-

so why waste the production potential,

by destroying the pod, before it has produced the maximum possible amount of opium?

but most of those pods do not look like *P. Somniferum*.

usually other poppies are smaller pods.


a notable exception is *P. Orientalis*,

which can often fool the amateur poppy-hunter:

as you can see, quite similar-

but the crowns are darker,

and the overall pod shape tends toward an up-side-down triangular,


rather than the bulbous, to oval, pod shape,

and lighter crown of *P. Somniferum*:

I use Apple Juice. Since it's so sweet it covers the foul taste fairly good. I've tried many different beverages over the last year and half and apple juice by far is the best. But, i have heard that yogurt is a good way to go. A friend of mine swears by it.

well, wouldn't be weird if you'd eaten about 1/2 tsp of it.


the raw, undried opium latex is not worth eating.


it is very bitter, burns your mouth, and is much less efficient,

than letting it ooze out, then slowly drying into real opium.

eat a ball of the real opium about 1/4-3/8" across.


maybe up the dosage slowly if you O is weak, or you have too much tolerance.


careful though, remember, 

twice the diameter of the sphere means EIGHT TIMES the volume,

hence mass, hence dosage.

I think all crowns darken as they get really mature but the easiest way to tell is the shape of the crown... THe actually design of the crown is what helps me identify papaver somniferum it is very unique ... the orientalis crown looks very rigid triangles and not smoth little circles

**On washing/storing pods**


Hello.  Just had a quick few questions I couldn't find using the search engine or anywhere else on the internet for that matter...


Okay, I've asked my vendor multiple times whether her poppy pods are grown using any chemical pesticides, herbicides, etc, which she's never answered and seems to be avoiding.  Would it be okay to just rinse them under running water prior to crushing them like you do with fruit/veggies?  Would this interfere with the consistency or potency in any way?  Would it even help get rid of pesticides if there were any?  How common is it to use chemicals on pods grown in the U.S.?  And have any of you had or heard of any reactions to pesticide use on pods...if so, what were they?


My other question was this:  how do you store your pods/powder if you buy in bulk?  I can't seem to find a straight answer on this...is it okay to put them in the freezer in Ziplock bags, or will this negatively affect them in some way?


Thanks!![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)

Uh to you people saying tea is mostly codeine. You are dead wrong. Codeine is only like 0.5%-1% in the pods. Morphine is 8-15% Codeine has little role in the intoxication.


Here's way. Codeine is not effective to swim for liver reasons I guess. I think he fall in the 10% population that doesnt that the gene.


PT kicks SWIM's ass, he uses 10 giant pods. Lasts all day.


To the other dude. I can't get off (sexually) either. And swim has fell asleep trying ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Of course a vendor won't answer that.  They're sold under the guise of being for decoration.  Maybe you want to ask the vendor what the best way of preparing them for drinking is while you're at it.  Ask which ones have the most morphine by weight too.


Congrat's, you managed to find the world's stupidest vendor.  You give up the game and let them know what you're really on about and they continue selling to you.


Or, maybe you're the moron- for all you know you're being sold pods by a DEA agent and giving up information about yourself.

You should be fine running them under a tap to get rid of pesticides; but if these are being sold with the blind eye turned to consumption, then they should be fine.

Obviously I gave a justification for wanting to know about the pesticides OTHER than consumption...some people actually DO have chemical sensitivities and DON'T want things in their homes that have been shown to cause all manner of disease, even in small concentrations.  I asked this vendor what strain these were BEFORE asking her that, which she also failed to answer, so it appears to me she's just ignorant of what she's selling or lazy.

I just edited your post, Lady Codone, and removed the ones below (you know who you are ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)).


Ham's post, whilst blunt, certainly did not warrant that reaction and as I say above, if you have a problem let a moderator know; don't clutter up a thread with this stuff. 


He has a point though; vendors are selling a product that is, if I remember correctly, not exactly legal and well known by the authorities to be used for drug purposes. You're not going to get many answers out of them, lest they think you are a DEA member trying to catch them at their game. Washing them off should be good enough, but if you are really concerned about pesticides and other chemicals then maybe you shouldn't be using pods, or any street drugs at all since you have no idea what they have been contaminated with. 


As for storing them, freezing won't do any harm. It's boiling that's the kicker.

So I'm down to stems now. My next package won't be here til tomorrow morning. Seems like forever. The high from these poppies is better than pretty much anything I've tried. And I've tried just about everything. But on the other hand, the withdrawal is horrible. Just horrible. So I'll use my stems to hold me over. 


I also have quite a few white flowers I've found within some of my pods. I've been told you can smoke these? I have no clue how true this is. Anyone have any idea?

Is it really that much more dangerous to use seeds than pods? I can't see why, if one part of the plant can vary so much in morphine content (Seeds), another part can also vary a lot (pods).


I can't get pods but organic seeds are available pretty cheap. I'm thinking about making some tea from about 250g of seeds then increasing subsequently if this isn't enough. I can't see this being too dangerous; the kid who died was using almost 1600mg of seeds...

The yeild to get oipum from scraping is so dam low its not even worth it unless you have over 100 pods........ It takes like hundreds of pods to get a couple of grams of opium..........

I hear people saying to remove the seeds from the pods before crushing and soaking the pods. The reason being the seeds just add extra unwanted alkaloids and offer no potency to the mixture. Then, I'm seeing threads that explain how to soak the seed for maximum potency for consumption. I'm also reading about kids dropping over from od'ing from these seeds.

Yes, most people remove the seeds. One reason is so you can save them for *emergency* seed tea. Although seeds from pods aren't as potent as store bought seeds because the poppy pods we buy aren't lanced like the seeds from pods that we buy at the store. 


This is what i read somewhere on line and have heard from many people. But, you still can save them and   1) keep saving them until you have a shit load of them and make some tea to get you well (not high) or   2) save them and mix with some store bought seeds to make them even stronger (But not by much).


There are other reasons as well. Personally i don't like seeds in my poppy pod grounds.

^ Yeah. The seeds do have nasty fatty alkaloids that can make you nauseous, the seeds also have some opium alkaloids on the outside of them, but the majority of it is in the pods. You can save the seeds and try seed tea later. You make seed tea by soaking the seeds in warm water for a short while, you make pod tea by using hotter water either on the stove or you can use a coffee maker. Just make sure to use hot water to extract the morphine. Cold water will mostly only get the codeine out. I'm going to merge this with the ultimate poppy pod thread.

Just went down to the shops and had a look at all the poppy seed brands in the supermarkets. Most just say poppy seeds; about half are Australian and half imported.


However I noticed on one of the brands, it specifies **Papaver rhoeas** seeds which are the seeds of the common Corn poppy and hence do not contain morphine etc. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_rhoeas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papaver_rhoeas)


Anyway so I bought 250gm of a different brand, making up some tea now. Will report back later. Hope I got **Papaver somniferum** seeds!

How stupid do you have to be to email a vendor and basically ask them to admit to a crime? Of course they will deny they are selling P.somniferum pods, you bet your ass I would! 


Look I don't know why so many people are so damn nervous and worried about ordering pods, whether its fear of getting another kind of pod or pods coated in paint or chemicals when everyone else is getting their pods fine I don't get it.


Look do you really think there is that brisk a business in selling dry florals? Do you think a vendor could keep afloat selling only one kind of dried floral if it was not psychoactive? Do you think there would be many repeat customers in the feedback if it was not opium poppy pods?


I have ordered from many vendors, and not once have I ever received anything other then opium poppy pods, and they have never been painted or treated.

These vendors know what they are selling, they know what their customers are buying their product for. Selling other kinds of pods or painting their pods or spraying them with chemicals would very shortly DESTROY their business period. 


Can we put a rest to this horseshit please? This is a grey market item so a little common sense is required, or does anyone expect a GCMS sheet with your order specifying alkaloid content too?

I milk until they stop producing.


then use the pods for tea.


maximum yield possible, my friend.


btw i get maybe a couple grammes from less than 100,

8-20 hours is ideal. 

(I normally go for between 10-18h. above 20 begins to go too solid.

below 8, can be too runny- spesh cuz i live in england, can get some pretty cold weather this time of year.)


If it is sunny, 5-6 may suffice, but you will find some undried O in there.

it will dry out quite quickly, once scraped off.

On the grounds of both harm reduction, and preventing you from wasting your time,

I recommend not to use Poppy seed tea.

There is no possible way to gauge the alkaloid content.


Either plant somnis and make opium/use for tea,

or buy dried pods.

Seed tea doesn't suck ass. Look, i have a very high Fent and oxy tolerance and i can still feel seed tea, all be it, not as well as i did prior to starting oxy and fent and pods.


I used to only take tramadol and i was addicted to it for 3 years. I than learned about poppy seed tea, made some and it knocked me off my ass. But, i had a low opiate tolerance at the time BUT i still can feel seed tea even at my  current tolerance but i don't feel it  as much as i used to.


Also... when i haven't had fent, oxy or pods for a while and i make seed tea, it gets me higher than fuck. 


If you have a low opiate tolerance than seeds should get you nice and high.


Just because it doesn't work for YOU for what ever reason, doesn't mean it sucks. I use it when i have nothing else and it's saved my ass quite a few times. If it sucked, i wouldn't go spend 30-40 bucks on a shit load of seeds to get high when i have nothing else.

What's this about seeds from a pod being useless due to lancing? Or something like that, anyway RPG I think you brought it up before.


I've tried making seed tea  bunch of times using a whole lot of seeds and felt absolutely nothing. These were seeds I had taken straight from dried pods, so I assumed they should be even better than from the store. But this is not the case?

I can't find anywhere that sells dried pods in Australia, and I'm not going to plant poppies, so that's why I'm using seeds.


Also, I know there's no way to gauge the content of the seeds, but how can you do this for pods? Show me the evidence that says all pods contain a similar amount of active ingredients, including those at both ends of the seed strength spectrum.


I can't see how, without objective evidence, one can expect that part of the poppy plant remains relatively stable in active content, regardless of origin, growing conditions etc, while simultaneously knowing that another part (the seeds) differ by a huge amount in active content.

well the seeds contain no alkaloids, whereas the rest of pod is producing opium all the time.


so pods contain an amount, generally within reasonable limits,

usually similar within the same batch, good idea to crush them all at once, homogenize, then assess how many tsp/grammes you need.


however, any alkaloids found on the seeds have come from damaged internal pod membranes,

allowing the opium to seep out onto the seeds.

if this hasn't happened, there are NO alkaloids on the seeds.

likewise, if every pod got bruised, the seeds will have LOTS of alkaloids on them.


so, with opium, the range is generally similar 8-12% morph.

with pods, can vary (as mass of opium) sometimes as much as twice itself.

(that is, one batch may need 10, the next, 20)

with seeds, the alkaloid content can be anything from 0% - ???


So, that is why seeds suck.


morphine definitely doesn't suck,

and you get that on some seeds.


sometimes.


sometimes you get NOTHING


sometimes you get HIGH


sometimes you get TOO MUCH


with no way of even guessing what the likely dose will be,

unlike the producing parts of the plant,

and the product, itself.

OK. I guess this is why its said that you only need to wash the outside of the seeds, this makes sense if they don't contain any active ingredients themselves.


The homogenisation idea sounds pretty smart, especially if you're buying online in large quantities.  Guess I'll just have to look harder around local retailers.


Is anyone aware of the legal status of pods in Australia?

Thats pretty much what I told him, but he likes to do strange things like that. 

It apparently gave him a mellow buzz, but it had been used for several batches of tea.


So is eating the poppy material instead of brewing it up the most effective means of ingesting that stuff? Regardless of taste...

First of all, I wanted to tell you all how glad I am to have stumbled upon Bluelight & this thread, simultaneously.  At some time I'll tell you a story, that will expound on that, but for now, I have what I hope will be a fairly quick question.


Take a girl, who's been doing Opiates (Hydryo, H, Meth) for around 20 years.  She weighs about 125.  Right now she has some prescription Oxy-Con for her back, but 80mg don't seem to do much.  She has read a good number of the pages of this thread, and  gleaned the following: use a coffee grinder, a french press, almost boiling water, add calcium carbonate, steep for 20 min. & pour.  Since she possess all items, she tried 6 large pods upon delivery, but felt something rather like nothing (except a nasty taste, even when mixed with tea & sugar).  How many large pods would a long-time user recommend?  Any other recommendations?  


Many thanks for your help (and apologies for any redundancy of other postings).

Why are you paying $30-$40 on seeds? Are you getting them in bottles at the grocery store? You know you can get them at farmer's markets and the like for about $2-$4 per pound?

Dezyna, unfortunately, it's impossible to answer your question without knowing exactly which pods you have ingested. I too have a tolerance and I usually use 9-10 pods. YMMV, of course. 


Tolerance builds really quickly with pods IME, so I think it's best to rotate pod use with the use of different opiates. There are some very knowledgeable people on BL who will be able to tell you why this is, but I do know that pods contain a wide range of opiates and I would guess that that has something to do with building tolerance so quickly. IME tolerance builds as quickly as that of OC so that may be of use to you.


If you can afford it, titrate up from 8 or 9 pods and see what happens. I wouldn't go crazy and use 20 pods or anything because I've found (apart from the risk of OD) that doing too many pods produces a very unpleasant  high (huge body load, sweating, nausea, severe headache).

ah^

I think i experienced that recently ~ ive been taking opiates for almost a year regularly, never more than a few norcos, a couple methadone, or a half of an oxy at a time, but usually every few hours.

The poppy tea has always seemed so subdued and never did much for me except postpone the hurt (which actually is a very good thing). 

So I tried stronger tea, in a greater quantity, hoping for some euphoria or itchies or something! 

But I just got tired with stomach cramps, dizziness, headaches, etc.

Tried 8 yesterday.  However while waiting for steep, did a wash on some remaining cottons.  Left the tea for a few hours, and came back to drink it later. Resulted in similar sort of nothing.  Ended up spending most of day in bed with bone pain, despite Oxy (with little experience with this, not sure of correct dose here either.


Finally feeling sort of decent today, found surprise hidden balloon, while waiting for steep of last 12 pods (planning to drink slowly), and did that instead.  It ended up steeping for almost 2 hrs. and now there's a cup of cold tea, mixed with apple juice (thanks to Roxi), to be sipped on.


Not knowing age & experience of those who are raving about it, makes it difficult to know if it will ever be satisfying.  i.e. get no kicks from Vico, 4's, or even the Oxy.   Never ran across Fent.   Maybe another pod variety should tried (Arizona was used).  Just read that Taz is loaded with thebaine.  Or maybe Turk.  


Not sure how many $'s (of already depleted accounts) should be spent on this experiment.  Am also afraid of headaches/nausea.


About varying with other opiates, don't know of many others available.  This is all in attempt to finally stop doing push-ups and punching holes.  It never overtook most other parts of life, i.e. many other priorities, and don't want to start spending major hours on this either.  Or becoming a major bore.![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Don't give up! I'm pretty sure the trick is finding the right kinds...and unfortunately I can't help you with that. My experience with pods is from a friend ordered several hundred online and ended up giving a ton away. The first time I only did 4 and got pretty damn rocked off of it.

so i'm going to try my first tea every tonight. i've done 20mg of opana last week. and thought it was kind of weak. i was high, talkative, feeling happy, euphoric. but didn't nod like i've seen a friend nod from the same amount. i've done a couple of opiates. one time i did 14 2mg suboxone. so it's safe to say i have somewhat of a med/intermediate tolerance. so put 4 pods into a coffee grinder. put about 12oz. of water in a kettle and turned the heat on for about 3 mins. turned it off, let it sit there for about 5 mins. i just put the powder in. it was extremely fine. but much better then when i tried just crushing it in one of those garlic wooden crushers.  so i'm letting them just sit there in the hot water. gonna let it sit there for 20 mins. then i'm going to turn the heat on again for 5 mins. stir it all occasionally. then let it sit for about 10 mins and then will consume. will let everyone know of the results.  i think i might need more, but whatever. i'll start at 4. i have 6 pods left.

oh crap. when i lit the stove on again at the 2nd time heating it. it kinda bubbled a little bit. it was on for 7 mins on extremely low. and it prolly bubbled for like 2 mins. i hope it didn't damage it much. now i'm gonna let it sit there for about 15 mins, then drink it. i also added some lime when i was re-heating the water with the grounds.

Even when you find a good source, the variation between batches is huge.


I tried some giganteums from my current supplier a few months ago and thought they were good but not incredible. A few days ago, I got another batch... 


(between the first time I tried giganteums and now, I'd used mediums/large/jumbo pods)


The latest batch was incredible. I had my doubts because they looked like freaks of nature size-wise in comparison to prior so-called giants. They were the hardest pods I've ever encountered and just breaking them into small enough pieces to fit in the grinder was hard. 


Long story short - two giganteums equalled a helluva tea, about the same buzz I'd get from 12 large pods. I was so chilled + had to clean a house for visitors that I resorted to popping dexedrine after dexedrine tablet and I cleaned for 7 hours, stopping for about a minute to fill a pint glass and drink it, refill and drink it (in the space of about 15 seconds) before continuing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^sounds good spellman. i however didn't have such a good experience. i felt it. it was alright but too mild for me. i wanted to be nodding and everything.  i did a tea with 4 pods. and then about 2 and 1/2 hrs i did another tea with 6 pods. i'm still feeling it. but i'm tired too. this was my first time doing it but i think what messed it up too was doing some opana 4 days ago. i need to find a new supplier

Do you (or anyone) know anything about the dif between giganteum, turk & taz, or those that don't seem to have specific variety noted at all?


Or do you really think they all simply depend on the batch, and all can be equal, at different times?

^

all can be different but i have the feeling that gigantemums are usually stronger than other kind of  pods for the same amount of material weight wise


but yes it can vary a lot for any of them


oh and wild poppies or home-grown are always a lot more potent than bought poppies in my experience this goes especially for the fresh ones and if you though there is a lot of variation in potency for store bought poppies try fresh outdoor poppies (sometimes the latex is pink instead of white and it will be from a plant standing a foor further away weird , oh and the pods that bleed purple are the strongest i ever had)

i would say 2-3 months before the hottest month of the year , well i dont have anye experience with growing poppies in a mediterrenean climate but over here (netherlands) if i plant in end april/may i will be able to harvest in  the end of july beginning of august.


What's more important is the moment yo harvest them , in 2 weeks time the potency can vary by 50% , it's better to harvest them in the afternoon and when it's dry . For the timing it will be after the crowns have turned up and the pods will start to get a kind of white glazing , check out the inside of the pods you want the seeds to be white/ yellowish and the pod should be very fresh like a cucumber not leatherly like

For what its worth I have been using pods for years, usually daily.

My current use is thus:


Wipe pod with towel

Break off stem at the "knuckle"

Crack pod in half and empty out seeds

Crush pod halves in hand into a coffee grinder

Grind til fine powder

Mix powder with a few ounces of water(temp doesn't matter)

Chug and chase with something sweet


The key I have found is grinding to a fine powder, and consuming the grounds.


Water temp doesn't matter, voodoo kitchen chemistry doesn't matter.


I've been doing this for years and this is my REAL WORLD TM experience.

**A couple of questions about PPT**


* I've been eating what I expect are mouldy pods. Every morning I've woken up where my legs have gone numb and it takes an hour to get the circulation going again so that I can walk. Could this be a symptom of mould-poisoning?


* I need about 400g of ordinary strength PPs to get a mild buzz. Does this mean my tolerance to morphine is rediculously high? I'm not addicted.


* Does 'pasturising' the PPT, so that it's boiled and cooled 4-5 times, reduce the potency of the final product a lot? I've heard morphine gets destroyed in boiling temperatures.

Not sure about the numbness, try giving the pods a break though or finding a new source if you do believe that's the case.


400 grams, could quite possibly be a lot; what dose did you start out on? They could just be weak pods or yes, that could be a hella big tolerance.


Boiling does damage the alkaloids, there's no need to boil when you're making the tea.

swim did a tea out of 11oz of seeds. used cold water, shook for about 3-5 mins. filtered it and drank it quick. been 45 mins. nothing. i wasn't expecting much though. it was store bought seeds. organic seeds. at least when he did the pods, felt something about 30mins later.

**Poppy Pod Question: Where are the Alkaloids concentrated?**


I am new to the poppy pod extraction technique and have been doing some research on it and made a few batches myself.  One thing I have not found the answer to is where are most of the active alkaloids found at in the dried pods?  Are they in just disperpersed throughout the hole pod, or are the in the gill (best word i could think for describing it) part of the pod.  I have noticed that these "gills" seem to have black specs on them.


I guess my question is say I were to have quite a few pods and wanted to make a very potent tea, is there a certain part of the dried pod to use, or am I better off just crushing up the whole thing.


Excuse my ignorance with the terminology; any help/suggestions is appreciated.

I merged your post with this thread


The alkaloids are most concentrated in the the pod walls , but  i think there will hardly be a difference from the crown to the knob (top thingy above the "gills" is the crown) in fact the stem has a similar potency for up to 3 inches below the knob.


So if you want to make stronger tea use more pods and boil your tea down to get it more concentrated if you dont want to drink more.

TY for this & Pssst.  Can't wait til I'm Blue so I can write & return PM's.


Here's what not to do:  take remaining crowns & knuckles, grind & mix with maple flavor shredded wheat.  A bowl of mush impossible to get down.  Even if liquified again - still too thick & worse than probably would have been w/o the wheat.

I used to do the whole t-shirt steep method. I then realized that eating the grounds works way better, uses a lot less, and actually less disgusting too.


I just mix the ground with a little bit of water until they are kind of suspended, chug it down, and chase it with juice.

**Withdrawal?  Something Else?**


I'm new to poppy tea and have a very low opiate tolerance.  I had a few glasses over the course of a week last week, each time 2-3 pods included, with one day between each use.  I took 2 days in a row off for the first time since starting and, on the 2nd night, had the most horrid nightmare of my life and woke up with gnawing stomach pain, cold and sweaty, and feeling like I was "going insane".  


My question is, how long does tea take to get out of your system?  And are mild withdrawals a possibility after only 4 days of use?  I also felt a UTI coming on last nite and took 2 Cystex on an empty stomach, which is the only other thing I did differently that might have caused this.  I know tea can be very addictive and have resolved to use it no more than 3 days a week, so no lectures on addiction are needed...I was just curious as to whether I need to be prepared for more of this in the future.  Thanks!

If you have been addicted to opiates before , Wd's are very much possible after 4 days of use , more so with poppy tea since it lasts so long , with 4 days of use the opiates might stay in your body for 1 week .


imo 3 times a week is too much to avoid withdrawals  , 2x a week would be possible , spaced out as far as possible.


P.S im merging this into the mega-poppy tea thread

I've never been addicted before, and have always kept my use to nothing stronger than one hydrocodone 10mg., 2x daily with months in between uses.  


I figured 3x a week would be pushing it, but felt it was better to be realistic and stick to a schedule than just end up using daily like I did with pills.  


Thanks for the info!

on another topic, anyone know anything about golden ovals?  read somewhere that the pods in golden triangle (familiar from H found in NY during Viet fiasco) were oval shaped.  would these be related?

weird - had a really hard time getting here today.  had to use my history to find it.  is something happening with this thread? or is the search function just acting funky?  then again, the link I tried didn't work either (which led me to search).


i notice there haven't been any new posts for a couple of days.  


just being paranoid?

**Opium (homemade) & Pod Tea not working as I expected**


I've stoped methadone and ALL opiate/opioid use for 2 months- 2 months and a half. My poppies just grew in. 

The opium:

First of all I used the latex from a couple of pods except after drying it out I got at the most 0.1g of *raw* opium (i hear that *smokable/comercial* opium is boiled in water to be refined further). Anyways I put this in a pipe with weed on the bottom and on top of mabye 1/3 of that piece and I felt a nice taste to it, while it didn't get me high like a hard narcotic such as fentanyl/oxycodone/codeine, it could definatley feel something very smooth and quite nice, though definatley nothing strong. 


The pods: 

The second thing I did was I took a bunch of small, small poppy pods that I couldn't use sine they were so small I had to struggle to make an incision. So by the time I picked them they were already pretty much dry. I left them an hour or two and made tea with them....about 20 very small pods with stems as well. However I didn't crush them up to a powder (I only have a coffee grinder and it's not that good, while it would cut them much better I still could only get a little poweder and not everything turned to poweder). I left them on low for about 15-20min with enough water to cover them up, a shot glass of lemon juice (freshly squeezed) and ocasionally stirring them until boilling, at which point I took them of the stove and covered the pot up with a plate for infusion. I let it infuse for around 20-30min, after which I poured it thourgh a screen, sqeezed the remains and added a 2 tea spoons of honey. I drank all of it within a 30min period...I didn't feel a single thing (I also took Tylenol 3, along with Clonazepam and Cannabis). I was expecting a whole lot more from that tea. I did however split open the pod heads and after emptying out the seeds split them in a couple pieces, if that counts. 


I know how to make tea, I make a lot of different teas.


***There are two most commonly used methods: 

1. You heat the water up and *then* thrown in your plants and herbs and cover it up with a plate or something for infusion, OR, 

2. You put your herbs and plants in a pot filled with water and have it put on low/medium until it starts to boil; once it boils you remove it and cover it with a plate or something for infusion.

P.S. I also add a shot or so of lemon or lime to the water in the case of pods. ***


The colour of the tea water was light brown/brownish (wich I hear I a good indicator of potency). 


As I said I have no tolerence anymore to narcotics and 2-3 Tylenol 3's at once with a puff or two of cannabis puts me basically in a nod. 


**Which method do you usually use when it comes to pod tea? **


**Can anybody tell me what I did wrong with:


1: The opium- 

Is it supposed to be stronger than I described it?


2: The pods: -

Should they be *completly* dry? (till the stems crackle), and also: Should the pods/stems be *compeltley* grinded up to a *powder* or can you just cut the up in small enough pieces (not to be considred a powder)?**

pods need to be powder.


yes, it's supposed to be stronger than that.  you still have a tolerance, and raw opium is unlikely to be very powerful (especially just .1g).


you also don't smoke opium on weed.

The reason your pods were so weak is that you picked them when they were dry which is too late ,half  of the alkaloids will be gone ,  te made from  small bits works but powdered material is even better , if you get fresh pods don't dry them they lose potency when dried , so green pods are better.


and as hamilton stated don't smoke raw opium and especially not on weed , better to just make tea.

How is it bad to smoke raw opium? Especially in comparison to tea (considering that its mostly all morphine and codeine), the oral bioavialability would suck compared to smoked. 


As well I was skeptical of smoking raw opium at first as well, but I found out from research that many people do smoke raw opium, the most famous being the Hmong (sp) of Laos with a long tradition of smoking it like such. 


**How should you smoke opium if not in a pipe covered with cannabis and with cannabis on the bottom of the pipe as well (with the raw opium in between). **

**Poppy Tea.. how to make it taste good?**


Just like the title says.  I know most people prefer just to make the tea, and then chase it with something sweet.  I'm looking for people who actually mixed/made a decent tasting Arnold Palmer type of drink or something.  Pretty much anything to mix with it like lemonade, oj, honey, sugar, etc.  Catchy nicknames are encouraged as well.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


I guess I could have a big taste testing ordeal in the kitchen, however I'd rather hear your valued opinions instead.  Mods, I don't know if you're going to leave it separate from the mega poppy thread, but it is focused ONLY on recipes.  Thanks for any suggestions.

The best way to make the tea taste good is mix it with some powdered lemonade, stir, and add sugar. Also add an umbrella to give it that festive edge. If you put in enough lemonade mix, you won't even taste it.


Have you ever tried to boil down the water to a sludge, dry it, and then smoke it on some good green? You have you use alot of poppy straw but if you do it right it works great-----especially on top of some hydrocodone.

There are traditional Chinese opium pipes, which have a very small bowl and a long thin vertical stem...im not sure about some kind of screenage...but you could google it and try to fashion one, or they sell such things at pipe shops, usually metal methinks. 


I had the same result smoking it on buds, and it heavily resinated my pipe (not bad but I wanted to inhale that stuff all at once), tried a tinfoil and a straw, 'chasing the dragon', but ended up burning it and felt like a crack head. 

If I had bothered to gather more instead of just using the pods, I would have maybe used a candle for steady heat instead of a lighter, as to not burn the opium. 


I ground up a few pods into very fine powder last night, mixed it with strawberry milk, and downed; not so bad, seemed to do the trick, I slept which was what I was aiming for. 

I have quite a tolerance too though.

Thanks for the quick response man.  I have not tried to boil it down to a sludge, but my buddy was asking about a good way to do it, and I'll pass that along about the weed and 'codone.  I'm just not a big fan of smoking, but that lemonade sounds like a good plan.  I appreciate the advice, anyone else?

There's no way to make potent poppy tea actually taste *good*, but in my experience you can make it taste less like taint sweat by adding sugar, honey, and/or lemon juice.

Why don't you just add honey/sugar and milk? I've done this with my kratom and it always masks the taste well. Give it a try!

It's really not worth attempting to make poppy tea taste good. One step you could take is to evaporate the tea and make it highly concentrated so you can get it down in a few sips. You'd lose some this way, but if you can't handle the taste, you can make pod putty, put it in gel caps and not even taste it. Adding flavors to diluted tea might make it taste different, but there's nothing you can add to make it taste good IMHO. I'd always just rather get it over with in one quick drink with a chaser.

Adding anything makes it taste worse imo , the best way to drink it is cold so you can chug it

**ORANGE JUICE **and **APPLE JUICE** are the only two things i can tolerate with pod tea or pod grounds. My 3rd choice would be **Hawaiian punch]** or any sort of punch. But the punch makes it taste like Hydrocodone cough syrup lol. I'm serious! Although, back when i loved Hydrocodone, I LOVED taste of hydro cough syrup because i knew it was going to make me high. But, now i hate hydrocodone in any form because i developed an allergy to it. Boy, i used to love me some Hydrocodone cough syrup, otherwise known as Hycodan. I never tried Tussinex, does it taste the same? TussX is the 10mg right? Hycodan is the 5mg? *  Ok, i am digressing here... sorry... Back to the topic on hand.

*

The reason i like Apple juice the most is because apple juice is very sweet and it covers that fowl *sawdust taste.* But, the reason i like orange juice is because the flavor is so strong (the orange flavor) i can actually chug it down and all i taste is the orange, unless i stop than I'll taste nastiness. I have to keep chugin' and swallowing... and all i taste is orange. Actually i may even like the orange juice route better because i can drink it a lot faster and get it over with.


With apple juice i can't chug and swallow, i have to drink it sowly and in between sips I'm sure i make the most ugliest face while shaking my head in    pure distaste. But, the apple flavor really sweetens it good.


Now for Poppy seed tea (the above was for pod tea/pod gronds) i only put lemon in it. Strangely Poppy seed tea doesn't taste bad to me at all, i just chug and swallow with no problems-- i add no flavoring but real lemon juice and it's just a spoonful of it but i can drink it alone as well.


Oh and actually Pod tea i can drink with nothing in it. The apple juice and orange juice i only use for drinking pod grounds. *I Forgot to clarify that above.

*

I knew what you meant roxi.  Besides lemonade, oj was my next leading canidate.  I know everyone just says to chug it and chase with something, but I appreciate all the mixed drink ideas.   I'm going to try all the above mentioned plus the gelcaps once I master the putty route...baking and all that shit

Seems also that (strong) coffee works well, better if the raw grounds are added than the tea.  Not terrible either way.


Also read online of someone who makes, what she calls, "Poppy Biscuits".  She basically boils the pods down to a thick mush,  drops small amounts (pill size) on a cookie sheet, or something like it, and then freezes them.  She has to swallow a bunch of these frozen thangs one by one.  Says it's tedious but she doesn't ever have to taste it.  Sounds a bit labor intensive to me, but if you're interested, you can probably do a search for it.  I think you'll find it on poppies.org, but can't swear to it.

Why would you lose anything? In reference to the [MSDS](http://bulkpharm.mallinckrodt.com/_attachments/msds/MORIN.htm) I posted from Mallinckrodt, morhpine's melting point is almost 400F.

Every once in a while you'll get this.  It is a mold.  


I've used them with no ill effects.....

> **ORANGE JUICE **and **APPLE JUICE** are the only two things i can tolerate with pod tea or pod grounds. My 3rd choice would be **Hawaiian punch]** or any sort of punch. But the punch makes it taste like Hydrocodone cough syrup lol. I'm serious! Although, back when i loved Hydrocodone, I LOVED taste of hydro cough syrup because i knew it was going to make me high. But, now i hate hydrocodone in any form because i developed an allergy to it. Boy, i used to love me some Hydrocodone cough syrup, otherwise known as Hycodan. I never tried Tussinex, does it taste the same? TussX is the 10mg right? Hycodan is the 5mg? *  Ok, i am digressing here... sorry... Back to the topic on hand.

You use to be on Hydrocodone and grew an allergy to it?????  Oh my GOD!  Did  anyone else notice something???? If you have an allergy from Hydrocodone, th odds are you would have a reaction to Oxycodone.  I have never met someone who all of a sudden gets a reaction from a drug.  If you really did have an allergy, you would have not been able to take the medicine at all after your first dose of it.  Telling your Doctor you are allergic to Hydrocodone, is a great trick in the world of addiction.  It appears all addicts are allergic to Hydrocodone and Darvocet.  Your Doc. must be an idiot if he really believes all of these lies you tell him.  Those are all tricks from addicts. Sorry to say!

I've been drinking pod tea on and off for the past few days and absolutely love it except for one thing:  it makes my eyes swell up.  They get red, gooey, and so cloudy I can't see out of them.  Then the next day, the lids are so swollen it's ridiculous.  I've heard of the histamine thing, but I don't itch at ALL from any opiates, which is weird.


I can't really take antihistamines before the tea, as they make me go directly to sleep.  I do take Claritin-D beforehand and have been taking benadryl at night...any suggestions?

Have only had seed tea....feels like a shot of morphine to me. (used to be a nurse)   Lookin for some good pods though.  I shake the seeds in a bottle with warm water and grape juice.  Seems to work well.  long lasting buzz.  think pods are better?  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Or anyone try rinsing seeds twice trying for a second buzz the next day?  Seems they might have everything rinsed off, but just wondering.....

Just brewed up my first batch of PPT. I got my shipment of Mammoth pods and took a handfull and cut the stems out and took the seeds out. Than messured out 35g using my scale. Took the pods and threw them in my blender and broke em up till they were a pretty small size. Took the powder and threw it into a martini (drink mixer I dont know the name it the metal ones with the cap and strainer on it). Than I heated 3cups of water to an almost boil. and added into the drink mixer and stired up and let sit for 30minutes. Than threw the lid on the drink mixer and strained into a container using a funnel and a tshirt as secondary strainer (the drink mixer got the bigger chunks of pod left in its strainer)


I drank 1/4 and waiter a lil bit than drank another 1/4 and I am nice and opiated. This shit is amazing I didnt think Id be this high and it was only half the drink I have some left for later...YAY for PPT

So can anyone verify the calcium carbonate method? Per 15 grams of crushed up pod material how much calcium carbonate would be required? Is caclium morphenate active in the human body?


I am looking for a surefire way too extract morph from dried pods, purify it enough so it can be injected.

**Seeds**


I've read whole thread...


Ok, at first:

**How much seeds should I use?** 500-700g would be alright? I have no tolerance nor have I ever felt anything even mild-strong from codeine (used it about 7 times in doses 150-400mg).


Ok, now the "extraction" method:


I've read about these 3:


1.

a) Heat up 2 liters of water - **what temperature would be optimal?**

b) add the seeds

c) add lemon -** how many lemons do you recommend to use?**

d) stir for 3 minutes

c) leave and stir from time to time - **how long should I wait?**

d) separate the seeds from the solution with t-shirt


2.

Differs with using a bottle and shaking it instead of stirring - I think there's not much difference compared to the method above ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**For how long should I shake or/and leave it before separating seeds and the rest?**


3.

Differs with using cold water and leaving the whole thing for 24 hours


**Which one to use?**


And other stuff:

I'll use grapefruit juice, 1 liter the day before, and 1 at the 0 day

**Can I use both diphenhydramine and DXM?**

**In what quantities?**


To avoid this question:

In Poland possession of pods is (AFAIK) illegal, and the poppy that grows wild is probably low on morphine


Thx for all constructive replies

Hey guys Ive been enjoying pod tea for a while now. But tonight I have no pods but a ton of leftover stems and crowns? About how much material do I need to get the same effect as say...4 to 6 one inch diameter pods?? In other words, just how much weaker are the stems and crowns?

The stems are substantially weaker than the pods. The crowns on the other hand can be suprisingly potent, I would certainly put them to use. I always save the crowns so if I run out of pods, I have a safety.


If I were you, I would use the stems and the crowns. Even though the stems are less potent and tend to lend a shitty taste, they still contain alkaloids. 


It's hard to say give equivalents since pods very so much in potency...wish I could give you a better answer for that.

**In my opinion your making it way to complicated.   I'd start with 500 mg, use some type of funnel to put the seeds in a large plastic bottle, (like a juice bottle).  Add warm water until about 2 inches above seeds (i usually add maybe 3 crushed Vitamin C's too), shake for 2 minutes, let sit for 5 min., shake again and strain.  You can add juice instead of Vit C.   Don't let sit too long.  YOu don't need to heat it up, works just great straight from the faucet**

Hey folk - I've got two questions today.  Anyone know the relative potency of different varieties of dried pods, i.e. Arizona, Gigantheum, Tasmanian, Turk, Dutch, etc.; and which do you feel is most potent?


Secondly, about fresh poppies --  have any idea of what 50 smallish pods would yield in opium?  And, is it worth it, or they better be used for tea?

Day one, I only drank the tea.  Still felt a niiice buzz for hours.  However, day two I drank the tea, then ate the grounds and wow.  I was literally high for 24 hours it seemed like, and just as, if not more intense.  I found the best thing to mix with it is some Yoplait yogurt.  It just tasted like granola in the yogurt, cept it was a little bitter...but that's good!!

Get a coffee bean grinder, get the cheapest one you can find.


Remove the "knuckles" and stem from the pod, empty the seeds out. Now just crush the pod and crown in your hand into the grinder, now grind well until it has the consistency of powder. Now you can mix it with water or yogurt or whatever, just take it. Works best on an empty stomach. 


BTW I find it better taste wise to mix it with a small amount of water and just take it like a vodka shot then drink some sweet juice or soda, works better then mixing with a large amount of drink.

well my 0.02 for the mega thread.


for those who use PST, a good method to avoid the terrible bitterness is to:


1 hyperhentilate (5-10 seconds)

2 take a deep breath and plug your nose

3 chug the tea

4 with nose still plugged chew 1 or 2 vitamin C tablets and chase with orange juice, be sure to swish it around in your mouth a bit.

5 unplug your nostrils and you should have not the slightest bitter after-taste.

**On Poppies.**


So, in an... area, more or less in the immediate vicinity to myself, there are some poppies growing. Normally of course I'd not take a huge interest in that, but these flowers are now accompanied by twenty to thirty pods. My motivations here are purely about the local children. Is there an easy way to tell if these poppies are dangerous and harbouring an opium content? The pods at this moment aren't ripe, the flowers still have their petals and the crowns are stiff and quite horizontal, I did score a smaller pod and it leaked a small amount of white pus. Is this watery opium? There were seeds inside, little white and tan seeds. 


I'm aware somniferum usually ripens in Autumn and drops it's seeds then too. This being the end of summer, it would seem fitting that growing pods would be about. Would it be safe to assume that I'm dealing with Papaver somniferum? Do all poppies have pods? I've checked through erowid and the various threads here, and I'm still not quite sure what I'm dealing with.


Many thanks, and *please*, think of the children. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Cut them. 

If they leak that white stuff its probably Papaver somniferum. The way your describing them it sound like it. I doubt that the kids in your neighborhood would know what it was if they seen it, but you never know in todays world.

Cheers, I'm quite confident I am dealing with Papaver somniferum, but am still a little apprehensive. Would there be any harmful effects if one of those, erm, children, were to go about collecting the "opium" and it ended up simply being generic poppy sap?


Also, just so I can be a little more clued in as to what these children might be doing, do any opiate users here have any preferences of what to do with pods? Scrape the opium? Make tea? Goodness, it almost sounds like I'm looking for advice. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yes, but one should be careful because scraping the pods = jailtime. The pods are not illegal to grow or sell but it's illegal to make tea or score them to collect opium.  


and to answer a question, poppy tea can be made out of the pods easily. I heard it doesnt matter if they are green or dried..

My God. You people act like this stuff tastes like cat crap or something. 

Personally, I don't find it that repugnant. I add a little instant coffee to the tea, and it actually tastes pretty good to me. Never have I mixed up a batch that tasted as foul as what you guys are afraid of. If you can't staomach the stuff, why don't you move on to something else. Something that won't offend your delicate senses. JMO

I haven't read through this thread in a couple months, but I don't recall any mention of capping ground pods.  I recently bought a couple hundred pods and went through the trouble of preparing about 1400 capsules, since I couldn't stomach the tea more than ~20 times.  I know, that sounds completely insane, but it didn't take too long with a Cap-M-Quik, and it isn't too impractical if you have no tolerance or take a potentiator (I take nortriptyline daily as chronic migraine treatment), or both, as was my case.


The GI effects are about the same, but obviously since you're ingesting all of the pods rather than just what you brewed from them, it's quite a bit more potent by weight, if not in terms of effects.

I suggest the tried and true parachute technique.  


Grind pods in a coffee grinder, after removing the seeds.  Then proceed as you would parachuting anything else.  It may take 3-9 "parachutes" (tolerance  

pending) to down it all, but it's the easiest and most tasteless manner to consume the goods.


I work at a healthfood store whee capsules are sold, and they're a major waste of cash when toilet paper works just as well (with a gulp of water) especially considering how much more fits in a "parachute" VS a 00 Capsule.

I'd rather put 10+ nice, fully self-contained capsules than sheets of toilet paper.  If you look hard enough, you can find 1000-packs of OO caps for $12 online, couple more if you want veggie.  I recall Whole Foods having 500-packs of veggie caps for around $22.  Considering a couple dozen a day are eaten if you're going all-out, it'll save a lot of time if you just pop caps.

If they look like this, it's opium.


You're better off just eating the whole pods instead of trying to extract opium. You need to score about 100 pods just to get enough to smoke. I had a similar situation to yours, someone in my neighborhood was growing them for decoration. I got the best effects from just munching 10-15 pods at a time.

agree with the coffee route - one cup brewed with two measures of coffee masked product of 8 pods (37g, in this case)

answered my own question on the DEA site, which does give incredible instructions on havesting O - accourding to them, in Vietnam they get approx. .08g/poppy (making 50=4g.  doubt anything cultivated more locally will result in the same, however.)  Will probably use 10 for tea.


still nobody out there with an opinion on the best, most potent, PS variety?

That's them. So apparantly it's good to grind them up in a coffee grinder and then mix them with yoghurt or something, or do you eat them whole?

I just chop the top off, slice the pod into quarters, and chew it up each piece real good and swallow. You can empty the seeds into your mouth beforehand if you like (they taste good.) Be warned; the morphine and codeine make it taste EXTREMELY bitter, but you get used to it after a couple mouthfulls. I prefer this method over making tea because you get 100% of the morphine and codeine in each pod. However, the effects can last up to 12 hours because a lot of the alkaloids are tied up in the plant's cellulose, giving it an extended-release quality. I would typically eat 10-15 pods to catch a good nod, but you should start off with maybe 5 at first because the potency can vary quite a bit from batch to batch.


Enjoy!

Should the outside of the pods be washed first? Thanks for the info, though. I'm an occaisonal messer with codeine - it's cheap and easy to get, but I know these'll be a lot stronger. Also, should they be eaten fresh or what's the deal with that? Do you know a way to keep them fresh if they've been picked and not eaten at that specific time?

just rinse 'em with tap water. keep them in the refridgerator if you want to keep them from drying out and getting rubbery. i usually just eat 'em fresh, right off the plant. trust me, it works. just start with a couple at first, 'cause I nearly OD'ed when I ate 20 at once.

Uh you don't need 100 pods to get enough opium to smoke. Each pod should give you 50mg to 100mg of opium (5mg to 20mg of morphine). I can feel that when taken orally, so I know it's perfectly fine for smoking. If it took 10 pods orally to get you nodding, smoking the opium from 2 or 3 should have done the same thing to you.

^^if you know what you're doing you can probably get more opium with less pods. I was using a pocketknife, scoring vertically, and I only got a miniscule amount of opium from each pod. It took scoring about 50 pods to get less than half a gram.

You're supposed to score them horizontally. It does take a lot to get a decent amount of opium, but for personal use it may be feasible. However, eating the pods or doing tea probably is your best bet. 


Opium and heroin and morphine base and the like are used because they are easier to smuggle and more 'commercial' in many ways.

Well, opium alkaloids are pretty crap when taken orally.


IV/smoking is the way to go. It's always worth harvesting and/or processing your poppy pods.

^ I've taken a large pea sized amount of opium before and I enjoyed it. Even more mellow and relaxing than smoking it, I don't regret eating it, but smoking it is better. Solely because of that heavenly smell.

Do not IV opium, that is a terrible idea. It can be done but it just does ridiculous damage, it's pretty well documented in eastern europe of people shooting opium after wars and whatnot.


Eating the pods is your best bet, but you can try your hand at smoking the opium if you want to.

when i eat the ground pods, i just place under my tounge- then have a sip of my fruit juice and swallow. the sweetness of the juice masks the bitterness for myself


oh ya and when i am desperate i just eat the damn pod. I get to pick up my pods since my seller lives in the same city. When i order too late and am sick getting them, i HAVE to eat them on the bus. i just cant sit there holding the pods- 2.5 hour ride home. anyways 


SO i just break each pod open and munch on them like chips lol. people look at me like wtf is he eating but i dont care. so if you see a guy on the bus munching on his pods say hi lol

Thanks. Has anyone any pictures of the sort of horizontal scores needed? Are we talking hundreds of little nicks all around these things, or just perhaps scoring the bottom of the pods and waiting for the sap to bleed? How long does that take, too?


Also, can you eat the pods at any time or is it best to leave them until the petals are off the flowers?

The bunch of them growing isn't really in abundance.

Man that's brutal!!  I know they probably don't taste that bad, but my gag reflex would almost choke me just from knowing what I was chomping down on.  With a tea, it's over quickly, but all that chewing would do me in!!  But all power to you if you can do it!!

One pretty wide score, maybe like 1-2 inches. Horizontally. Only go about 1-2mm deep, you don't want to scratch past that outer skin. You just let it drip out, it should take around 30 minutes.


I'm not exactly sure when is the best time to eat them. I'd imagine right when the pods ripen and the seeds have just matured.


You're best bet is to eat them buddy. Opium is pretty inefficient when you don't have that much, it's only done when you can get tons of opium pods for cheap and need to be worried about smuggling and weight issues. A lot of the black market involves trucking scams, so weight is a big deal.


My point is that eat them if you want to get the best bang for your buck. Unless you want to smuggle them across a border and size is an issue...

**What is the shelf life of dried poppy pods?**


In other words, how long can you keep dried poppy pods until they go bad, and what signs would indicate that the pods are going bad (mold, for example)? Thanks.

I believe they're schedules in the US, but not wholly enforced. In the UK they're completely legal to grow.


So, anyway, I went out this morning and plenty of them were ripe. I've got about five here, following the recommended beginner's dosage, and am slowly eating them up. I'll post a trip report when today's over to tell you all how it went. Busy day today too, I just hope I don't dilate too much.

Some guy had almost exactly same experience with 50 "fresh" small pods he received -- except only a bit over half were at their prime.  He slit those vertically with paring knife.  Ended up with less than g of O, but doesn't have scale measuring less than g's.  Very small amount.  Only one or two cuts of each pod yielded anything (don't know if this is normal - according to harvesting reports, in Vietnam, and other eastern areas, they use three-pronged tool).  The rest were soft whiteish, and oozed nada.   


Out of curiosity, I'm wondering:


Are the ones that are scored - still good for anything?


Are the soft ones, which have now been cut & frozen good for tea? or better for eating?


Of the bit of O gathered is it best he eat "as is"?

I just did a 7 month "binge" taking pods every single day. I quit a week ago because it just ended up costing too much money. I've experimented with different ways to take it. The best one IMO is grinding the pods to a very fine powder, mixing them with some water and chugging down the disgusting mess...powder and all. I don't know that many people can stomach this...I have an incredibly strong stomach and almost puked a few times. If you can keep it down, you will get about twice as high as you would from making tea out of the same amount of pods. The first time I did it, I was fucked HARD. I scaled back the dose and it worked fine. 


To anyone thinking about pods...it's certainly just as hardcore as things like heroin or oxy. It will get you very addicted. The withdrawal seems to have more of a depression element than other opiates. Oxy withdrawal made me cold and achey. Poppy withdrawal made me feel like life was hopeless. Bad shit. Pretty intense RLS too.

ok, listen up guyys-

ima write a bit about harvesting from live opium plants.

i have done this thousands of times.


Scoring:

The amount of opium obtained will depend on these things:

CLIMATE - depending on the growing conditions, they will be bountiful, or bare. fresh rain while budding up, then strong sunshine when flowering is best.

MATURITY - when the crown atop the pod is flat out, the pods can be harvested. most potent opium is obtained, when the crowns are curling upwards. eventually the pod overripens, and will produce no more opium. then, the opium inside will not ooze out. it will dry, inside the pod.

WEATHER - as you cut the pods, and the opium oozes out, if the sun is too strong, and the air dry, the opium will dry very quickly, blocking the cut, and stemming the flow. England produces the best situation: the sun is strong, so the opium does dry, but the air is not too hot and dry, so the opium is still soft, allowing more to push out slowly, and meaning your O does not CRUST onto the pod, which sucks arse, because it all flicks away when you scrape it.


Now, the method:

multiple harvests are possible, to a degree, dependant upon the growing conditions.

i begin to harvest when the crown is flat, leaving 3-4days before scoring the same pod again, repeating until no more opium flows.

to begin, use a pin.

take some pliers and bend the tip, 1mm of it, perpendicular to the shaft.

this will allow you to make even scores.

it is easy to fuck up with a razor blade.

The scores should be around 1mm in depth.

They must breach the surface, enough that opium oozes out,

but not so much that they penetrate the entire outside layer.

If the cut is too deep, i.e. the inner chamber is pierced,

opium will be lost to the internal cavity of the pod, and pressure will not force much opium onto the surface.

This sucks arse, is inefficient and makes you look like an amateur.

practice with razor blades on tiny pods, or exhausted pods.

it is good to master the blade.

the blade produces (as anyone who has done time in one of the nastier institutions will know) a very clean cut, which takes long to heal.

This allows more opium to flow out, before the slit clogs up.

Plus, it makes you look like a pro.

Paperclip, one guy told me.

moron. his pods looked like they'd been massacred by a mad lumberjack.


in my climate, 3 slits is generally ideal.

too few, and less opium will be able to escape.

too many, and the lack of pressure will produce tiny beads of opium, which will dry quickly and hard, sealing the cut, and proving difficult to harvest.

THREE SLICES,

DIAGONALLY, TOP TO BOTTOM,

APPROX. 5mm APART.

hint:

i go, top-left, to bottom right, across (and round, and down) the pod.

it is a LONG cut, be careful.

the direction is ideal for harvest, the opposite sweep, back up.

slit in the direction you find easiest  to harvest.

if the pods are eye level, slit horizontally,

when you harvest, you will scrape the edge of the blade forwards, along the scores.

moving perpendicularly to the direction of the scores.

this is important, if you attempt to scrape, with the razor aligned parallel to the scores, it will catch in the groove, snag, flick and send your flake opium flying away.

This sucks, and you look like an amateur.


Harvesting:

Leave your scored pods for between 8-24 hours, before returning,

depending on the weather.

regardless, any time, any weather will be "okay" (save immediate torrential rain),

but there are ideals.

if it is intensely hot, 6-8hours should be ok. longer will dry it out too much, and it will "flick" and be difficult to harvest.

if it is damp, if it rains, or if it is cool, leave for longer.

The ideal time is when the Opium is light brown all through, firm, but soft; 

not runny.

Intuitive estimates will come from experience.

Some intelligence is required.


Technique; as said previously, scrape a blade in the opposite direction to when you scored it, back along the scores (upwards), 

with the blade perpendicular to the scores (and, so, to the direction of motion).

push gently onto the pod, so as to not pull off the O, but to push it upwards, letting it stick onto your blade.

it's easy when you do it right.

i find a 10 rouble note to be good to store it in (waxy layer to scrape from),

but there will be better surfaces.

Others i have used have been greaseproof sweet- wraps.


finally:

**pods that do not produce any opium when sliced, or those that have been exhausted, may be sliced completely free, to be used in a tea.**

This is the best use for those pods, which you may have unfortunately have cut "too deep".


...

Take heed of my wisdom, and you shall surely {get real fucking high} in a most dignified and efficient manner.

please, feel free to present one of any of your inevitable questions, to propose any hypothesis, or to dither along any discourse, which may, subsequently, occur to you.

My (now) Sangria-soaked brain is for your pickings.


Oh yeah and don't use poppy seed tea.

good luck.

diche, dried poppy pod flesh contains just as much morphine and codeine as opium, on a pod by pod basis. (not based on dry weight of pods vs. opium)


You can nod off of pod tea every bit as well as you can from pure heroin.

Would this also work for pods that arrived (talking about those not homegrown, but shipped) too old to produce liquid (texture being white & rubbery)?


Also, is it true that they should frozen before grinding for tea?


thx for all the info

The withdrawal seems to have more of a depression element than other opiates. Oxy withdrawal made me cold and achey. Poppy withdrawal made me feel like life was hopeless. Bad shit. Pretty intense RLS too.

Well as addictive as a equal amount of ORAL heroin or oxy, sure. Please don't start claiming a couple of pods a day is more addictive then IV heroin as some have, thats just nonsense.


I find the WD is less intense but much. longer lasting.


You don't want to start doing this daily unless you are ready for dependence.

heh i found hundreds (maybe 1k+) this year =P


took me some time to use it up.

i dont get addicted, because i don't use out of season.


and dezyna yes, you can use them.

if youre going to grind them well, don't freeze, no point.

if you do want to freeze, do it when they are moist, or the ice crystals wont be there to pierce the cell membranes.

Ya know, I havent been feeling this stuff that much, im even eating the grounds and not bothering to make a tea out of it. It may be my tolerance but I never seem to get much more than an abatement of WD's from up to 14g eaten. Haven't felt right taking more than that from our dwindling bucket of pods, and only every few days or so.


Anyone know if SSRI's, specifically sertraline blocks some of the opiate effect? I rarely get what I would consider 'euphoria', unless you count the euphoria of being able to walk around without as much pain, without shits, and basically not feeling like I cant leave my bed. Anyone's experience??

With a basic alcohol extraction on both pods and the seeds in the pods, this method works flawlessly.  One thing ive noticed today, coating maybe a 1/3 or 1/4 of a cigarette with it works well, almost as well as dipping the fingerprint of your index finger and coating the bottom of your tongue.

Morphine content in pods is only usually like 0.15% (to 0.30%), so 14 x 0.0015 = 2mg... or 4mg at most. No wonder you didn't feel anything. If you eat the grounds, it's going to be absorbed much slower than if you drink it in tea form.


14g isn't even a single pod, is it?

Sertraline will make codeine not work so well; it prevents metabolism into morphine.


Maybe you just have low-alkaloid content pods?

I'll make this quick.


When you get your dried pods - be it 500g, a kilo or more, do the following...


i. Take X number/grams of pods (whatever it takes to get you nodding or similar) and grind them up as fine as possible. Heat water to 80 centigrade (using a kettle, just keep an eye and guesstimate). Put powder in 1 litre pyrex jug, add hot water, stir and microwave at 700W for 26 minutes.


<thats not the point of this post - feel free to use whatever method you prefer>


ii. Take three large freezer bags and sort the remaining pods using the following criteria:-


a. Colour (yellower *generally* the better*)

b. Shake (A high pitched shake = healthy blue seeds inside)

c. Crack/Crease (If its firm then great but if it is squeezy its not so good)


Label the bags 'A', 'B' and leave the other blank. Put the yellowest pods, with the high-pitched, high seed quantity/density and optimum hardness (essentially 'crackability' - brisance if you will) in bag A. 


Any pods that are largely blue/purple in colour AND/OR squeezy should be cut in half. If they yield a mixture of predominantly blue seeds and do not have clumps of brown seeds along the vertical 'girder-like' interior pod anatomy, they may go into bag B.


- Throw away any pods with a strong musty/mold-like odour (the 'normal' odour of dried pods is arguably must-esque, so this may require extended exposure to pods in order to properly judge).


- Dark brown/black interiors qualify a pod for the rubbish bag


iii. Now, place the remaining pods into bag B.


iv. Use the best fastener you have to seal bags A & B. Once sealed, place another bag over the first bag and use another fastener to seal this too. Keep in a cool, dark place with a stable humidity and temperature. Use up bag A first before moving onto bag B.


v. If you find yourself in the position where you have exhausted the contents of bags A & B and are unable to purchase more pods for several days, remind yourself that by not sorting the pods, you would have started to consume unfit pods and potentially made yourself ill.


n.b. - this is arguably the dullest post in this thread and no, I am not proud of myself![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It was around 10 small pods (size of a... kumquat?), home-grown, not sure of the variety...they were mostly purple and a few pink I think or maybe a bit mixed (the seeds from last year got mixed...cross breeding?)


Its probobly best that it is a small dose and absorbed slowly, I dont want to be going through more w/d's from these, just trying to taper down onto tramadol. 

But say I wanted a good amount, using that formula (approximately 30 pods = 10 mg) I would have to use well over 200 pods! That sounds like a heroic dose ~ are my poppies really that weak??![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

That seems like certain death.


Not sure exactly how many large pods guy I know used, but he got 35g (talking ground poppy, not morphine) from less than 15 or 20.  Wasn't quite enough for his tolerance - fairly long-term user of H, he'll prolly be trying 50g next.


Hear it depends a lot on variety, too.

Actually, theoretically, freezing might ease the load on the blender's attempt to chop rubbery texture.

**Poppy Pod/putty (quick question I need answer fast)**


Ok well tomarrow I am planning on brewing up a big batch of pod tea using less water than normal I usally just cover the pod powder than cover it again. This time I just plan to cover it and maybe add a little bit more water for evaporation and such.


Now that this is said. After I brew and strain Im going to add the liquid to a pyrex dish and place in my oven at a very low temp. What is the highest temp do you think I should I use?


Ill post a picture of the finished product to show you guys.

The melting point of morphine is 392F, so I would recommend a temp of 300F-350F. I would imagine most other alkaloids would have a similar melting point.

just made a good batch of poppy pod tea.  heres what i put in it and it didnt taste  bad at all.


I used one bag of honey tea and one bag of "sleepy time tea" with valerian

Cinnamon Sugar

A little bit of ginger

Lime juice

Honey


I  used it with one and a half cups of water and about 8 pods small to large.

I also chewed on some cloves before i drank it because i was planning on it tasting really bad.  I think adding any herbal tea to it will make it taste alot better.

I prefer to make a slightly more concentrated tea (I use 3 golf ball size+ pods) in about 5-6 oz of water so the tea is REALLY dark and bitter then put the tea in ice but strain it out (like a martini, to chill it instantly) and then dilute it with lemonade so its about 30-40% poppy tea and 60-70% lemonade. Finally I add 1-2 TBSP of sugar and it no longer tastes gross to me. I call it an Arnold Poppy.

Well I did it and I have some pics of my outcome its smokeable too. I didnt smoke any but my buddy who I made it for enjoyed it, and again using a coffee machine is a life safer for making tea. I grind my pods ahead of time now spent hours today and now I just add a filter add how much pods I want add water and let it go. Than run it through again. 2 times seems to be fine.

DAmn man, that sounds pretty good to me.  Kinda makes me think about Poppy pod shots, like shots of wheatgrass...just get it really concentrated.

Oh, and catchy drink name as well![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

**Another Oven Idea**


my fictional character was thinking of simmering bunch of ground pods in soy milk (hoping this doesn't have any negative effect) in a slow cooker, then mixing with canned pumpkin, spices & egg and baking at 275 - 300 until somewhat like pumpkin pie consistency.


he's hoping for an happy dessert that lasts a couple of days (but might just end up with awful tasting pumpkin pie w/no crust).


any thoughts on this?


will let ya'll in on his results.

It took a while to bake but you have to check evry few minutes to make sure its ok. So prob about 45minutes total.


But man the coffee machine for making pod tea is awesome. Its quick, not messy and I can just set it and sit down and chill out. Im starting to feel good from the bit I drank a lil bit ago. Like 40g or so will make under 2 cups with a full resovour after running it through twice. But its real dark and potent.

I've been breaking up my poppy pods with my hands and then making the tea this way. How much less potent would the resulting tea be than if I made it by grinding the pods in a coffee grinder? I've just purchased a coffee grinder and need to know how to adjust the dose. I was using 500g per dose of tea.

**Wild poppies (ones u find rather than grow): How Many Pods Do You Need To Get High?**


This is the season for these things so anyways, I was down to zero tolerence to narcotics when I brewed a tea of about 10 small heads and 5 or so large heads which didn't give me any effects at all...


So what I am wondering is:


**How many pod heads do people need to get high from wild poppies?**


Also:

**

How many pods do people need to get high from commercial pods like Giganteum or Persia White? **

If you really had no tolerance (dont forget if you used a motnh before theere is still  some tolerance) and those were somiferums then they should have gotten you high anywere from a slight buzz to nodding


we can't give you dose advice withut having some more information also the pods vary greatly in potency oh and try using the search engine for a change


ps wild pods are a lot stronger than commercial pods especially when they are fresh and picked at the right time

How much less potent would the tea be from pods of an average potency if you broke the pods up by hand rather than if you ground them up? I need to know how to adjust my dose. I've been using 400-500g of pods.

wow that's a lot of pods


just do a rerun and you will get all the goodies


also when you have big pieces its a good idea to hard  boil for a few minutes

the crown has almost zero opiate content.

the opium is in the membrane of the outer wall of the pod.

So if it is in the membrane of the outer wall, then washing mould off the outside of pods will also wash away a lot of the goods?


Edit, that can't be right. If all the opium is on the outer wall of the pod, then you wouldn't need to grind your pods (you would just have to break them up with your hands). 


Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the majority of the morphine must be contained *within the wall of the pod itself* (not on the inside or outside).

I think you should have given a more nuanced answer , as in roughly half as strong maybe you know , or in my experience 50% but it depends on the way you  prepare your tea too (how long you steep / boil . if you steep long enough your tea will be just as potent no matter how big or small the material is ground)

no, he won't be taking twice as much,

he would be taking HALF as much.

that is, HALF AS MUCH as he previously used.

It WON'T be twice as strong, with the same brewing time.

If he brewed the hand-crushed pods effectively in the first place,

the difference will be small or non-existant.


Also, I did mean INSIDE the outer wall,

but i just meant in THERE,

as opposed to in the crown or the seeds or those little thin fins inside.

I know the top part of the stem contains some alkaloids.

I throw them in too,

but I understand the mechanics of the living plant very well,

and, although there is latex, which will leak out of the stem when cut,

it is much lower in alkaloid content.

The crown will contain trace amounts of alkaloids.

it is practically "dead" in the live plant, anyway.

no opium flows through the crown.

there is never any opium in the crown.

one can break off the crown from a live plant, and no latex will manifest itself.

The latex that manifests itself from a broken stem is very very weak.


Almost all of the opium, 

with almost all (an even greater proportion) of the alkaloids,

is contained within the wall of the pod.

I was saying as a result of your post he will take 2 as much ( as in the idler says its half as strong so im going to double my dose now)


and you might be right on the crown thing


but the first few inches of stem are just as potent as the rest of the pod , and it will bleed the same latex as the pod , if you go too far down it won't bleed and potency is maybe 10-20% of pod material

I'll be drinking my first tea tonight. I have medium to large pods. I'm thinking about using 4 Pods for the tea. I'll post my preparation and effects later on tonight. I have little opioid tollerance, although I had been using those Diluadid last week. Its been a fair amount of time since then. I'm dying for a nod. Those Dilaudid had barely any euphoria/nod. Just leg tingles, even in higher dosage. The pod recipe and effects will show up here later tonight. Hope I have the right dosage for a pod beginner?

"4 medium to large pods" is too vague.


That could weight 10 grams or it could weight 20 grams.


I suppose anywhere from 10-20 grams would be OK for a beginner......but weight is a far superiour denomonation for dosing.

There's too much variation in alkaloid content to give an accurate answer. Start low and work up, remember it can take a while for the pods to kick in.

A lot of people don't have scales capable of weighing grams, I dunno why this question comes up so much. But if you have no opiate tolerance currently just start with a single pod, if you're a regular IV H user start with 2 or 3. No body is going to OD off a single pod no matter how opiate naive they are.


Seriously you can always increase your dose, you might not even like poppies. They are different then single opiates, the stimulation can take some getting used to.

Anti-histamines such as promethazine should stop the nausea. I find all opiates to make it impossible to sleep even if I am very tired/sleepy. Usually I'll fall asleep for 30 seconds and wake up again.

Looks like somniferum to me,but could possibly be orentalis or others.


I have an insane poppy pod tea tolerance.  i drink  it daily or every other day for pain releif.  I have severe neck and back pain from a doctor and am refused pain meds/ect.  any suggestions?  i love poppy tea but would rather get meds from a doctor that will help me manage my pain rather then suffering in silence.  the most they gave me was a shitty musle relaxer... like skelaxin that did nothing whatsoever.  damn doctors. its bullshit how i have to hit the streets to find pain meds and order tea off the net or grow pods rather than have a damn doctor help me.  suggestions?

i'll recommend Turkish White.


Grown with good firm rainfall early on,

then strong hot intense sunshine, from flowering to harvest.


this yields the best opium,

but i just grow all sorts, i like how some of the others look,


spesh the purple-red ones,

which also give reasonably good Opium.

I was just planning on eating a bit a chasing with a drink, but I need to know if I should I go with the same dose for my tea or less. Please reply I need an answer when I wake up.

**English Summer ruins Opium harvest!**


Quite


I can't imagine this weather has helped your crop. I was surprised to learn p. somniferum grow all over the UK - it's even grown under licence in fields near Oxford - if only I knew where that was. Apart from this year do you generally get good yields? Is it worth giving it a go in northern Europe??

If I remember correctly, eating it you need a little less but it doesn't come on quite as fast/hard hitting. Also, it's disgusting. Ate pod grounds once, never again; I prefer to just make tea, then do multiple washes a little later.

You're SOL - those pods are useless.


And no, you can't buy them from the internet. It's illegal and impossible. Even if you could find and order them (which you can't), the package would politely be handed to you to by a DEA agent or two.

^ Eating the pods (according to a few people, a couple pages back) is about twice as strong and twice as long as brewing it into a tea. 

This is the only way I've consumed it the past few times, and found it to be great for keeping W/D's at bay, because the duration and onset are more like methadone. 

Hard to tell if its really twice as strong, but it's all relative to the potency of your pods.

I've wanted to grow poppies for a long time, too. I have grown every other strain of poppy with great results.  Dinner place size flowers of every color, double petal poppies with brilliant pods... I save the pods and dry them upside down to use in dry flower decorations for the christmas tree. I have searched high and low for opium poppies for years now. The government is doing a hell of a fine job keeping them away from folks in the US. The seeds are tiny...I don't have the cajones to go to Turkey or somewhere and get some. I just keep hoping that the universe will send some my way.

No, Red eyed Wonda, the Arizona poppy has no opiate alkaloids. It has soothing effects, but no where near as nice as even the least potent of opiate alkaloids.


Opium producing poppies are legal to grow, possess, and sell. They become illegal as soon as you score them for opium production, or crush them for tea preparation. 

Its not smart to start, if you aren't already addicted to opiates. They're VERY addictive, because they last so long. Its very easy for your body to become dependant on the high they produce.


They are sold over the internet. As of right now, the government trusts the population to use them for decorative purposes. The more talk about opium tea on these forums, the faster this will be banned.

hrmmm so what are exactly the differences between the arizona's and the regular pods, because the ones i had were identical to the regular pods i've got in the past, and identical in effects. maybe the seller mislabed them? idk, but they felt the same as the regular pods i've used before. maybe a little more potent. and i've done a good bit of pods to know the difference, and fucked around with all opiates, except oxymorphone and demerol, i've done 'em all

I, too, get Arizona purples, which are just a strain of P.Somniferum grown and harvested in the state of Arizona.  I've heard that a couple of years ago, Arizona Purples had a really potent harvest, so now there's lots of mislabeled fake "Arizonas" as a marketing ploy...but the ones I've gotten are most certainly opium pods.


There's something called "California Poppy" that is not opium-containing and is just used for its sedative properties, which is listed completely separately from Somniferums on Erowid.  Arizona Purples are P. Somniferum, just like Tazmanians, Turks, Hens and Chicks, etc.  It's just another name used to distinguish them from other vendors' products.


And it's NOT legal (technically) to grow, possess, sell, etc. opium poppies, scored or not.  Poppy "straw" as they call it is a controlled substance.  The only part of the plant that's legal to possess is the seed.  This is a gray area, however, as the law is rarely enforced.  Pods are sold for crafting and culinary purposes so widely and grown for their beauty in so many gardens that there'd be a massive uproar if 70-year old gardeners and crafters like Martha Stewart were busted, and the DEA doesn't want that.  They don't need people questioning their idiot policies more than we already do.  Plus, they're strained budget-wise since 9-11.  That's not to say that someday, if people keep advertising using pods to get high like morons, that they can't or won't start cracking down, because they have every right to...they just aren't right now.

*EDITED* My apologies Red_Eye_Wonda, I knew I messed up, I just couldn't tell where. You said you have Arizona Poppies. Those are just a type of P. Somniferum as Lady Codone has explained above. Sorry, I just get excited and anxious when I get to describe something I have a passion for to someone.  


Perhaps you got Papaver Somniferum pods *from* California? You see the California Poppy is the common name for Eschscholzia Californica. Eschscholzia Californica does not produce opium, or any opiate alkaloids. It has no codeine, no morphine, no nothing. Where-as Papaver Somniferum produces a wide variety of opiates. The California Poppy is often sold in herbal smoking blends as a mild sedative. You can also make a tea from its petals, the most potent part of this poppy. Its very soothing in blends and tea, but nothing compared to opium. 


Its hard to confuse the pods of the California Poppy with Papaver Somniferum. California Poppies have long, almost chili pepper shaped pods. So I highly doubt you could mistake them for P. Somniferum.

You're dead wrong. Yes you can buy pods on the internet. It's not illegal unless you use them for something other than decoration/floral arrangement. Once you consume them or prepare them to be consumed they become illegal. And no, the DEA doesn't take pod packages. 1000's of people order pods and no on ever gets a knock on the door from the DEA. Sometimes the seller gets into trouble though. You are way off with that statement. I'm shocked people actually think that way. If that was the case 10 people i know would be in big trouble right now long with 100o's of others. LOL

I think he was trying to deterr noobies from getting in on the pod "secret" and so should you , if people don't even take the time to do a proper google they are probably the same kind of people who OD on poppy pods and  that will make it illegal/harder to get  for the rest of us (like with the pst )

I do believe **ANY PART**, live or dead, fresh or dried,** of the** **opium poppy plant is ILLEGAL in the United States**, *specifically exempting the seeds,*


However, the dried poppies law was/is rarely enforced, due to their existing prevalence in decorative flower arrangement.


Depending on how the seller advertises/packages their product, 

the agencies pick and choose who they believe is distro-ing "for" consumption.


**In the UK it is all completely legal**, except opium itself, and teabags of poppy pod grounds.

*That is "prepared" opium substance.*


it's VERY odd,

but it IS 100% legal in the UK to have FIELDS poppies growing on your land.


In fact, many people do.

It attracts little suspicion, too.


Pretty much the only people, who recognise the common decorative poppy,

as the very same as the Opium poppy, are the same people, 

who would be growing/hunting them for personal consumption.


Well, some others may have realised,

when they threw open their curtains to find me grinning up at them from their own garden, 

razor blade in hand, white latex running down their old flowers in front of me....


The reason it is exempt from laws,

is that they have always been extremely popular at the British summer flower shows, valued for their variety and beauty.


How very British. =]

**Letting poppy pod tea dry and then snorting residue?**


I'm curious if anyone has tried making poppy pod tea and then letting it dry like in the oven then scraping up the residue and snorting it... or maybe just eating it...


just thought about how you do a CWE that way...would it work with poppy tea? or would you lose all your goods when the water evaporates?


your thoughts...

You will end up with what we call pod putty , because of the high amount of plant fats in it it can only be taken orally , smoking is a waste and snorting it after mixing with water is possible but it will make snorting tabasco seem mild.


seriously i tried far too painful even if it gives decent effects (almost on par with snorting mscontin)

This Pods vs. Seeds debate could and will go on for centuries.  I still find it interesting (perhaps because I've only been following it for 2 years!), however, because I was once firmly in the Pod camp and now am firmly in the Seed camp.  I think one thing that confuses people who swear against seeds is that they are buying the supermarket seeds.  There are two big problems with that: 1.) cost 2.) more importantly, they're shit! 

You have to think logically here and realize that they're washed.  Sure, you might get a minor buzz (like a tylenol 3) off them, but that's it.  Is it good for business if your seeds are causing false positives on good little school teachers and accountants who just had a couple of muffins?  No.  So McCormick and Safeway and whatever wash em.

Buy the bulk seeds from the dirtiest looking importer you can find.  You have to live in a major city, I live in L.A., so I'm lucky... there's plenty of dirt. lol

Use a lot.  I buy 5lb. bags for $17.50 and get two doses.  Thats 2.5 lbs per dose, but only $8.75 per dose.  I'm feeling a high that is comparable to 3 - 500 milligrams of morphine that lasts all day for $8.75.  That's not bad, and much better than pods (for that potency)

It's quicker...  no grinding just washing.

Be sure you put some muscle into it.  I put it in a pot on simmer and stir at least 200 times.

My last point is entirely subjective, and therefore not really open to debate... but I can't stand pod tea... emmm I just quivered thinking about drinking it... seriously... seed tea isn't like a chocolate shake but it's doable.

There, I had to chime in...

Oh, I also wanted to comment on the poppy pod illegality in the United States.  I was arrested about 6 months ago and had my house searched.  I had two little dried p. soms in a weird melting type vase (I thought it was trippy)  The cops asked me what they were and I told them straight up, what they were and how I used them.  When I got out of jail and got my possessions back from the county thugs there were the two little poppies, safe and sound next to my belt...

**Poppy Tea Withdrawl**


Im curious, I have been taking opiates, Oxy, hydro, on and off for years now and it's been 3 weeks since I've had any in my system. I made poppy pod tea this weekend. Friday I had one cup of 4 pods. Sat 2 cups 5pods, and Sunday 1 cup 4 pods...I'm done now and don't plan on taking any more this month...Should I expect withdrawls from this amount??

You might but it shouldn't be to bad. Since it was 3 weeks since you had any opiates and you only did pods for 3 days i wouldn't think your w/d would be to bad.


If anything you might have a little insomnia and maybe mild flu-like symptoms but then again you may not have any w/d. It just depends on your system.


I wouldn't worry to much. But, who knows. Personally i think you'll be ok.


let us know how it goes.

^ sounds exactly right


poppy pod tea WD comes on in such a way it's really easy to wonder if you are just sick, or what


then after the symptoms persist and you realize drinking the tea fixes everything, you know


once you are at this point, taking pods for anything except to taper off is like standing in a hole while you dig

the further you go the more brutal the climb out

back to pods..  jesus.  theres no way to be arrested for dryed pods.  even if a cop saw you making tea, which is a very highly unlikely situation, its still very hard to even be prosecuted for dryed poppy straw.  later.

Yeah i hate all the bullshit they tell you about drugs, it really pisses me off.  Wonder if they thought about what would happen when kids realized they were being lied too.  Then they might not believe the truth about how dangerous some drugs are.  They should just focus on the truth and statistics and more about addiction and going though wds, instead of negative health affects which many kids dont care about anyway.

**Still Working on It**


Kind of think that instructions on making the perfect product have been over-read (i.e. too many opinions only cloud the issue).  So far, it has worked to keep one well, but not to get high.


Latest conclusion, is that not enough water has been used - just enough to cover the grounds, and cooking 3x for 30 minutes using a hot pot.  Now posts have been found that say to use anywhere from 3:1 to 5:1 ratio, otherwise water will no longer absorb the alkaloids.


One of the most confusing, is that so many people that say not to let the pods bubble or boil, or get above 82c/180F.  Yet it's often said here, that 375F is just fine, and boiling is not a problem.


Anyone have any idea of why the 82c max is so prevalent?  Was it just like some old-wives tale that has since been debunked?


Then some talk about just consuming them.  Yet, aren't there ingredients in them, that one would prefer NOT to ingest, if given the choice?  Not to mention the work it places on the digestive system, and the time to get any reaction.


The thing that sounds best is the "laudanum" route, if one could only come across enough at once to wait two weeks before ingesting.


2p anyone?


Had to add this.  This is nuts.  It isn't rocket science, why is such a difficult time being had by him, who usually picks up new things with alacrity?  Oh yes - it never tastes really bad either - at least nothing like everyone speaks of.  Different vendors & strains being used. Last night's experiment was 40g powder cooked 3x in approx. 1 qt. water, with lemon at approx. 150f (hot pot temp difficult to specify).  Produced approx 1.5 liters which was then ice-o-lated 2x by allowing thin clear crust to form on top of sideways decanter and filtered.  Left overnight.  At 5pm over half gone, with little to show.  (except it is 1st day with no subsidy, but only two $6 items being used - no large amounts - ever).  This research getting  expensive and boring.  Sorry for the boring post....

**how long between doses of poppy team**


i am new to poppy tea and just got my first pods today. i ground up 5 medium pods and ran them though my coffee maker. i ended up with about a half a cup of liquid and put that in a cup. i added juice to flavor and made about 1 cup. i drank approximately half of the cup to see how i felt and i'm feelng alright. so i was wondering how long i should wait for the full effects to kick in? i want to finish the cup but don't want to over do it.

So how long was it since you drank half?


I suggest you wait an hour if you never had poppy tea before , though if you are used to it you should feel the first effects coming on within half an hour.


Now im going to merge this into the mega poppy thread , don't start these kind of threads in od please.

I think 82c is the temperature at which codeine starts degrading , codeine is a lot more sensitive to heat than morphione but it plays a minor role


oh and if you boil for hours you will end up with an inactive product

it's been 45 minutes. i personally thought i could feel it in minutes due to having an empty stomach upon consumption but that could have been pacebo excitement effect. the liquid wasn't very dark it looked like weak tea or coffee, see through brown. pretty much i have a really nice relaxed care free feeling going on. i gotta say i like it. its not like eating 5 or 6 percs or vics but it's good none the less.

it wasn't real bitter but that might have been the juice. the taste is definatley somethng you would aquire. it's kind of earthy, pungent and bitter. the smell of the wet pods reminded me of the taste of shrooms. i went ahead and drank the rest of the cup. I'm thinking i'm definately a poppy pod fan.

so would you say that simmering for 30 min. at a time would be okay? (don't mind loss of codeine, at all)


how about starting ratio of pod to water?

don't boil.


well, i have heard others do it, 

but morphine breaks down in heat, simple as.


boil some water, then pour it in;

do not boil the water, with the pods in there.


maintaining a temp of ~90degC would be ideal,

though this is not not necessary.


i usually just use boiling water,

leave for 30 mins, drink (add ice if its too hot), then make another extraction with half the amount of water, for half the time.

mostly just to reduce to % loss within the soaking grounds.


i.e 100ml lost out of a 1000ml dissolved 100mg is 10%, 10mg.


so (900/1000)*100mg = 90mg yield. 10mg remaining


once more, (900/1000)*10mg = 9mg yield. 1mg remaining


total extract 99/100mg  -  99% yield


not worth it after that.

short Boiling doesn't break down morphine in my experience and that of many others . Opium is typically purified by boiling it so believe me the losses are minimal and only codeine  if any.


Naw i never did an alcohol extraction since making tea works so well , i would think alcohol would pull out a lot of plant fats.

i guess i'm just not cut out for the poppy experience...i've tried twice now..the first  time the effects were very mild...but i know know i made a weak tea and i couldn't drink it all. and the second time(this morning) i couldn't make myself drink it.. I almost wanna puke just when i smell it. i tried in grapefruit juice this morning and still couldn't do it...![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


i'm very sad about this b/c i was really looking forward to this as it sounds like something i might like.


i take hydros on the regular and thought this might be a cheaper/ more efficient way to get high.. oh well

are you talking about poppy seed tea?  in my experience, color plays an important part, but bitterness is the true decicive factor, true.  you can be almost 100% certain, however, that if your tea is almost yellow, that it is bunk.  if it is a nice medium or dark brown, it's good in most cases (there are rare exceptions).  there's a poppy seed tea thread in the trip reports section where somebody posted a picture of a glass of PST and it was a nice medium dark brown.  the same color as I used to get when i had potent seeds.


edit:  nevermind, a few posts later and i saw you were talking about pods.  sorry.

^

How long it takes to get addicted to opiates is both personal, and psychological.  It also depends on whether you've ever been addicted before.


With a history of prior addiction, it can take only 3 days to get addicted again. For a newbie, it isn't likely for at least 5 days or more - imho.


But the psychological factor plays a large role in any addiction.  I've found that at times, if you're a beginner, and you just don't think about it, it might not happen at all with short-term use - especially if you haven't gone wild.


Not saying that the physical part doesn't exist - but much of it can be avoided, if you don't expect it to happen, and keep your mind occupied with other things.

Man Like I said before I just love eating the pods. Getting a coffee grinder was the best investment ever. I grind till its a flower like powder than eat a spoonfull and chase will some strong ice tea or fruit juice. It makes it better for stealth dosing too because of my mom being home sometimes and my sisters SxE boyfriend being here. Its also more potent to me weight for weight than making tea or putty. Its  the best way to take pods IMO

Ever try a blender? I find they work better for all plant matter mainly because they are more powerful. The motors for blenders are usually in the range of 400-550watts where coffee grinders will be 30-120watts.

According to the Merck index, (the "bible") Morphine decomposes at 254 - 256 degrees. So boiling water which is only 212 degrees, really should not be a problem.

**re-using pods (ground up) to make tea**


I had used about 40 pods to make some tea, I saved the ground up pods and put them in a plastic bag in my drawer. They smelled like shit (moldy sortof smell). This didn't stop me! I boiled some water and threw them all in the pot, went to church because my dad made me, and I just got back, the water was cold and I chugged it all. It tasted somewhat potent but also much nastier. 


Normally I can down a glass of fresh PPT without any taste problems. This time, the moldiness taste and the lukewarm water almost made me gag. Anyway, I drank it all...do you think i'll get any opiates out of the grounds? do you think i'll get sick?


I know I probably should have asked this before I drank all the tea but eh, sometimes I do shit backwards. Your responses are appreciated.

will you get high? no. 

will you get sick? possibly. if it actually smelled *moldy*, i'd prepare myself for an upset stomach at least ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png).

did you chug that for nothing? ...in all likelihood, yes, because you've already washed it of most attainable alkaloids and whatnot the first time (assuming you did it properly)

You can also just grind them ahead of time and then all you need to dose is some small amount of liquid to mix the powder into. Easier then going through the putty procedure.

poppy pod tea is best experienced about once every 10 days...... 


after about 7-10 days you can drink tea again and feel great.......


Its really not worth doing more than once a week for me anyways,,  Tolerance builds fast as hell and its just not worth it........


I've taken just about every opiate possible; and in my experience poppy tea is the best because it has so many different alkaloids that produce such a nice synergistic effect..........


THe effects last long 12-24 hrs


Recreational use is a blessing from god; daily or semi weekly uses reaches into the depths of hell

yeah i get afterglow til about 24 hours after. crazy cool length.


also, sleep is GOOD. getting high then the next morning im still pretty good, and SO refreshed and nicely awake.


great.


still, real opium is best.

i got a few grammes of O this year, and still have fuckin loads (1000+) of pods (leaving em to dry out naturally).


yeah, pod tea is great and lasts much longer than real O,

but fuuuucking hell Opium just trumps it BAD.


my favourite, is to swallow 3/4 dose with a triple shot of vodka,

then smoke the remaining 1/4 while you wait for the rest to work.

smoking properly, of course, vaporising, basically like heroin.

This is good, because first you get the nice little vodka kick,

then you get the rush of smoking, very euphoric and smooth,

then as the 3/4 comes on, you get a nice early nod, VERY warm and fuzzy,

then as the smoked wears down, your left with a smooth, cool afterglow of that,

combined with the nice warm, floaty vodka/opium high from the eaten 3/4.


Everyone should try it.

So, so fucking good.


well, until you feel like you're shitting out small stone pyramids.

Anyone else feel that kicking pods is a very tough thing to do?  I've been using the pods for exactly one month now, my dosage is about 4 large pods, sometimes daily and sometimes everyother day.  I used to be nodding off of like 4 small pods last month...


Anyway, I certainly don't feel I need opiates to get through my life, I'm content enough with weed, but now that I've experienced it I crave that nodding feeling, and that warm body rush I've come to associate with the tea.


It's very bizarre, even in my dreams I'm usually trying to get high on pods!  And during my last withdrawal episode, whilst tossing and turning all night I finally fell asleep and what do I dream about?  Ah, some random box of pods has shown up at my house, how wonderful, now I don't have to worry.  And my whole damn dream consists of me trying to make the pods.


It's pretty freaky when I subconciously crave them in my dreams... I never dream about smoking weed like this.  Wierd, eh?

no, not weird.

opiates are addictive and you shouldnt use them.


you used for one month, and you are already on a dose a day.


Stop.


You are someone who will get addicted.


I have used opiates for about a year and a half,

and i've never gotten high more than twice in a week.

usually less than once a week.


That is just me.


If you have that habit already, after one month, just stop.


you crave. you are an addict in the making.

it is not worth it.

if you ever want to feel that beautiful opiate feeling again,

STOP DOSING NOW.


allow once a month.


you get addicted to easily, do not risk it.


once a month is more than 30 times better than once a day.

I used to take opiates every day for a couple of yrs.. but now i take the tea once in a while and the experience alone almost makes me not want to do it again for a while because it is so overpowering.......

Ya know, I used kratom on a nearly daily basis (but never more than once a day), and I felt that was a fairly safe opiate for me.  I wouldn't increase my dose past a certain point, when I didn't get high anymore I just took a break for a day or two and then the next day I would feel the sedation again.  Kratom withdrawals were a joke compared to pods.


The way I got started on pod tea was for the nod... I could never nod off of kratom, too damn stimulating.  Tried the tea... and the rest is history.  


Thanks for the advice Idler, I'm not terribly worried about my situation, it's been 3 days without the pods now and while I am most certainly experiencing a withdrawal, I'm doing okay.  I realized that the danger with pods is that I can just keep upping the dose to get high, haven't really hit a cap.  But I don't want to find the cap if there is one, so I decided to take a break now because there's no point chasing the high if it's going to start getting real expensive and difficult.


It's really the half life that kills me with these things, allows for tolerance to build so much quicker.  I'd do better with a short acting opiate, and as short acting goes ya can't beat kratom.  If I can ever get off these fuckers I should go back to kratom, but now I wonder if the high will feel good to me anymore, even after my tolerance goes down,  now that I've experienced a much stronger opiate and built had a tolerance in the first place.

What's your definition of an opiate? Kratom definitely isn't an opiate in the sense that it doesn't come from the poppy plant, but it has been proven that it's metabolites can bind to your opioid receptors. It's not a great opioid, and someone with a high tolerance most likely wouldn't get much out of it, other than withdrawal relief.

I wish i enjoyed pods/Morphine more than i do. It's my least favorite drug. But, when i am out of everything i do still use pods. But, Morphine makes me so lazy and when on it i don't want to do a darn thing and it's so frustrating and i get deeply depressed.


I've always enjoyed a more stimulant high than a body-high that Morphine gives. Morphine makes me unmotivated, lazy, depressed, uncreative... blah blah.


When i first tried pods i liked it, i didn't LOVE it.. i mean it was ok. I just wish i enjoyed it as much as you guys enjoy it because it's so damn easy to get (pods/Seeds). It sucks.


Pods might as well be water to me now. Water that makes me well/out of withdrawal but i don't get pain relief or high from it.


I'm glad someone can enjoy it. Oh and no, i didn't do pods everyday. One dose lasted me 12-18 hours. 


I currently do about 10-15 medium pods. I can go up to 20 pods but that's not usually cost effective for me. The more i do, the faster they go... the more often i need to order. But, i don't think I'll be ordering pods anymore.

^ I agree. The organic opiates are the least desirable of all opioids IMO. I never got depressed from the morphine/codeine high, but it is somewhat sedating and the high you get from opium isn't as enjoyable as most semi-synthetic opioids. 


If you like a stimulating opiate high, you'd definitely like IR fentanyl, but I wouldn't advise ever trying it if you haven't. It's like the crack of opioids because it's short acting, rushy, and it hits you faster than most other opioids.

**Help with Poppy strain I.D**


I saw a picture in some book of poppy's coming into flower, they were multi podded, short and have wide leaves. The flowers are single petal and coloured white/purple with a purple stripe in the middle and whitish/purple for the rest. Depetaled pods are quite large.


Any ideas as to what strain these could be?

As Idler said - not weird at all.  I don't get the phenomenon, but it happens to almost all opiate users I know.  Whenever you stop -the dreams come.  And you always wake up before you get around to doing it.


Except in one dream I had - this WAS really weird - I did actually shoot before waking up.  


Using every day is not a good thing.  From my POV however, kicking 4 pods should be next to nothing - physically, that is.  I wrote earlier about the difference between psychological and physical addiction.  For a really long period of my life (like 20 years, or so) I did H 2 or 3x/mth.  Never got addicted.  For a short period of my life, somewhere during that time, I was doing Dilaudid every day.  When I stopped, I didn't know I was addicted, and I just felt like I had a cold.  Not bad enough to go running around trying to cop something.


After those 20 years however, due to a turn of events in my life, I did start doing something everyday - just to come down from the base my boyfriend was giving me, that I really didn't like.  I was able to stop using the base, but even after, was never been able to return to that 2 - 3x monthly thing.  Once you really get addicted, it's a bitch to stop.  Not to be motherly - I'm not that sort at all - but I'd strongly advise, especially if you've already hit the daily mark, which I avoided for so long, you are definitely prone to addiction, and if you really do want to avoid it -- QUIT NOW!

So... I haven't been on the board for a while, and I'm only now responding to older posts - I apologize for my belated reactions.


But, RPG, I'm so surprised to hear you saying this stuff - from your earlier posts, I thought you were a huge fan.  


Your feelings towards it are about identical to mine.  Or at least were - except that I barely even liked it when I first tried it.  Until I titrated up sufficiently.  


In recent weeks, an odd thing happened however, and even though I still haven't caught a major buzz from them, the last time I ran out, and didn't have the money to order enough to make it worthwhile (like at least 40 or 50 - I usually require over 45g - and although that's less than 20 pods, it's due only to the cost factor), I was honestly bummed.  I had just made it through 2 days w/o my usual, and didn't want to return.  Especially since the quality of my usual is so unpredictable. Still can't say I love pods though, and I too envy those who do.


Then again - I have no access to fent.  Oxy does little for me, but I'm afraid I'd love the former.  Must be hanging out in the wrong places, as I've never been able to locate any.  My DOC was dilaudid - I'm guessing it's similar, but that too is out of reach these days.  It was the only thing that always got me going, feeling great, and creatively productive.  Guess you really can't beat pharma's.


Right now I'm really happy to be back with pods again - for the time being, at least.  Sometimes just feeling well, can be a sort of satiation, in it's own right.

**re: Help with Strains**


okay - i'm back again - monopolizing things today, or so it seems.  i've just started investigating different strains myself, since so few vendors mentions exactly what strain it is that they're selling.  in fact, i think most probably don't even know.  


yet, i've started believing that it can make a big difference.


for example, i don't think i like arizonas (actually, I'm not even sure that they are true pap soms).  can't say for sure, since the only time i knew that they were really what i was using, i didn't yet know how much i required.


some people say they don't like thebaine - yet it's the base of all pharmaceutical opiates. others rave about tazzies, and taz are the strain that contain the most of it.  recently had a blend of 3 strains - taz, indian raja, and hens & chicks - it was quite potent.


i've tried doing some research on the strains, but have yet to find a wealth of information.  does anyone know how to identify strains by the look of the pod, or know a good source on the subject?

Did some Seed tea this morning. Was pretty strong. Not as strong as i wish it was but it was enough to get me up doing some things. And i can't find my darn Kratom but i don't need it right now anyway. What could i have done with a small bag of Kratom? lol.


Although I"m not a huge fan of Morphine, I'd love some pods right now. Oh well. Tomorrow should be a lot better, it's my script day.

 but twice now i have had the first glass (first wash) and the nausea has just been overpowering after about 20 mins- halfa hour, ive tried all the normal laying down feet up ect but cant hold it down...and if i spew it back up...nada effects..... maybe im drinkin it too quick, anyone else get this?.... i was thinkin of having a maxalon to combat it  but as of yet havnt as all of it is like 4 yrs outta date.

 any good/maybe safer nausea combantants?  ive only ever had such sickness and vomiting with a decent dose of morphiene (IV) when i had quite a low tollerence back in the day.dont understand why sometimes i can hold it others i cant. could it be maybe they r totaly unwashed straight into the bag seedz and theres just a whopper dose of op8 in it?  cant wait 4 tha pods to come about![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) i prefer them much more... any suggestions welcomed![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

does anyone have any firsthand experience with tasmanian poppy pods? there's a type grown there that don't produce morphine, instead more thebaine. would a pod tea made with excess thebaine make you sick? would the tea actually have any of the desired effects as the papaver somniferum does?

It depends most people call unknown pods and seeds tasmanians and really there turkish or some other variety. 

I have heard from a lot of people that they're annoyed with the effects from their tasmanina poppys that they grew from seeds that were originally imported from tasmanian alkaloid company's growers which are very reluctant to hand their seeds out, with that heard and repeated I have found brand name culinary seed suppliers that offer seeds from that have originally came from tasmanian alkaloid companies by the 50 pound bar for around $180 usd.


I my self think that the tasmanian strain is very useful in the right hands, but if you just drinking tea and you are use to other types of somniferum you might not be expecting the effects. I like them personally, but I haven't found to many types of Somniferum that I haven't like too much.

**Eating poppy pods -**


I've seen a number of people mention in passing that they actually eat pods by mixing them with yogurt or ice cream.

It just seems to me one would have to eat a huge bowl of yogurt to get down 5-6 big pods. Would you like some lactose intolerance pills with that? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 

Anyone prefer eating them and if so care to share this less discussed experience?

I ground them up and added chocolate soymilk to it so it was like an oatmeal consistency and I sweetened it a little more also. I don't like the consistency of oatmeal so that was the only reason it was hard to get down. It actually didn't taste all that bad, the chocolate and sugar hid the bitter pod taste pretty well. 


I usually just make tea, wash it twice, strain it through ice to cool it and then mix it with equal parts lemonade and pod tea. If I do it right its almost indistinguishable from an arnold palmer. 


The oatmeal-type prep MIGHT be a little stronger than the tea but it took a little longer to kick in and lasted considerably longer. I usually stick to the tea because I can just down that really quickly whereas the oatmeal takes a while to eat.

Thebaine won't get you high, it will make you feel sick and can cause convulsions. I don't know if there are any experiences in this thread, in the AusDD poppy seed thread there are a few thebaine-related experiences however.

Well if you are lactose intolerant use something other then dairy products.


Its actually very easy to consume since its nothing but dry powder the consistency of cocoa mix or protein powder, mixes into liquid or semi-liquid very easy.

**Eating Poppy Pods = Pure agony, no high**


So, last night, a friends of mine got some poppy pods.  P. somniferum, untreated, uncoated, said the seller.  


This friend doesn't have a grinder yet, so he just broke up the pods, put a little peanutbutter on them, and munched them up.  For the record, this was 2 "medium" pods; about the size of a golf ball.


About an hour later, he starts to feel a bit sick, but not any of the other opiate sensations.  The pain in his stomach fades, and he decides to eat another one.


For the next 16 hours, his stomach is in phenomenal pain: he is unable to move without sharp pains in his stomach.  The next morning, he still can't eat anything for 5 hours (about 20 hours since initially eaten) and has the shits like no other.  Although he's been kind of sedated and out of it, he feels that this is more from his sleep deprivation due to the sickness than it had anything to do with opiates.


Wtf?  Were his pods poisoned or something?  They weren't shiny or smell weird or anything.  This was his first pod experience and it was absolutely miserable: 24 hours of absolute agony with absolutely no high.


Any idea what's going on here?

Ive experienced MASSIVE abdominal cramping from panadeine forte (30mg codeine 500mg paracetamol) before only had 4 of them. I would have rated it a 9/10 on the pain scale, I actually passed out after an hour it was that intense.


Went to the hospital and they gave me something IV for the intestinal spasms and it went away. Its possible it could have been something like this.

That sounds absolutely miserable.  I've heard of opiates causing nausea before, but never sharp stomach pains; that's part of what freaked out my friend so much.


Anybody else have an experience like this, or better yet, a way to take the pods without all the pain?  I've read about the tea, but thought ingesting the grounds (whole pod) was simply more efficient/longer lasting?

Ok when you hear people say ingest the grounds, they mean ground up pods that are the consistency of powder after being run through a electric coffee grinder. NOT eating dry pod pieces.


As for your friend it may be he has a sensitive digestive system or could just be allergic to morphine or something in the pods. It could also be something totally different as you said he was sleep deprived? Would that be because of stimulants or other drugs? It could be a lot of things, for the record I've used probably thousands of pods and never experienced sharp abdominal pain.

To the question about eating pods.  I eat my pods.  I used to make tea, but making tea every morning is a hell of a lot harder than mixing up grounds into some yogurt.  You don't need a coffee grinder, a blender works fine.


I've never had any trouble eating pods.  IME 3 large pods eaten seem to equal about 5 pods turned into tea (but it's hard to say considering the variability of each individual pod).  Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to eat my bowl of poppy mush and yogurt every morning as apposed to spending about an hour to make and cool tea.  I think it's more of a convenience factor than an effectiveness factor.  also tea is much rougher on my stomach than eating grounds mixed with yogurt.....strawberry banana FTW!!!

^ Hey man, its not really any of my business, I say this only out of concern for you well being, not in a judgmental way, but I thought you were clean from opiates...

Did you fall off the wagon?

If so, know that I have your back if you want to get clean again.

Thanks for all the feedback, everyone.


Of course, I have more questions:

Do you think the difference between ground vs. whole would make a difference in terms of digestion?  This was a terrible experience for 16+ hours.


Has anyone else experienced this kind of abdominal misery from eating pods before?

I think the more plant material you ingest the more likely you are to get sick and have cramps.


So I'd stick with boiling as you only want the morphine, you don't want the million other alkaloids.

I honestly can't believe that people can put pod powder in yogurt and eat it.


I attempted this one time.  All the little gritty pieces of pod were extremely tough, unable to be chewed at all, and extremely bitter.  I downed some of the material but eventually gave up as it was too disgusting.  The yogurt didn't really mask the disgustingness of it for me.


I didn't get much nauseau though.

You may want some of the alkaloids, they contribute to the very long duration poppy pod tea has compared to morphine.

Well, my friend just made some tea.  Just 1 medium pod, no stem, no crown, no seeds, ground to a powder and steeped in hot water with green tea for 30 minutes.  Had half the tea, minor stomach discomfort but no real high, so 30 minutes later, he finishes the tea.  So far, his stomach just hurts and he feels slightly dysphoric.  This time, he even gave the pod a quick wash/dry before grinding it so as to (hopefully) remove any pesticides.


1 clean ground pod, steeped with green tea for 30 minutes, consumed over an hour = stomach pains, minor sedation and dysphoria.  Any ideas?


**Edit:**Over the next hour, his stomach pain slowly subsided, but he still felt more sedated than euphoric.  The pod powder wasn't very bitter either.  Think it's just lousy pods?

Im about to purchase some pods, and try to make tea with them. My question to you all is: "How much should I use?" I don't have a scale to measure the weight, unless I bring it to lab, but Im not doing that. So 15mg of hydrocodone usually do me good, this is my first attempt at the poppy. Any Idea how much (about) or how many (what size) pods I should use for my first time? \


Also, this is the basics, correct me if im wrong:

1. Grind to powder

2. Put them in hot water, not quite boiling for 20 minutes or so

3. Filter

4. Flavor (optional)

5. Consume


Does that sound right?

I can't comment on dosing, but that procedure does sound more or less correct.  My friend used boiling water dumped onto the grounds and let them soak for 40+ minutes.  He drank the tea over an hour and said it turned out rather well.

15 mg hydrocodone is a pretty low tolerance, so I'd suggest starting with 2 pods and work your way up from there with more tea if you don't feel an onset in 20-30 min. 


It's very possible to OD on pod tea, even if it seems innocuous. Keep that in mind and be safe.

**Poppy Pod Tea**


Okay, I ordered my first shipment of poppy pods, from nowhere in particular. It is my first time with this sort of tea and I am going to post what regimen I am going to follow to extract the alks. Please modify, or suggest/advise me to alter any step to guide me along. Has anyone ever ordered from the poppy pod depot and found them to be good? In advance, thanks for the posts everyone. And from a few replies I was told to start with two pods at first, since it's my first time, and my tolerance (to feel good) is about 15-20mg of hydrocodone, or 15mg of oxycodone.


Step:

1. Grind up two pods to a fine powder


2. Pour grindings into hot water and let simmer for 20 minutes. Here do I maintain the temperature, or do I just let it cool to room temperature after pouring the grindings?


3. Filter out the pod grounds. And what color should a 'good tea' come out to be when all the grounds are filtered out?


4. Consume. And this onset should kick in about how long?


* Any potentiators please feel free to lmk. I know of grapefruit juice which provides that inhibitor, I forget the name. And there was another, tagamet, which I am not aware of (details?). Thanks for the help again all.

When I make pod tea I heat up the water to a boil, or just below a boil and pour the water onto the grounds in a nalgene bottle and then let it sit for ~15 minutes shaking regularly. I never cooked it on the stove or let it simmer. I get good results from my method but I couldn't tell you if its the most efficient. 


I don't know if we can talk about where we got the pods from, so mods feel free to delete this if need be- if by 'the poppy pod depot' you mean the ebay store by that name, then yes I regularly get pods from there and they are good quality and from what I've seen, the prices are pretty good as well. 


There is a poppy-pod mega-thread that you should check it. It has answers to all of your questions and probably any more you may have.

I can't really find any info on it, and i've searched a bunch:

Would an A/B extraction work on dried pods?  Or even an DMT style freebase extraction work on dried pods?


anyone know? or at least have a link to send me in the right direction?  With my limited knowledge of chemistry I'd assume a DMT freebase extraction should work on dried pods yielding a smokable morphine/codeine/etc base.  Anybody?

Pods have highly variable alkaloidal content, as well as each person having highly variable physiology, so noone is ever going to be able to tell you how much a "hit" is.


The guideline I always throw out for normal sized pods, which would be the ones you are talking about, is 5 pods for 2 cups, both drinken (not sure on the English for the previous word) in one sitting so that would be an equivalent answer. IF you find it does not suffice, build up very slowly in increments, with 6 hours between dosing.

i always start new folks to pods off with 4-5... 5 if they're really only golf ball sized..


Personally I take like 8-10 good sized ones, sometimes 12-14 golf ball sized even..... it really is just a matter of your personal tolerance to opiates.


When I did pods a lot, if I was running low, I would just grind them up and eat the powder raw (chasing with soda).  I found that I could get just as high on less pods that way as the tea often won't extract all the alkaloids at 100%, but it does make you want to gag.

I just received an order for some large heads. I am pretty inexperienced with them. I have made tea 2-3 times and it was about 4 years ago. I have been reading a lot about them lately and everyone describes how nasty and bitter the taste is. Mine wasn't that bitter to me compared to Kratom (which I have been doing A LOT of lately)


So.... My question is this.

How does the taste compare to Kratom if the pods are prepared correctly?


I'm just curious as to whether I didn't make the tea right or If I am so used to the nasty taste of Kratom that it made the pod tea not taste so bad.

You might have a weak batch. I've found that the more bitter the tea is, the stronger the pods are. The best tea IMO is dark brown and bitter as hell. I actually have grown to like the taste- don't know if it's because I anticipate the effects or I just like it.

^^^^ewwww.  The seeds have no alkaloid content, there is no point leaving them in there.  Plus when you heat the seeds it's going to probably make your tea taste even nastier.


If they're golf ball sized I'd start with 3-5 pods for tea, 3 pods if eaten.

1) No prices please.


2) There is a poppy pod tea mega thread, which is where I'll send this question.


Rachamim is right, there is variation in the alkaloid content so it's hard to give an accurate answer. If they are large pods I'd suggest starting with one or two and then seeing how that works so you can gage a dose.

Yah man, seeds are narsty.  Pod tea is bad, but seed tea is dog shit as far as taste goes.  I dip some yummy Chai, Darjeeling or Goji berry teabags in with mine and add some powdered ginger to help with nausea.  It's bitter, but that "sweaty balls" taste is greatly decreased.

I've never tried it, but I'm pretty sure you would need to smoke a shitload to get effect.  It would be about as useless as smoking kratom, it might work but it just wouldn't be the slightest bit practical.


You would likely to have to smoke about as much as material as it takes to make a potent tea.  I dunno about you but I'd rather not smoke all those grounds, heh.


You have pea sized pods??  I've never seen them so small.

It seems like this will work, but I haven't heard of anyone doing it yet, which is a little surprising- could I theoretically grind up some pods and put them in gelcaps?


I've never bought the pods before, and would rather just wait for pills if I have to gag down some foul tea (I've had my fair share of PST and kratom lately...).


Edit: or maybe I could blend it in a smoothie?

The seeds from whole poppy pods contain little to no drugs; it's all on the pod itself. Now, commercial poppy seeds are lanced out of the pod, so some opium is very likely to drip or contanimate them.


I don't know this for certain, it's just what I've gathered through internet research.


Pods are hard enough on your stomach. The seeds add fats and other nasties that will make you very naseaous. I don't think its worth the minute amount of opium that may be on them.

Y'all should be careful when eating grounds. One time, I was eating grounds mixed with yogurt. I started choking really bad. I finally spit up what was stuck in my throat. It was that hard knob that connects the pod to the stem.


I gave up on grounds. Good ol' tea for me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Can someone help with an estimation on how many stems I should use?

I have been saving my stems from all my pods and intend to use them eventually. I do not have a scale unfortunately but here is some info:


The stems range in size from 3 to 5 inches.


I do intend on using a coffee grinder for prep.


My usual dose of pods is 5-7 golf ball size pods.


I really wanted to make another thread for this so i could get a lot of answers but I figured I'd put it here so nobody would remind me how many threads we already have about pods.


Thanks in advance.

I've saved 50 stems and made tea out of them when I was in need. The tea was weak, not even enough to feel 'normal.' I think there's very little, if any, active ingredients in the stems.

Hey Pod Eaters:


I used to eat ground poppy pods. I did this for about a week before I noticed I had begun shitting blood (like, it would be blood, bloody feces, then blood). The blood loss was much greater than what you get from the occasional tearing from having to pass a giant, sharp, opiate-constipated log.


I can't guarantee it was the pods, but it continued for 3 or 4 days after my last dose. Ironically, eating the grounds caused me less stomach pain and nauseau than the tea.


My advice: don't eat the grounds, or ensure they are *very* finely ground.

Hello All,


I've been lurking for a few days and reading all of the poppy pod threads I can. I apologize if I am mistaken, but has anyone given a solid answer on if it is possible to "cook down" poppy tea to some sort of concentrate or solid?


I know I read a post on how to cook it down for smoking but is that the only way anyone has any experience with? What about an alcohol extraction? I am somewhat new to the whole poppy tea experience so any info will be very appreciated.


Thanks

**the ugly podling**


Ok so, 

Earlier this evening I was preparing my tea and I found a "unique" pod. I squeezed to crack it open but it wouldn't break. It was very dense. I tried again but to no avail. The I put it on my floor and beat on it and it finally cracked. On the inside of the pod was this dried dark brown crap about 1/4-1/2 inch thick in a layer surrounding the inside of the pod. There was also no seeds or maybe a few. It was hard to tell. This is the only pod like it in the whole batch of 100. So anyway... have you guys ever seen something like this before? Was it not dried correctly and became rotten? Is it safe to use?

I've found these pods many times. The inside looks burnt almost, right? I usually get a couple in a batch of 75. I've used them before and was fine. But, if you want to be on the safe side, you could toss it.


Don't know the cause.

This subject might be covered somewhere in the 20x pages, frankly, I haven't been through all that. 


I've never had a great experience with the tea so I'm wondering about an extraction. I will probably try it with methanol one of these days. Just wondering if some of you guys tried it.

Yeh thats a good description. My only concern was if it was somehow damaged and all that stuff was just like a ton of opium that sapped out and caked around. I doubt thats the case, but yeh I didn't wanna use it with like 8 pods and then that one end up being super strong and get sick or something. I doubt that this logic is really fathomable. It's probably just a little rotten. I'll probably use it but not in a very strong cup.

if you eat the ground up pods (i grind them pour some juice on them) let them sit for 10 minutes or so - and chug it - you definitely feel it more than if you strain the tea out and just drink it.

i find this good for tapering.  i will measure my dosage by teaspoon and then go down a teaspoon at a time til i am down to 1 teaspoon a day and then go to 1 tsp every other day and then every 2 days and then 1/2 a teaspoon and so on - til none!

btw - like another BL mentioned - make sure your pods are ground as finely as possible if you are going to eat the soaked grounds.  otherwise they can tear up your insides.

I have been drink pod tea for the past 15 days, almost every day, ranging from 4-8 pods a day once a day. I started out at 4 but obviously my tolerance went up and am around 6-8 now. how long would I have to wait to pass a drug test and piss clean? I've read 2-3 days and 10 days. 


anyone have an answer?

i've ground the stems up (very fine) and mixed them with juice and let sit 10 minutes or so and drank them just like with the pods and it does help with w/d - but you need a lot of stems.  the seeds inside the poppies don't seem to do anything though but make me gag.

I hope so because I want to get a job and they wont be hiring in November. I was googling and read some random posts on forums stating that the alkaloids from the tea will show up as opiates for awhile, like 10 days with 3-5 days of use in a row


Ifanyone else has more information I would really appreciate it

I'm not sure if ratgirl was responding to my question or not, but I am going to try a couple of things and I was wondering if anyone would be interested in the results.


First off, I had some tea on Sunday. I usually powder my pods extreamly fine and then sift the remainder through a flour sifter.


I then use 4 table spoons of powder in a french press. I boil approx 2 cups of water then as soon as it starts to boil I turn off the heat and then add the water.


I let it sit 15 to 20 min stiring about every 5 min. The result is a tea that is so dark, it almost resembles coffee.


Trouble is, it's horrible tasting and smelling. I only get through about half and I usually share the other half with a friend. My tolorance is not that much I don't believe because this amount glues me to the couch for about 3 or 4 hours and leaves me with a horrible hang over the next day. IE headache, nausia, nodding heavily.


My thought proccess is 2 fold, I will experiment with an evap method and eat the result, also try and put the resulting material in a 000 capsule. I will also try using the powder in 000 size capsules and I will report back with results if anyone is interested.


Has anyone tried either of these methods? I read the post about doing an evap for smoking but I didn't see anything about eating or swallowing the material.

haha thanks bro!  but yeah its true you do have to be more careful. they Only times in my entire life that i truley thought i was about to od was after drinking grapefruit juice 15-20 minutes BEFORE drinking the tea.  to me the effect was so marked it was almost scary but it also allowed me to use a way lower dose of seeds/pods. you are smart and never forget what you have just told me!! (start small work your way up) thats the smartest advice anyone could give about taking any sort of drug. for example my friend gets FUCKING TRASHED off 2 ounces of poppy seeds with grapefruit whereas without he can take 4-5 ounces (i know these doses are extremely small, but he is naturaly vary intolerant to opiodes lucky bastard haha)

for me I have to use at least one pound of dank poppy seeds, up to 2 pounds. however with the juice, on 10-12 ounces I have felt in danger. (this was a while ago now adays im sure i would need 2 pounds even with the juice)

Just recently like in the last six months every local seller of bulk poppy seeds have literally doubled their prices, there was one that did not and then last time I checked yep price was double what it was.


My question is what has happened on the poppy seed market to cause such a sudden spike in price? Its obvious its supplier caused for every store to increase price that much.


Sadly pods are now much more economical, even though I prefer potent seed.

I get a large box of broken pods for about $40 this equates to a mixture of pod types but a lot of them! I then take and grind them all to dust using a cheap manual coffee grinder. 


I've never weighed the pods but I've got one on order so I'll weigh it and report back how much weight for the money.

Hey I been getting some weird "visual disturbances" on higher doses of pods, like when I been drinking the tea all weekend or something like that. It's weird, they are not really hallucinations...but It's like I'll see something out of the corner of my eye that catches my attention (things that ARE actually there) but it will look like something else to me. i.e... I'll see a piece of a candy bar rapper on the ground and think its a bug. Stuff like that. It has been happening A LOT and only when I'm on the tea.

Does anyone else get this?

Im sure something in ppt and psd is pyschoactive as generally the first thing you notice are disturbances in your peripheral vision as parts of this is made up by your brain based on what you saw earlier. However when on pot or other drugs you can mix up these things and think they are people when its a door etc. As long as you don't actually start hallucinating or become delusional etc I wouldn't worry too much.


Might be a hint to take it easy on the pod tea though, remember how addictive it can be.

OK

not only has price jacked up,

but QUALITY SEEDS are becoming rare as heroin, whearas ALL the bulk seeds USED to be dope.  its so fucking hard and alot of the good companies switched to bullshit seeds. i used to pay 3 dollars for a pound of the BEST seeds, (which i prefer to ANY pods or infact any other opies ive EVER done)

these days its 7 bucks for a couple ounces of dank seeds (if you can find them)


The grapefruit juice was 100 percent GFJ. thats the only thing i found that mattered (not red vs white)


pod tea is just as addictive as heroin infact its almost the same thing only it lasts ALL day so i think its more addictive. Always remember. heroin is essentialy morphine.  its just like morphine times 2, but it converts back to morph in the body. poppy habit is the same thing as a heroin habit, and infact if  you chug it and use the juice, I DO get such a hardcore rush at times i was worried i really was going to die

I cant imagine why ANYONE WOULD pay a dollar a mg, let alone ten cents a mg for oxy when poppy seeds can get you SO FUCKING wasted for a couple dollars. lets see 3 dollars for a pound that WASTES THE FUCK OUT OF ME, or 240 dollars for a shitty half assed oxy buzz which doesnt even make me nod..........hummm lets think about this

Its probably a good thing that the price has gone up, kind of regulates usage a bit. As much as I love opiates if there was a way to make them disappear off this earth I would do it, not just for me but for the pain they cause everyone else.


edit: Hmm I guess that would leave the people in legitimate pain up shit creek however. TOUGH CALL.

I'm not even going to point out how foolish you are, just remember that 90% of the pain caused by recreational opiate use is because of government prohibition.

Who cares if someone is a lifelong addict as long as opiates are cheap and legal, it wouldn't intrude on their life anymore then a daily jaunt to Starbucks.


Unless you're one of the fools that has some moral issue with drug use.

Same here, its hard for some to believe but potent seed tea was the best opiate experience I have ever had. A few other people have told me the same thing, I think its pretty dependent on personal taste and whether you like the rush and energy or sedation more.

I started with seed tea 5 years ago, switched to pods 3 years ago. I prefer PT.


I agree about the money issue. It's soooo much cheaper to buy seeds or pods. Oxy is rediculously overpriced. I indulge in the occasional oxy because I like a different buzz every now and then.


I really hope people are smart and discreet about using pods/seeds. It creeps up on you and it's really easy to take too much. The only times I ever came close to OD was pod tea. I worry that kids are going to start ODing and the next thing you know, it's illegal.

^if people are prone to addiction and you eliminate opiates, they'll just find something else. It seems apparent that just because a drug's supply is interrupted doesn't mean its demand will disappear.

Good point, however once you've tasted opiates for some you will never forget it. If they didn't exist or you at least never had the chance to try them, it would stop a lot of people getting hooked. 


Personally I first found them when I had my tonsils removed (oxycodone). This is the only reason I tried them and the only drug I have ever experienced addiction with. Since then its been on and off with poppy's, codeine and small amounts of oxy. 


Whilst I've experienced masses of pleasure I think the 2 weeks of tonsil pain would be worth never experiencing the power of opiates.

I find IMHO that the taste and the proccess of making the tea somewhat deters me from wanting to do it too often. Not to mention the HORRIBLE hang over I get the next day. Headache, nausia, nodding all day. I really don't want to do it that much because of it.


I've never (knocks on wood) had a physical addiction to anything although I have had psychological addiction to both pot and cigarettes. I have kicked the cigarettes and I only do about 1 or 2 hits of the pot each day. I lived with a girl who was an alcoholic. I was amazed at how alcohol could change her from a sweet caring girl into godzilla bitch!


Anyway, I hope you are able to get your addiction under control. It seems as if you want to so that's a step in the right direction.

2 - 3 days would probably be for just plain ol' morphine.


When you ingest pod tea, you take in the morphine along with cocktail of structurally similar alkaloids.  These structurally similiar alkaloids (noscapine, papaverine, etc.) most likely distract the liver enzyme(s) that is/are responsible for metabolizing the morphine.  The result is a greatly extended duration.


One simple exposure would probably take about 2 - 3 days to fully metabolize.  So consider 15 days of use, it could take quite a while for your  body to be rid of all that stuff.  So I would assume it's gonna be a while, probably 7 - 10 days.


I did the same thing as you when I first started with the pods, I used (nearly every day) for about 15 days.  I abruptly stopped and took a break, and I suffered moderate withdrawals lasting around 5 - 6 days before they were getting better.

Yo i just got done making some pod tea (I used about 5 or 6 LARGE pods). I grind up all the pods and put them in this lil tea infusion pot thingy i got, its used to prepare "loose-leaf" tea. So basically it just works as a giant tea bag except its a metal mesh screen. After i wait for 30mins or however long do i just drink the tea or do you eat/drink the poppy powder sludge? help me out its almost ready to drink.

Save the sludge for a second wash. I've heard of people eating it, but it would most likely make you puke.

This is a good Idea. I read somewhere in here that a good way to do it is to let the sludge sit in cold water for X hours until you are ready for your next dose. I believe in the post I am referring to he/she said they let it sit overnight, though I am sure it is not necessary to do it that long to get good effects. Anyway, when you are ready for your next dose, filter out the sludge again. if you are using an infuser as you stated get something to press the juices out from the sludge (I use a spoon). You can then discard the sludge and use the liquid for your next round of pods.


Also I tend to eat the sludge after I make the tea quite a bit. I just make sure it's a bit compressed (Again using a spoon). When I pop it out of the infuser it looks like a compressed mound of sand (like you are about to make a sandcastle). I then wash this down with water. This is the best way to make sure you get all the alkaloids. I have never gotten sick from it. I do have a strong stomach though.

well i just drank two glasses of it and am feeling some of the effects but i think its just the other alkaloids in the poppy that dont act on opiate receptors cuz i took 2mgs of suboxone last night, so its only been maybe 9 or 10 hours sense i took it.. but i still got another 3 or 4 glasses left (swim used 6 of the largest pods i could find out of the 75 swim has) They were label "Arizona Purples LARGE"

Yeah well like right now i just got the poppy sludge sitting in the infuser pot with water up to the top (cuz i drank two glasses) but its not that big so it should be pretty concentrated. You think its ok to just leavve it sit in there overnight and drink it tomorrow sometime after most this suboxone has worn off... cuz its weird i can feel effects from the pod tea but i dont think its any of the opiates, i dunno how does Pod Tea compare to breaking threw the suboxone blockade?

JahRed- AZ's are the way to go, but beware- there's a lot of vendors that claim they have Arizona's but they're weak. Once you find a reliable vendor, stick with 'em. It may take a few tries.

Well the ones i got look very nice and some of a purplish to them, some more so then others and are a good sized from like 4'-6'. Does Pod tea make u nod like normal opiates or is it more like a methadone kinda high? do u get the itchies off poppy pod tea?


ArtVandalay - Why do you say that the pods labeled Arizona's are the way to go?? is there something different about em? why are some purple and how come the inside of the pods dont have a bunch of dried up opium latex? i always wondered that one...maybe it dries to the walls and soaks in or something?

Nice, I've found that the ones with purple hues are usually strong.Yes, pod tea makes me nod and get itchies. You need a pretty strong dose to nod though. 


I've never had methadone so I can't compare but I actually prefer pods to most opiates. 


A couple years ago, there were good pods coming out of Arizona. Soon, a bunch of vendors were calling theirs Arizona's. Some of the best I've had were AZ's, but I've also had shitty batches labeled AZ.


Yes, I believe it's in the walls.

Pod tea feels just like methadone to me. it makes me nod when i lay down or relax just like methadone and it lasts for 12-16 hours. i usually make some around 4-5 pm and then i dip until i go to sleep. once i wake up the next morning i go about a half hour feelin normal and then usually lay on the couch and dip out for a couple hours. i dunno what you mean by other opiates or methadone cause they feel the same to me except for the fact that methadone lasts really long and makes me dip harder when i lay down and relax.

Hello all, wanted to tell of an awful experience I had last night.


I've been addicted to pods for about 3 months now, I've occasionally vomited when dosing, but nothing like this.  Here is what happened.


Last night I started experimenting with a new batch of Gigantic sized pods I had purchased.  I was in moderate withdrawal last night and to gauge potency I made a tea using 1 single pod.  My withdrawal was completely gone about an hour later.  


Eventually I decided I wanted to try and catch a buzz so I made a tea using 2 more pods and drank it.  An hour or so later, I barely felt anything so I took a little more about an hour later.  Then all hell broke loose.


I had went out to chill with some of my friends, but all night I knew something wasn't right.  Finally I vomited, but still didn't really feel better.  I cut things off early from my friends and went home.  I felt extremely thirsty and crappy so I tried drinking a glass of water and projectile vomited it a few minutes later.


I started feeling feverish so I lay down in bed.  I had goosebumps and felt either too hot or cold, much like a fever.  I didn't feel better for about 3 or 4 hours or so.  It was very unusual and it has never happened to me before.


I didn't really feel high at any point either.  I couldn't tell if I had ingested something nasty, or maybe if they just had crappy alkaloid content.  It was a scary experience though.

i had to cut my pod usage back.  it seems my body remember opiates (i was a heavy IV H user for years but have been clean for years) but when i was using pods even only 2 x 3 times a week (and i do eat the grounds) and btw i was only using 1 -3 pods - i started getting w/d after 2 days and then after one day and then the next day.  so now i'm tapering my pod usage (still drinking the sludge) and i'm down to 1-3 teaspoons of powder a day.  i still haven't been able to get past the 1 teaspoon mark - and by the time i do i feel the need to go back to taking one pod again.  for my pods 1 pod is approx. 5 teaspoons of powder.  i have tried mixing the pod sludge with lime juice - but not grapefruit juice.  i really couldn't tell much difference with the lime juice.

anyone tried tapering like this?  i notice that my stomach makes all sorts of noises every night after i lay down and this just can't be good for digestion.  certainly this slows down your digestion like it slows down the rest of your body processes.  well, hopefully, i can taper off finally and just save them for once a month or so partying.

any ideas?

I use more water than most people recommend actually. We have these nice 16oz. coffee cups and I usually fill one of those up and pour it in the pot and then pour in my pod mixture (usually 4-8 golf ball sized pods ground up in a coffee grinder). I can see how you could use "NOT ENOUGH" water but I can't really see how you could use "TOO MUCH" water, as long as you drink it all. Using these 16oz. cups I have found that with that much water the tea does not taste bad AT ALL. I'ts not great or anything but two teaspoons of honey - and I can put it down with no problem

I will say this though, I had a Kratom habit for a bit before I moved back onto the pods and the Kratom tastes 10X worse. So that may also be why it doesn't taste so bad to me. I would recommend you give the pods a chance with more water just to see if it is easier for you to put down. Add 2 teaspoonfuls of honey and a little sugar. If it makes it even harder for you to drink than I apologize in advance but it's worth trying right?

i'm sure it would be easier but my problem isn't always the taste than the amount of water i have to drink. once i drink 3 full glasses in an hour my stomach is just so full that i can't manage any more. Not really a problem cause i can take an hour break but i like to get it all down as quick as i can. 


I've found i can drink it easiest if i just get it cold, hold my nose, chug, and chase with grapefruit juice. the first few times I did it I tried adding all different shit to get it to taste better but it just made it worse. never held my nose back then though. I'll probably try more water next time and just take it slower.

Ahhh... see I usually drink one 16 ounce cup of tea in like 2 swigs. I realize a lot of people can't chug down anything that quick. But, yeh after about 2 hours when the first batch is really hitting me hard I will go make another cup but by then I certainly don't feel like I still have the first 16oz. of water in my bladder anymore. So I guess I as I am kinda confused as to why you are talking about "3 full glasses in an hour". Can you please explain?

Tnx.

Ok swim is about to order a 2nd batch of pods. What kind do you recommend? And does the SIZE of the pods matter when it comes to how potent the pods are or is it just matter what "kind" u get:


Is it safe to say that these one labeled "Arizona Purple" ones are the most potent? if not, or if so, what are some other good pods and what they are called??

There is really no way to tell, I've had pale pods that were potent and dark and purple hued pods that were weak. Arizona is just marketing bullshit, you know how there can be a potent brand of xtc tabs and then six months later everyone is making imitations to cash in on the word of mouth? Small deal with the Arizona pods.

One more quick question, can you use a coffee maker to make pod tea? cuz my friend does it that way but i've never heard of anyone on here or anywhere else on the net say they use a coffee maker to make their pod tea....so what up with the coffee maker?

probably uses a coffee grinder to mince the pods, then uses a coffee maker to infuse the water with the pod grinds. You'd probably need too many cups doing it that way though, be better off just cooking the grinds in a pot.

**Coffee Maker vs. Loose-leaf/Herbal Tea Infuser.**


so your saying that using a coffee maker to make pod tea wont work? cuz he uses the coffee grinder (like me) to powder the pods and then puts the poppy powder in the coffee maker and i guess just makes it just like u would coffee except instead of coffee grounds, its poppy powder and he swears it works good.


I just grind my pods in a coffee grinder and put them in my loose-leaf/herbal tea infuser pot thingy that my mom got for me awhile ago, its basically just a little pot that holds about 2 glasses and has a metal mesh cylinder thing that drops down into the center of the pot and i just put my pod powder in the metal mesh cylinder and then pour boiling hot water down into the cylinder until full and let it sit for about 30mins (sometimes longer if im not drinking it right away)..


what ways do you guys use to make ur POD TEA??!?!

It would work, but unless you made 10 cups out of it, it'll probably be wasting the grinds. Be better off just soaking the grinds for a while, then filtering them with a coffee strainer.

my preffered method is to get rid of any stem or nob, and jsut mill up pods in coffee grinder to a FINE flour. 

then i pour it Right directly into juice and drink it rather deliciously ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Following up on my post above, over the weekend I began 2 experiments. The first was a heated water evap. I used 8 table spoons of powder to make tea. I let soak for about 45 min in 4 cups of water at 193 degrees F. The result was a coffee looking liquid. I strained the plant material and squeezed out all the liquid I could. I put the plant material aside and placed the tea in a pot on an electric stove. Turned the burner on it's lowest setting checked temp and was between 190-193 degrees f. 


I evaped over a 6 hour period until the liquid was about a half inch from the bottom of an 8inch round pot. I transferred the liquid to a glass pie pan and placed it in the oven at 180 degrees for 4 more hours until all the water was gone. The result was a dark reddish brown material caked on the bottom of the pie pan. 


What I Learned:


Use a disposable tin pan or something very non stick. Do not add anything like spray but use teflon or something that would be flexable to flake out the material. I am still "chipping" the material off the bottom of that glass plate.


The second experiment I took 2 tablespoons of powder and 1 cup of Vodka, put them into a small 16oz plastic bottle, shook vigorusly and placed in the fridge for 24 hours. I then strained and squeezed the pland material out and placed the resulting mixture in a small foil bread tin. I will leave it as long as it takes to eveporate. 


I had to settle for 00 size capsules as it was all I could get at the moment. This weekend, I will be loading the material from the water evap into capsules and try it. I will report back here with the results.

all i can say is that pods are no joke.  i was a junkie for over 7 years and i've been off opiates for almost 7 and just recently started messing with pods.  the first time i tried pods one pod actually kicked my ass!  i even threw up and i never ever threw up when i was IVing H (not even the first time).  another thing is it is so easy to get a pod habit.  i am currently trying to get away from pods and the least i can do without feeling a little w/d is 1 tsp. of powder...  so i'm tapering down from that now to none....   pods are very, very strong stuff!

amazing!

**IYE, what is a better value?**


So I have stuck with the same verity of pods (large - basically golf ball sized) from the same vendor. Now of course I am not asking about vendors, but in your experience are the bigger ones worth the extra money? Is it more economic to buy the biggest ones? Is there any difference in the money you save or should I just stick with the golf ball sized ones?

The bigger ones require less effort when making the tea, as there are fewer pods to prepare.

Not necessarily. Sometimes the big ones are potent, other times they are weak.

size has NOTHING to do with potency, sorry. best bet is of course to grind up ALL your pods so that its consistent and the same dose will be the same dose every time.

also i like the smalls cause you can just pop em in your mouth and eat them Vary easily ( a little harder to do with Huge Dried ones, cause they are so tough)

and i love eating them; fresh or dried. just like shrooms. its the best way to catch a buzz imo (with GFJ before hand of course)

yeah i know. i havent caught ANY sort of buzz of anny amount of any opiates in SOOOO long i kinda forgot what it feels like. 

i mean back in the day...........i havent had pods for a WHILE!

these days it takes me an entire kilo of the seeds just to get releif, and that amount would kill a normal person. i havent had them for a long time either...just subs.........but yeah i know what you mean tolerance is a BITCH especialy with pods. pods also build it up HUGE and its near impossible to get it back down.......

Thanks for the feedback guys. I know that one size would probably not be more potent than the other I was just curious about if you would actually save any money by ordering a different size. Like does it really come out cheaper (maybe say in weight) if you oreder the jumbo instead of the large or vise versa. But from what I have gathered I will probably just stick with the normal size ones that I have been getting. As I said they are about golf ball size give or take a little for some.


Also I know what you mean about a "whole bucket full" lol. I have been on the pods daily now for about 3 weeks and its ridiculous how much my tolerance has gone up. Really the only way I can catch a good nodding high is if I have been drinking the tea all day (usually on the weekends.) I can make one cup of tea with ten (golf ball size pods) and not really get much out of it. But if I start out in the morning with a cup say maybe mad from 5, and then another in the afternoon and so on near after about 3 cups I'm nodding hard. I still usually make a cup every day after work and I do still get a little euphoria, some relaxation, and the itchies a little bit, but as I said, I need a whole day to really actually get right with them.

Exercise, study, take up a hobby, play computer games, hang out with mates.


Lying in bed all day if you are withdrawal would be absolute hell on your mind, take up bike riding, or going to the gym. Go learn something, go on a trip interstate. Give yourself something to do that doesn't involve sitting at home for the duration of the withdrawal, there will be far less temptation this way.

Like does it really come out cheaper (maybe say in weight) if you oreder the jumbo instead of the large or vise versa. But from what I have gathered I will probably just stick with the normal size ones that I have been getting. As I said they are about golf ball size give or take a little for some.

Really the only way I can catch a good nodding high is if I have been drinking the tea all day (usually on the weekends.) I can make one cup of tea with ten (golf ball size pods) and not really get much out of it. But if I start out in the morning with a cup say maybe mad from 5, and then another in the afternoon and so on near after about 3 cups I'm nodding hard. I still usually make a cup every day after work and I do still get a little euphoria, some relaxation, and the itchies a little bit, but as I said, I need a whole day to really actually get right with them.

Like for instance I just need a cup of tea each morning and i use 5-7 pods a day,depending how the pods look (and i USE nice/BIG ones, i don't hold  back when it comes to opening the wallet for something that's going to be consumed by me & my friends that I show my lil exotic-drug using methods..Cuz u gotta admit those of who use poppy tea and good shit like that know a thing or two bout drugs and all that good shit...Poppy tea is good/ i like a glass around NOON... the tea last forever too...damn like i can go to class and ill nod out, and usually it takes 200+ mgs of OC or like a benzo/opiate mix...ahhh naturals so better too! fuck pills, fuck heroin.. i wouldn't mind raw opium tho..: }

**Finally Free from a 3 month addiction to Pods**


> Its not too hard to quit, keep yourself busy for a few days and it'll be over soon enough. You ever tried to quit?
> 		
> Click to expand...
Hey everyone, like many of you I was addicted to the pods.  I didn't give a fuck if I got addicted so I just used constantly, though I never drank the tea more than once in a day.


Sometimes I would use it 3-4 days consecutively, occasionally I would take a day off to try and regain euphoria (worked for a while, but eventually stopped), and sometimes I would try to taper for a few days (never was able to taper for very long).


I went on like this for 3 months and wasted a lot of money.  After the first month the euphoria went away and it was getting impossible for me to up my dose (I couldn't make a tea with 2 cups of grounds and actually drink it without gagging hardcore).  Everytime I would take a day off I would be severely depressed, the withdrawals just kept getting worse.


Exactly one week ago I ordered bad pods which made me violently ill for several days after I took them and I threw in the towel.  I was terrified of withdrawal after 3 months of use, and it wasn't by any means pleasant, but after about 3 or 4 days I was actually feeling better.


> Whenever I stop, I can't keep busy. I have to lie in bed all day (until about 5PM).  How do you keep busy?
> 		
> Click to expand...
I went to work in my anxiety and ill state and I could barely function.  I have a lot of pain issues as is (arthritis in my feet, knee pain/leg pain) so work isn't easy for me even if I'm not in withdrawal, but I was sitting down like every 30 minutes and feeling really sick.


When I got home I would just lie in bed, partially ill from the bad pods and partially from the CT withdrawal.  I slept very little during these times.


The withdrawals only last about 4 days or so before you start to feel about 75% percent better.  The rest of the 25% seems to take a while but let me tell you getting up and not worrying about the withdrawals for the first time in months was the best high I've ever felt.


Getting into an addicted cycle with these fuckers is easy, but the withdrawals aren't quite as bad you might expect.  Just be strong and know that you will turn the corner!  Things will get better within a couple of days.  I'm around the 1 week mark and I feel 95% normal now.


One last thing then I'll quit rambling:  QUIT AS SOON AS YOU CAN MAKE TIME.  I know people told me the same thing and I ignored it, but you can save yourself a lot of grief and suffering down the road if you bite the bullet sooner than later.  You will be amazed how much better you feel once you break the cycle.


I know I will return to pod tea but I'm going to be much more intelligent about my use and make myself a forced rule of once per week.  Should I have trouble keeping to that, then I will just quit and accept that I can't use them responsibly.


Good luck everyone

**From Poppy pod Tea to Suboxone. **

-How long to wait sense last pod tea dose?


Yo so how long does pod tea last for b4 you start to go into w/d's? I' m wondering this cuz im on pod tea right now and need to get off the pods and back on my sub asap (got test/h.w/classes/ect..) coming up and need to be clear headed. So how long after my last dose of i drank a 9 pod tea brew today (Saturday) around 5pm... im thinking like what? isnt it like 48 hours, cuz pod tea stays in your system and effects you for a good 48hrs?


PS - I also got about 15 1mg xanax (footballs) that I can use for the transition from Pod Tea to my 1st Suboxone dose. 


I've also only been using pod tea for about 4 days now (sense i stopped my sub about 5 days ago, which i was on a dose of 1mg-2mg a day...

**Lemon juice?? Do you need it?**


Two more quick questions:


**Lemon Juice: Do you need it to prepare pod tea?**

Lemon Juice: Do you need to add lemon juice to your pod tea to help with the extraction of the alkaloids or is it just for taste? Because I have never used lemon juice on any my pod tea and it still works fine, **I'm just wondering if Lemon juice actually makes a difference when it comes to making poppy pod tea??** anyone know for sure?


**Last question:**

I got some White Lotus 25x Extract powder (expensive), a bottle of Blue Lotus Liquid Extract 5:1, and a bottle of White Lily Seed Liquid extract 5:1 that I will sometimes add to my pod tea.. 

*

Question is*: Is it OK to add some of the White/blue lotus LIQUID extract to the pod tea? I ask this because both liquid extracts have alcohol in them, the lotus extract is dissolved in alcohol. So will alcohol do anything to the extraction process of the alkaloids if I add some of the liquid lotus extract to my pod tea?

You don't need it at all. It only marginally improves the potency anyway. I don't really notice the difference in potency when using it anyway to be perfectly honest.

You can use the alcohol extract with no problems. Just make sure not to drink so much alcohol that it makes you drunk, even if mildly. This is a sure way to end up overdosing on the pod tea and killing yourself due to the unexpected potentiation of the morphine content in the tea. Most fatal opiate overdoses usually involve alcohol in some form or another. BE CAREFUL!!!

You'll be looking at 2 days totally clean before you are in peak withdrawal. Why get on the sub? why not just kick opiates totally, you can do it man you have the tools and all the support you can get here.


Stock up on some codeine and do a taper with that, it'll be a hellish couple of days, but within a week you'll be almost totally clean.

If anyone else here has tried to quit cold turkey, stagger it and its easier. You don't have to do a taper which can be torture as you want to keep taking more until you get high.


Take 2 days off, then use as you would regularly, then take 3 days off, then 4. and then do a taper with a low grade opiate such as codeine. This will take a while but you won't experience the horrible withdrawals for that long.

i think, yes, when they are ground they become equal under the eye of god and all that...but the psychometric effect is quite prominent..you know like WHOA look at that head-size [human] pod!! 


i have honestly ...and i don't suffer from mental disorders.. except mild GAD which was possibly just a ploy to get into xanax..i'm not even sure anymore , but anyway, ...so i have honestly gotten high while preparing the for-decorative purposes-tea while holding the pods in my hands. sometimes when i shake the dry pods, which i use for decorative purposes because they're exceptionally beautiful as we all know, the rattling of the little decorative seeds inside elicits an opiate-like high in me.....like the pavlov dog and the conditioned stimulus and response. i think some pseudoneurotransmitter drifts to my mu receptors and attempts to get some action potentials going. the effect of this idiocy is so pronounced, that i have actually gotten miosis from it. 


so size does matter...if youre like me and have these pavlovian conditioned highs...the big pod makes you wonder, you know? what would it feel like in me? its throbbing opium goodness.


sorry. 


also, how does one get 'RIPPED'.. from three little atrophied pods? are you in that fertile decrescendo of s.e. asia and afghanistan, uzbekistan, etc and thereabouts? because usually, I don't get RIPPED from three...unless i IV them or something. 


Also,,,,,,I wanted to announce that the poppies I picked in the summer from a public park where children play and dogs frolic and all that....they turned out to be VERY DECORATIVE.....I was amazed. I was not ripped...i was torn in twain...from the beauty. One wonders...what the FAHCK are our urban planners thinking when they decide to plant bushes of extremely decorative papaveri somnifera in a family oriented park in an undisclosed upper middle class neighborhood with many Lutherans running about....where is the logic? Why not just plant a fucking forest full of marijuana trees across the street from a junior  high school...but i stray off topic. 


the point is.....


the point is that.....we should really keep our eyes open if we live in big cities...in the parks, because theyre apparently brimming with all sorts of narcotics and hallucinogens. 


but you have to be quick because for the wildest reasons.. the entire 56 bushes of opium they planted, par exemple, was raped and pillaged of its fruit shortly after my initial three harvests...and I mean someone pulled the mothers out with roots and stones and everything, like a goddamned soviet combine passed over that f-cking park, mainly over the poppy sections of the gardens....


pathetic. its just...i have no words. none whatsoever.

cold turkey is the method of choice for most, because when you have stuff lying around...how the hell are you going to be able to resist putting it to use if you're addicted to it? you gotta have like mad buddhist self-control and be prone to delusional ideation..like jogging in the park at 4 am to obtain a 'natural high' while you 'taper down'. 


please. this tapering nonsense is for the automaton psychiatrists who treat us to recite in calm mental-ward tones. 


i think they key things for successful withdrawal.. are


1. be a man and face the horror. youll go through WD and it will pass...it passes quickly. Keep a positive outlook and preferably, substitute the drug you're tapering from with the euphoriant of choice....preferably, benzodiazepines, which eliminate WD unless you've reached Junkie status...in which case you shouldn't be looking to bluelight for help as you should know exactly what to do. 


2. memantine [Namenda] and to a lesser extent, piracetam. Namenda is an anti-alzheimers drug...but since it has close to zero side effects, it does nothing for alzheimers, but make sure grandma gets a script for it anyway.. because the stuff is very good for reducing tolerances of every sort and eliminating cravings. I've used this stuff and it's proven to be VERY effective. Piracetam is not the same, I hear... Downside is, Namenda is made by Forest Labs and is EXTREMELY INEFFECTIVE as an alzheimer's management drug, thus its very expensive and no insurance will pay for it so make sure you live in a gentrified part of town and have crazy wasp insurance. Psychiatrists will actually give you this stuff if you ask them for it...just tell them youre confused sometimes and namenda helps you be alert and remember your grandson's name in the airport....billy or bobby or whatever his or her name was.

^ yes it is very odd isnt it.


i was most surprised to find out opium poppies are 100% legal in the UK.

"A favourite of the Chelsea Flower Show" (most prestigious)


Even more surprised to find THOUSANDS of them growing ALL OVER my town,

including maybe 80 sq ft of just poppies in a churchyard (man i got high out of that MANY times)

and a block of at least a thousand, just outside of town....

**A great new recipe!**


Ok, so today I tried a new experiment and because it failed it was successful. 


the original intent was an idea I had, to create something called "Honey Pod Pellets". The idea was to ground some pods into powder, mix in some honey with the powder, and then compress the powdered honey goop into marble size pellets to be swallowed.


1st I used about 8 golf ball sized pods. They were broken up, seeds discarded, put into a coffee grinder, and ground down to powder. I placed the powder into a pot with a small amount of water (just enough to completely wet the powder to make it more compressable). The water was then strained using a tea strainer. The powder was pressed with a spoon (while still in the strainer) to expel all remaining water. The water/tea was drank. I then dumped out the powder (which was compressed into a cylinder shape from the strainer). I broke it up a little and mixed in 2 teaspoonfuls of honey. this is where it went wrong. It was not as thick and sticky as I had imagined. It was much to thin to mold into anything. So I tasted it like that and it wasn't bad at all! Hardly bitter anymore. It was sweet and the texture was that of apple butter or jam. It even looked exactly like apple butter.So I put 2 slices of bread in the toaster. Then I spread the "honey pod jam" onto each slice of bread. It was actually good! I really enjoyed it! The goop from all 8 pods fit perfectly on 2 slices of toast.


I know it sounds disgusting but I really recommend trying it. If you can get past the fact that its pods and just think of it as a spread, it doesn't taste bad at all. I actually rather enjoyed the taste.


Just thought I would share this with you guys.

I let soak for about 45 min in 4 cups of water at 193 degrees F. The result was a coffee looking liquid. I strained the plant material and squeezed out all the liquid I could. I put the plant material aside and placed the tea in a pot on an electric stove. Turned the burner on it's lowest setting checked temp and was between 190-193 degrees f.

Here is my 3rd post in my experiment. I got almost 25g of material from 8 tbl spoons of ground poppy powder. After loading the 00 size capsules, I get an average of .5g per capsule. 


I have calculated that under the normal tea conditions, I usually consume about 6g so that "should" equate to 12 capsules per dose. I am working on trying to up the weight of each capsule and hopefully get it to about 1g or 1.5g per capsule.


I'll keep you posted.


The alcohol extraction was interesting as it resulted in a sticky substance. This I think could be smokable but since I am not into smoking, I'm not sure. 


Stay tuned!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

> 1st I used about 8 golf ball sized pods. They were broken up, seeds discarded, put into a coffee grinder, and ground down to powder. I placed the powder into a pot with a small amount of water (just enough to completely wet the powder to make it more compressable). The water was then strained using a tea strainer. The powder was pressed with a spoon (while still in the strainer) to expel all remaining water. The water/tea was drank. I then dumped out the powder (which was compressed into a cylinder shape from the strainer). I broke it up a little and mixed in 2 teaspoonfuls of honey. this is where it went wrong. It was not as thick and sticky as I had imagined. It was much to thin to mold into anything. So I tasted it like that and it wasn't bad at all! Hardly bitter anymore. It was sweet and the texture was that of apple butter or jam. It even looked exactly like apple butter.So I put 2 slices of bread in the toaster. Then I spread the "honey pod jam" onto each slice of bread. It was actually good! I really enjoyed it! The goop from all 8 pods fit perfectly on 2 slices of toast.

I like to see people experiment with different things. Especially if it makes it much more pleasurable of an experience.

I ordered up a bunch of pods recently and have made tea on several occasions, always about a week between uses. I've seen figures of needing about 20-40g of pod material to get off for someone who doesn't use opiates frequently. I haven't touched an opiate in a few months (I just moved so my connections are nil) and I still need 60g of pods to feel anything.


I originally bought these because I thought it would be relatively cheap per dose, but it's starting to not seem that way. It would almost be better to find a hook and pick up a point or two of dope..


Any input? Do you think I just got pods with low potency?

It is hard to get the right dose... Thats the only time having some opiate experience is good.. I just got some giant pods like 3x the size of my fresh picked ones and im gonna make a tea out of 4 of them and sip and wait a few minutes....


Pod potency varies greatly on many factors... 


Usually the bitter it tastes the stronger it is......


But i sip and wait 30 minutes

yea, you got pods with low potency. high potency pods cost more. 


just come around to my area...there's a field of them in the summer. like that scene in the wizard of oz where they go a frolicking through the poppy field and fall asleep in a  narcotic haze.....thats how we do..

well i detoxed myself from pods and am clean now. tbh it was the easiest withdrawal i've ever gone through, but it was also the shortest habit i had. only used for maybe 40 days and usually there would be a break in between some days during the week. not always though. 


only really had 2 days of feeling shitty. about 3 nights of the shooting restless leg pain. i should also add that i have a pretty low tolerance for pain when it comes to withdrawal. usually i'm useless and in a ton of pain, but this wasn't that bad since i could actually walk around at times. i should also note that i've gone through withdrawal from heroin, oxycontin, and methadone about 6 times completely.

It always seems to take me about a year of heavy daily use before I start to develop WD symptoms when I abstain. I must just be unusually lucky.

You think its ok to just leavve it sit in there overnight and drink it tomorrow sometime after most this suboxone has worn off... cuz its weird i can feel effects from the pod tea but i dont think its any of the opiates, i dunno how does Pod Tea compare to breaking threw the suboxone blockade?

Hi I'm new here, have been reading the ENTIRE POD TEA THREAD and I came across this question on suboxone, something I am VERY familiar with. When I first started Suboxone, (I was on it for about 8 weeks before kicking Opiates completely), I had been taking it with great success for about a week, and I came across a stash of 10/325 Percocets that I had misplaced. I was taking, at my peak, about 10-15 of these a day. In any event, when I came across 20 of these as I was doing some cleaning, I was extremely excited, however, about 5 hours before I found these percs, I had taken suboxone. I started by taking a few...3-4 Oxys as I was so excited I found them I couldn't contain myself. Nothing happened. Not a thing. An hour later, I crushd up 3 of them and snorted them (A ritual that I thoroughly enjoy more than anything on this earth) and after that decided to go ahead and eat 3 more. I just assumed my tolerance was still high and that I needed 8 or 10 to get high. Well I ended up going into withdrawals and getting sicker than fuck. I recomend not taking ANY opiate or opiate like substance within 18-32 hours of taking suboxone. I say 18-32 depending on your dose. 


To end my little story, after being sick for about 5-6 hours I felt like everything had exited my system. I was then able to take my remaining percs and have sccess, althouh the effects were milder than usual.

> These are very good points. I'll tell you, I had an opiate pill addiction for a couple years that I kept hidden from everyone. I maintained a 2-4 10/650 hydrocodone addiction at just that, 2-4 a day for about a year and a half. Then I ran into some money. So instead of getting my 2 a day from my dr, and then 2 more a day from my hook up, I stopped going to the dr all together, found the percocet hook up 10/325s (they look just like the yellow norcos but are percs....I as als getting the norcos as well) I went through 75 percs and 75 norcos every two weeks once this money came in. Well that level lasted a month and then I'd be going thru that amount in about 10 days, then got desperate and started snorting heroin. I preferred the clean high of pill form opiates compared to the H, Pills would ALWAYS make me energetic and talkative, where as the H I got would make me rush, and energetic for a bit, but then tired and it would wear off quickly. So I foun the H was cheaper.....3-5 buttons a day cost me 30-40 bucks and that would keep me high all day, but when that pill script came in it was F the H, and get with the pills again. That oxy/hydro mix is amazing. AHEM anyway

> I say all of that to say this. I went from this ridiculous cycle to running out of money....30k pretty quickly and having to go on suboxone. After a week on the suboxone, minus one slip up with oxycodone (percocet), I was able to effectively dose myself down in a very short 2 month time frame (ballpark). I was given the maximum dose of Suboxone, whatever that is, I don't remember, think 8 mg twice a day....but not positive. I took it twice a day for 2-3 days, then after 10 days had tapered down to a half of one per day. I had limited funds and no insurance to buy this stuff, and the dr apt is 200 bucks and the scrip is another 100.

> The point is, you can ween yourself off of opiates no matter how bad the addiction. No matter how fast and furious it comes on and stays, I am a firm believer that tapering is the way to go. I set a date on the calender. Counted out my suboxone, made a schedule and forced myself to stick to it. If you are trying to quit the tea, or any other opiate, i suggest dipping in and out of the sickness and using a less amount each time you allow yourself to dip into sickness. Anybody can put up with dope sickness for 4-8 hours. I know its severe, but thats really how long it takes. Once you are full all out sick for a half a day, and you get that dose, even if its smaller than usual, you will feel like a million bucks. Basically I stretched out a 1 month dose of suboxone to a bit over 2 months, and when I get off it was much easier than the cold turkey I tried about 50 times over the course of my pill addiction.

Now, onto why I'm here. I have read this entire thread, top to bottom because I am getting ready, literally here in the next few minutes to order my first dried poppy pods. My plan is to order about 20 -40 large pods at a time, and when those are gone, go ahead and place the order for more. (that shoud give me about 4-5 days off if I do this right, as I also plan on placing my order on a thursday, and hopefully not recieve it till a monday). Anyway, that is the hope and the plan. I love opiates, and the biggest reason why I quit was the fact that it spun out of control and ended up costing me a shit ton of money. 750 bucks every two weeks on pills and another 250 bucks on H every two weeks goes pretty fast, not to mention the few times I got ripped off on the H and ended up with fake shit. Not sure why that alwas happened to me, but my hook up assumed I ran into a bunch of money and assumed I could afford it, as he would say something like (Yea man, my stash was fucked up too, but ill make it right and discount your next order). When your hooked though, you'll give that motherfucker money 4,5,6 times in a row until he gets your shit right. 


Anyway, I'm so glad to be off of all that, and I cannot WAIT to feel that opiate rush again. While recreationally using opiates, my all time favorite was these 100 mg morphine pills I used to get. I think they were time release, and the funny thing is, I used to make a bit of a tea with them. I'd take 150 mg of morphine sulfate from these pills, eat 75 mg and crush up the other 75, mix it in warm water, a small amount of water, and slam it after soaking it for 10-15 minutes. Wow! That was the ultimate rush. Better than snorting H. Better than snorting 3 buttons at once. (4 buttons and I'd throw up and almost die). 


So I'm venturing into Poppy Pod tea. Somebody a long time ago in terms of time on this thread, but not time in my mind said to add a form of calcium to the tea mix to get more morphine. Then somebody else debunked it. Then somebody else said it worked, and it kind of died off. I am highly interested in gettng the most morphine content from this as possible. So, does the calcium trick work? Are there any other things I can do to up the Morphine content. I know others have asked that same question, but I did not find (at least in this particular thread) a suitable answer that convince me. So let me know whats up, if I order my pods before noon tomorrow they should arrive by Saturday (at least I hope to God they do). Hopefully I have an answer by Friday. 


Oh, (and i hope this is ok to say) on that large auction web site, I have found a couple things that I am considering ordering. I doubt I get an answer in time, since i am ordering before noon tomorrow, but a few questions.  I assume when looking up a distributer, bigger is usually the best bet when it comes to the big online auction site. I assume that the biggest seller is the best. Correct me if I'm wrong.


Next question, Purplish Arizonas? Those any good, any experience with them? They are supposedly 3-4 inches with a purplish hue to them, which I read is a good thing on here. These are "thick walled", is that a good thing? Any help on finding a variety would be appreciated! Thanx, and if this is out of line, I will be on this board for another couple hours, let me know and I'll immediately edit. Thanx!

No the biggest are not the best. Papaver Somnifrem (sp?) is what you need. I'd advise to buy from a website and not on an auction site.

Great contradiction!  So you don't get withdrawals until a year of heavy use (yeah right) but after 4 months of heavy use you have all the common symptoms of withdrawal.  Edit:  Oh heres another

Yep, that would be insanely bad. When my stuff finally comes in, I'll give yall a report.


*edit* by the way, I plan on doing a smaller dose with chugging action. HOpefully to feel a bit of a rush.....but again, don't want to do an insane amount.

I'd just like to warn anyone making the transition from pure poppy tea "liquid" to "liquid with pod grounds" or "just grounds".  I ran out of coffee filters and started using a new method that allows some grounds to get through, resulting in a cloudy liquid.  Well, since using this new method, the tea has become SIGNIFICANTLY harder to take a break from, even just for 2 days.  


I understand that this is common sense, but the degree of difference it has made in the addictive potential is more than I'd have thought.  In fact, I only recently put together that I hadn't stopped drinking the tea daily since switching over, when before I was able to go 4-5 days without even thinking about it.


I get not wanting to be wasteful and all that, but if you haven't started consuming the pod material whole yet, don't.  Just an opinion though.

I am hopeful that if I decide to go on a ppt binge for a few weeks or even a few months, that I can taper down like I did with H and Oxy/hydro (the H use was rare and only when I was out of the Oxy/Hydro)....and then use some Kratom products to really taper off. I do have very good self control as long as when I'm tapering I can control the severest of w/ds. I will call it my ppt to kratom experiment for taking a break from opiates.

i just got some poppy pods and i just used them to make some tea an hour ago. the pods were a bit lighter in color than the ones i have gotten previously and when i broke them up they felt like they were softer or not as dried (crumbly) as the pods i've gotten many times before. i can feel the tea, but i feel like they are less potent than the dryer ones i've had. i know pods can vary in potency but does the extent to which they were dried effect the potency of the pods?

**purple/grey poppy pods**


I looked through the mold on pods threads but no one really touched this exactly.  I had mostly pods with absolutely nothing on the outside but then had some with purpleish/ grey exteriors and some with small black spots. are these ok?

If I can help one person, than its worth it


DO NOT CONSUME/EAT/DRINK anything made from these pods!!!!!!!!!!!!!


I dunno, the one time I had the same type of weird-ish insides of poppys, and an OVERLY earthy smell, I had a violent, horrid headache for 3 days. I'm talkin "I think I've been poisoned".........of course I didn't really wanna goto the ER and explain that I had a batch of bad pods.


Don't fuck with it. If you already have, good luck mate. I was gobbling up T3's and Advil trying to get rid of the pain.

I haven't used pods in over 3 weeks. The last 4 times I used them I vomited(small doses too)

It was bad puking, I would puke and feel ever shittier after I puked than before.


So my question is, what's the best OTC for nausea?

I eat the pods instead of making tea.....would tea decrease my chances of nausea?

Yeah, make a tea and add some ginger or peppermint, both of which are potent anti-nausea herbs.


Dramamine is the only anti-emetic that comes to mind that's OTC, and maybe Benadryl if you feel the nausea is allergy-related.  A good dose of candied ginger, fresh ginger tea, or even powdered ginger added to your tea is the best remedy I can think of.  I take Claritin-D 45 minutes prior to having tea, then add plenty of ginger, which aids with the nausea.  If I fail to take the antihistamine, my shoulders hurt, my eyes get all gooey, and I feel more nauseous than when I do take it, so don't underestimate the power of the histamine release caused by opiates as the cause for your side effects.

I never can tell whether the black, gooey drops on my pods/stems are opium that leaked out or some weird kind of mold.  It looks like black tar, isn't fuzzy, and has no smell, but my extreme sensitivity to mold makes me discard them every time.

small black spots like you would find on (biological) fruit would be ok


anything furry or moldy if thats what  you mean  by dust is a danger to your health even breathing the air in it's vicinity is dangerous. There are also black spots which are mold , may i ask how you got/ stored these pods if they havent been wet or dryed under bad circumstances i cant see how they got moldy.

Anything with promethazine or diphenhydramine. They are both opiate potentiators and will make you drowsy, so adjust your dose accordingly.

WRONG. Purple colouration is completely natural and happens in some strains when technically ripened, and it is accentuated when dried. The grey is just the purple pod aged. Black spots are sometime due to a harmless mold but more often than not simply mildew due to environmental factors.


Unless purposely contaminated there is nothing dangerous happening with Somni.

As long as the tea is coming out any color other than clear, I think it's safe to assume you're getting something out of it. Whether or not it's worth it is a completely different issue, though. Keep in mind that old, wet, soggy pod grinds don't stay "fresh" for very long...


But hey who knows, maybe the mold you ingest could add to the high? Someone on here is crazy enough to try it, we'll found out eventually.

i usually do 3 washes with the same grounds. all at once of course because it turns to shit pretty quickly. i dunno if it is worth it really because the third glass is much lighter and not strong tasting at all but i get paranoid thinking im losing a good amount of it ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


i've done 4 washes too with a higher amount, and i know i got something out of the third that time

I can be somewhat wasteful and not even do the second wash.


I always put it in my fridge and end up throwing it out before I use them for a second wash.

rewashing pods is IMO not of much benefit. I can hardly feel anything using even 5 times as much rewashed pod as I would normally use.

I just finally came to the conclusion it's a waste of time. Also eating the straw does very little over a good tea IMO.

the best way to do pods to get the most bang for your buck is to eat them. it takes half as much product when eaten as it does to make a tea to get the same effect.


i personally grind mine into a very fine powder, mix with grapefruit juice, and chug it. not nearly as much liquid as tea, and ALOT more pleasant. (i seriously don;t see how people drink tea....i've tried alot of diff methods of helping the taste and nothing really helped)


you could also get some gel caps and a pill filler thing off of amazon for very little cash. i think right around $20 would get you the filler and a thousand gel caps. the process looks pretty messy, but if you can;t stand the taste there ya go.


(w00t, first post! lotsa good info in this thread...actually got me to register ^^)

I like the quick onset of tea and long duration of grounds. So, I make tea, drink it, do a second wash, drink that. Then I mix grounds in yogurt (about half of what I use for tea), eat that and wash it down with gf juice. It hits me within 10-15 min, peaks in an hour or two, then lasts and lasts.


I like to drink Kava when I'm coming down. It brings the high back.

how is a mix of grinds and yogurt? can you taste them at all? i really like yogurt but hate the taste of pods soooooo much i'm not sure about trying to eat them that way.


i'm gonna go ahead and buy one of those capsule filler things and some gel caps next weekend. i'll post about the experience here. from the looks of the thing it seems like it might get REAL messy...but i would much rather pop a bunch of pills than force grinds/tea down my throat.

yeah let us know how it goes hi5555


anyone tried this method ?

Basically you just grind the pods in a coffee grinder but then you put the powder into a blender with hot water and and blend it on a low setting for a minute or so.  Sounds like it would work alot better than just letting it seep because it would constantly be agitated.

Well pods haven't been working for me since I started albeit a little. But my secret is to drink 3 washes straight away and drink. This my way of getting a little euphoria. The last pods used were hens & chickens and really small so I used 20 and after the third wash, got were I needed to be. 


Maybe I'm not leaving it long enough in the water or using to little but I'll stay with this method for now. Happy days.

BTW can anyone help me with any input as to why I only get high on the third wash?


Am I not using enough water to begin with as I only get say a cup full at first? So should I use more water?


Or is it that I'm just getting more alkaloids from the three washes, I'm sure that this is not the case as the third wash yeilds less alkaloids yes?


Thanks for any input.

^^ dj25 probably there is something wronh with the way you prepare it ,dont forget the more material you use the more water you should use you will get a feel for it better too much than too little


if thats not the cause then its dosage related usually a second wash is only 1/3 to 1/2 the potency of the first one,so i suspect you are not using enough water or not heating or steeping enough

how many pods are you using? if im using 4-5 pods then i use 1.75 cups on the first wash, then 1.25 then a cup. better to use too much than too little.


and how do you know your only getting high on the third wash? do you mean after you drink that then you feel your high 30 minutes later? cause i usually can get each wash down and then feel myself getting really high after its all gone. i still feel it cmoing on after the first wash though

if your using 10-12 large i would use 3 cups for the first wash, 2 for the second and 1.5-2 for the third. 


i think using more for the first wash is better. after that it seems you dont need as much because the grounds are wet.


generally i follow the rule of a cup for 3-4 pods, 1.5 for 5-7 and 2 for 8-10. thats for the first wash. with the second wash i usually drop half a cup and t hen another .25 for the third. i cant stand drinking all that liquid though because usually i cant piss for hours and im super full of liquid and have to pee so bad

I will recommend a very effective method for making capsules quickly/efficiently with a powdered material.


Purchase two of the Cap-M-Quick "00" capsule fillers. Purchase one "00/000" tamper.


Use a material that is ground to the consistency of baby/talcum powder. A coarse grind/powder will not pack as well/efficiently.


Place the large end of the capsules in one of the fillers, with the rotating 'spacers' used to space the top and bottom of machines. Use the 2nd machine to place the small half of the capsule on. Do not use the 'spacers' on this machine, they will be too high for the small capsule end. Instead, fold a piece of cardboard and place it between the ends of each side of the filler that you use for the small capsule ends. Pour powder and spread, filling the short capsules and tamping down. Do not add more to the small capsule ends. Now, add and spread powder to the large halves, tamper, then repeat until no more will fit in the lower large capsule halves. Now you can assemble the caps. With the tampered/packed material in both tops and bottoms using 2 machines, you will get about 0.6 grams per "00" capsule. With no tamping and using a single machine, about 0.3 grams per "00" capsule is normal. With one machine and tamping, about 0.45 grams is normal per "00" capsule. Using 2 machines and tamping both sides will get you the same density as professional made capsules and this reduces the number of capsules you have to swallow. FYI, a 'Giant' size pod is approx. 4 grams of dried material with stem and seeds discarded. I do recommend "00" capsules. You can swallow two at a time easily.  FYI, the average size capsule found in over the counter products is usulaly "0", which is a bit smaller than the size I am recommending. The larger size, "000", is nearly horse pill sized and may be difficult for some people to swallow. But if you can handle it, go for it. LOL! Note: Some people report finding that capsuled material does not work as well as free swallowed material. I can only guess that either the capsule is not fully dissolving for some people, leaving the produce partially clumped together internally, or that these people are imagining things. I don't know which is true.


-Chris


***Note: **I am not recommending using any illegal substance in the gel capsules. The above procedures work to optimize the packing time and density of ANY powdered material. Specific mass units given above are averages, and may deviate based upon specific materials and their specific mass.*

thanks for the reply Madwolf...will def keep it in mind.


once again, how are peoples experiences using yogurt to mask the taste of grinds?


 my normal dosage is around 15-25 grams depending on what i have to do for the day...and unfortunately every time i have used pods the taste has gotten worse and worse. its to the point that i can;t handle them at all, and using gel caps is gonna be my last ditch effort. i guess i can just try yogurt for myself but was looking for someone who has tried it to explain how well it worked.

**Pod Tea Potency Enhancement**


Does anyone out there have any tried and true methods of increasing tea potency? I myself add calcium carbonate and lemon juice. I have found that the calcium does increase the potency, and the lemon juice seemed to extend the length of the high, but didn't seem to increase the level. I've read of a further process which converted the base morphine into 6-monoacetylmorphine, but the process itself and the chemical used was omitted. Further research mentions acetic acid, but as to it's use in the process I have no idea. Any experienced users with advice would be greatly appreciated.

Can you find these anywhere else than on ebay?  It seems that retailers go out of their way to make sure they don't have the p. somniferum variety.  


I guess I could try the seeds from a bulk supplier, but the pods sound better to me.  The bulk seeds don't sound very promising...

No, the data you're seeking doesn't exist. If you've been doing pods you probably know that the potency of them isn't consistent. It's best to grind up a lot at once and mix it well so what you have is uniform in potency.

There's never going to be any hard data. It's like asking how much THC is in a weed bud. Sure, knowing the strain helps, but only by so much..

BodhiSvaha33 & CloudyHazeD, if you want to get the maximum amount of potency, can't you just grind up your pods and eat them raw (straight up). Or mabye with some milk or yogurt.

Ahhh, but then Tchort supplies links to papers I was hoping people would find on their own (so that it would actually matter to them). Anyway,good post but to the OP, the answer as I have said time and again is NO, there is no one variety of Somniferum (or Setigerum) that consistently provides more morphine. Consistency is only vague in terms of morphine content but is related to growing technique and to enviornmental conditions.

You can use a bank account through Paypal, and the seller knows nothing about your bank account, the transaction goes through paypal. Pretty safe in regards to transaction security, you have to confirm your account yourself,  I've made transactions over a hundred times and no worries. ebay search a dried pod inquiry, and many sellers actually confirm they are selling somniferums.

**How to make poppy pod tea less bitter**


Anyone have any good tips? I just got a fresh batch and these pods are the most bitter I've ever had.  Can't take more than a small swig every few minutes and even then its everything I can do to not puke. Never had this issue before in the past...maybe these are just really strong pods.

I usually add a LOT of sugar and mix about 1:1 with orange juice, apple juice, lemonade, etc. You can't ever make it taste good, but you can make it easier to get down.

Thanks for the advice, I'll go try mixing it with some OJ. I did dump a bunch of sugar in already...didn't help. It's weird that none of my pods ever tasted this horrible before, maybe I finally found some potent ones!

Try cranberry juice. It masks it, and might help with potentiation.

interesting newmoon, i'd like to see some evidence of this...not saying you're lying...just would like to see some evidence.  Yeah....to the OP, or you could just stop being such a pussy and just drink the crap?  I can just stomp on the pods in a bag, breaking them up, eat them raw, chasing with water to help swallow...I find this gets me the most f'd up.  Seriously though.... and cranberry juice for potentiation? Lol..do some research... This site has all teh answers for you already my friend.  Try GRAPEFRUIT JUICE along with some CIMETIDINE pills.  


And in regards to what newmoonrecords said: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miraculin) ....sounds great actually..although stomaching this stuff...oh yeah, gelcaps.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  ..wait, you could just cook down the pod water into puddy and gel cap it?

The bitterness is usually okay with me.


What always set off my gag reflex was those little particles at the bottom of the glass.  ALways set me off for some reason.

got a couple questions. 


I made some tea last night, about 10 hours ago. just drank the first glass and am wondering if it probably lost any potency or if its like i just made it. 


also, my last batch of pods had some that were dark in color and weren't crisp at all. i didn't use them and dont really plan on it but are they still good or garbage? one of them was almost black.

Dark color and lacking crispness means the pods were moldy, I'd toss those.

**Flower inside poppy pod**


Hi everybody


I just got a new batch of pods that I ordered. I broke few of them and I found some kind of weird flower growing inside. I never saw that before...


Are it's safe to consume ? Are they still pappaver somiferum ?? Anyone see that already ?


Thank you

Well it sure looks nice when you're trying to get there... and it's even a nice place to visit and vacation. Once you move to podville and you've lived there for a while, trust me... it's not so nice.

its not a pod if it has a flower in it , it's a bud , normallly they open up then petals come out , after a week or so they fall off and it starts transforming into a pod

the first time i tried pods, about 10-11 months ago, i couldn't drink the shit at all. tried mixing it with EVERYTHING and just couldn't get it down. 


now i just hold my nose and chug once its cold. chase with grapefruit juice because its so strong it takes away any taste. make sure you dont breathe in your nose untill you've had 2 sips of GFJ or you'll taste it. 


getting it cold makes it a lot easier. i find now that i get excited if the first wash is really bitter, or more so than last time. means im probably gonna be wasted ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I can't really get the second down as easy all the time because im full of tea and just trying to chug more when i can't makes me gag sometimes and i have to wait 30 mins to an hour

Exactly, the more bitter, the better the brew.


I don't get why so many people have trouble with the taste. It's not bad at all IMO. 


Just man up and chug it.

I cant really drink it if i dont hold my nose. being somewhat cold helps a ton too. if i hold my nose though i can chug it until my stomach is full.

I'm sure anything not used properly bites back 10 X fold.  


There doesn't seem to be that many vendors on e-bay, one got seized not so long ago... the various sites as well as the ebay sellers all tout that it's not for consumption so I'm losing interest real fast.  


I'll just count my blessings when pharms come around at a reasonable price, and hope I can afford to travel sometime in the near future.

Anyone who buys pods has access to thousands of seeds![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png), and I've found that they grow like crazy. Living in the city could make planting hard, but a trip to the countryside could prove "therapeutic" for many people! 2 or 3 times a year, once in the winter, once in the spring, then once to see the leaves change8).

Ya they would have to state it's not for consumption.  It just makes me wonder if some of them have some sort of agreement with the cops to neutralize the active contents somehow.


I guess those who have lots of positive feedback might be a safer bet than professional looking websites that have been operating for a long time.

There's no deal with the cops, they're just covering their asses.  Anyone smart enough to bother putting that warning in their terms and agreements is likely selling the real deal.  Why would a professional looking website be less reliable?

I buy pods from a lang standing seller, with lots ( and I mean over 10,000 ) of feedback, ( One of which stated "the tea rocks! "LOL, the seller missed THAT edit!) and haven't been disappointed yet. I also notice that out of the hundreds of pods I have bought, there is very little variation in potency. And yes, I assume that is from uniform growth and the pods being the sellers standard stock.

Hey, I know some of this has been gone over before but I figured I'd ask a few questions at once. Do you guys recommend the larger pods or medium/small pods? 


I think at most sellers you can get a better deal per gram of pod buying the smaller pods, but is there a direct correlation between the potency in the size or the pods?


Also I know this is close to sourcing, but would you guys recommend auction sites for getting pods as opposed to devoted websites? I've noticed there is a large price difference in favor of the auction sites.

I buy medium large pods, don't know if there is a potency dif between small and jumbo. I know the larger ones go for more, I assume that is because they are more sought after for true floral arrangements. Most big auction sites have their own web site as well outside the auctions. I use one auction site, they are reliable and honest. Got ripped a couple of times before them, but found a good one and stuck with them for a year now. Their BIG, can't miss 'em.

I always opt for the mammoth pods.  I find that the little ones require so many per batch that they're actually more expensive per dose, plus they're much more of a hastle to prepare than a few big ones.

Dude, no worries. Pods are legal, and delivered in discreet packaging. My mail lady delivers them to my front door, out in the middle of nowhere! Their worth it, and I will never go back to pill-popping like I used to. $100 of pods will last me a 2-3 weeks, $100 of pills will last me 2 or 3 days. Plus, I don't worry about getting busted fed style with a pocket of illegal scrips. Local pigs here don't know what pod tea is, but they know their Oxys! AND, I have flowers all over the woods now, won't have to buy pods by next fall![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)!


PS Lollerskater, I'm gonna order some mammoths, I want to test your theory. Hope it works!

^^ Actually... I'm pretty sure pods are *technically* illegal. Correct me if I'm wrong. I know ebay sellers have been busted in the past. In fact, even though I'm sure it wouldn't happen, those poppies growing on your property are illegal as well (if you live in the US).

According to state and federal laws, they are illegal. But, you can find them growing in almost every state, in floral shops across the country, and in old neighborhoods everywhere. Most cops have no idea what they are, though. Hell, there are poppys growing around my local courthouse! I happen to live in a very remote area, and I grow them in flower beds with numerous other flowers. They also happen to grow all over the hills in my area for some reason8). If you scatter them out in small plots, it's easy to go unnoticed. They spring back up, year after year too! They grow in shitty soil, need little water. Just be smart.

Ummmm.... ok?


Most people are fairly safe ordering and growing them, but it's not good to tell people they are flat out legal when apparently, you already knew they weren't.

**I know, Sorry, it's confusing!**


They grow in every state, nurseries sell them as ornamentals, you can buy the seed at flower shops, on the internet, and garden centers, and they can be found in old neighborhoods everywhere. My grandmother had hens and chicks in a flower bed in her yard, and her friends grew various colors of P.somniferum. I've checked the laws, and they are VERY confusing. Poppys have this quasi-legal status ( only term that seems to apply! ), in one aspect their legal and another they are not. I can and have gone to a floral supply house not far from me and bought them over the counter, tax and all, for arts and crafts ( too expensive! ). I bought 3 plants from a local nursery, potted and perfect. The only thing I know for certain is that if you score the plants ( cut the pods to obtain opium ), you just committed a federal violation. The cuts are very visible, they turn blackish quickly. But most cops have no clue, a friend of mine is the sheriff of my county, and he has been to my home numerous times and has seen my flower beds, my garden, and all he sees are flowers and vegetables! Hell, we sat on my patio with dozens of types of flowers around us, incuding poppys, drinking beer, and no worries. I stay under the radar, discreet, and keep it to myself, and have had no problems. If your smart and keep it low profile, it's fairly easy. So, if you speak legalese better than me, check out the laws and see if you can make any sense of them! I've tried.

^ Yes, parachuting is really no different to just swallowing it. If it works swallowed, then it'll work wrapped up in a bit of paper.

Eh, it takes long enough for the pod powder to dissolve in your stomach based on what I've read. People report that you get less of a peak this way because not all of it gets absorbed at once. Parachuting isn't worth it with pod powder IMHO. Only do it if it makes it easier to get the shit down. It would work for that purpose and the effects/onset time would be about equal to swallowing it. The onset might be slightly slower. Your stomach acids can easily eat through tissue paper, but it could take a few minutes.


Eating pod powder ensures you're getting 100% of the morphine, however preparing tea can give you a stronger peak that comes on quicker. The onset time is a huge factor when it comes to addiction and drug preference. People sub-consciously like things that give them instant gratification. I think it's very non wasteful to eat entire ground pods, but the couple times I tried it, I felt I was missing the peak. It was also hard to get down much of the powder.

Eating the grounds works fine, but just be a man and chug that shit! Trust me, if you chug and chase it for awhile, it will start to become bearable. You might even start to like the taste one day... that will be the day you know you have a problem =)

I just ordered 20 P.S. pods from an auction house, jumbo 5 inches or larger. I am only on page 16 of this thread. Hopefully I will have finished it before the pods get here so Ill have all this good information jotted down. I have a food processor. Will that work to power the shells? Im planting all the seeds I find inside. I don't have a coffee maker so I am trying to decide whether to eat, 'chute powder, make tea or enema the tea. Please comment. By the time I get back to this page I will have my pods and need all your opinions.  I was with two friends last night, both freebasing tar, and both flat NOT allowing me to try it once. Both seemed to love their tar, and both act like dickheads without it, but both tell me they will never sell to me nor allow me to use. They don't want me to go through what they go through. But the high looks fine as hell, so I am going to find out about it this way. My normal use of opiates is limited to one 80 oxycontin a weekend.

This is pod-related so I figured I'd just add it to this thread to avoid a UTFSE-type response.  


I've noticed that when I'm in the withdrawal period from my pods, all I do is sleep.  I can sleep up to 24 hours straight, probably more, with some of the weirdest dreams ever.  I'll occasionaly wake up feeling cold and sweaty and nauseous, but am too tired to do anything but sleep.  There's no puking or diarrhea, just moderate nausea, cold sweats, and runny nose. 


From what I've read here, it seems that sleep is the LAST thing a person in opiate withdrawal can do, especially for such long periods of time.  How rare is it to sleep through your withdrawals?  I drink pod tea like 4-6 days a week, with about 4-6 pods per glass or 1 1/2 jumbos with no breaks, and have done so for about 4 months (pretty binge-y, I know).  But even when I used to have just one glass of tea one day a week when I first started, I'd get this extreme fatigue/cold sweats when the tea wore off.   Just curious how many other people get ungodly exhausted during withdrawals.

I get ridiculously fatigued, but I have difficulty sleeping solid.  The godawful cold sweats and bone aches wake me up every hour or two.  I don't have any puking or nausea either (though that could be because I tend to smoke a LOT of pot when I'm out of pods), so your wd sounds normal to me.  Count yourself lucky that you can get a good night's sleep.

Well, I do not just snort back 80 at a time. I generally grate up and line half a pill, then after a few hours... more or less depending on the activity I'm doing... I grate up and line the other 40g. I don't take 80 up my nostrils like a G. I'm just purely recreational. Do you still think that will affect my tolerance to the tea? The more you talk to me the better off I will be. 


and in other news, freebased heroin for the first time today. I only took maybe 3 hits. I'm used to smoking weed, so THAT shit was harsh as fuck. I don't feel very high though. I only wanted to give it a whirl so that I can compare it to the pod tea. Please continue to advise... I am up to page 20 in this thread.

I disagree with the whole "you won't be able to get very high from pod tea" sentiment if you use one OC 80 on the weekends here and there.  I've even seen hardcore H users on this site say they get blasted off some pod tea, and some people prefer it to pills.  It's more about personal preference than potency.


Pod tea tends to give a more steady, long lasting sedating opiate high, whereas pills give more of a short-lived euphoria.  That's not to say that pods aren't euphoric, but the high is more visual, almost psychedelic for me than pills, and lasts much longer.  You're very relaxed, but don't typically fall asleep or feel fatigued with pods, and it's more of a body high.  Like an indica (pods) compared to a sativa (pills) strain of weed.  If you have any other questions feel free to pm me.

And yes, pod tea can get you as high as an oxy 80. It's just a different high.

I've read about a lot of people saying that they do nothing but sleep during the WD's, I personally might sleep a lot the first night (usually because pod tea seems to keep me a bit stimulated and awake) but after that Insomnia becomes one of my least favorite withdrawal effects.


I feel tired like I should be able to sleep but try as I might sleep is difficult.  Sometimes I'll wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep, that sucks too.

^ You can add sugar to your tea if you like and the effectiveness won't be affected. But you'll just end up with a very bitter tea with a layer of sweet over it. 


The easiest way to get it down I've found (and I have way more experience with pods than I'd like!), is to either wait for the tea to cool down and chug, or pour it over ice and chug. Getting the tea really cold makes it a helluva a lot more palatable to me.

Something that works for me: mix your tea with a bit of cranberry juice.  The cranberry takes a lot of the edge off the bitterness. 


As far as other sweet stuff goes, I've yet to find any sweetener which can mask that distinctive "ass washed in ass" taste of poppy tea.

I used to think that too, but now that I'm a bit more seasoned, I actually like it better warm. No idea why.


Best method I've found is to steep it with a tea you like and mix it with grade B maple syrup. It works better for sweetening than sugar or honey IMO.


That said, if you develop a habit, you will get used to the taste. Wife and I rarely even use a chaser anymore. If you had told me I wouldn't be using a chaser 6 months ago, I would have slapped you in the face.

Hmm, cranberry sounds interesting... neat suggestion.  My stomach was upset and I haven't been able to keep much food down, so today while my tea was hot I added some Mint Meadley teabags and it totally masked the earthy taste of the pods.  I think I may do that more often.

ok so i did poppy pod tea for my 4th time yesterday (in bout 3months)


i crushed up 7 pods and drank it.


then about 1hour later crushed up another 4 pods and drank that.


I felt extremely itchy, i was constantly itching and couldnt urinate. But I didnt feel that high to be honest. I felt the slightest bit floaty but not so much warm as everyone describes and I certainly didnt get any rushes from it. However I had a feeling of contentness which kinda let my mind have  arest from thinking. Had a nice sleep and felt in a positive mood today.


Does poppy pod tea get better the more times you do it? As with alot of drugs Ive found they dont get good until you've experienced and recognise the high a couple of times.

^You might have just had some lower quality pods.  When I've been out for a while, my first dose doesn't usually get me high-- I guess the buildup in my system from the long half-life makes subsequent doses much more fun.


I found out the hard way that moldy pods are fucking horrible.  I had discovered a moldy one after I'd already broken part of it up to grind, and although I tossed most of it away I didn't dig out the pieces that were in the grinder.  Bad mistake.  I spent the last two days unable to keep anything down and constantly walking around with that overly-wet mouth that precedes vomiting.  Retard that I am, it took me two days to put two and two together and figure out what the issue was.  I totally underestimated just how bad a teenie bit of mold can fuck your system up.

Heh, most of the time I just tell myself it's really bitter coffee and add a shitload of sugar.  I've been drinking it for over 6 months though now, off and on.  Try as I might I can't quit the shit... all I every do is suffer until my tolerance comes down a bit and I get wasted again.


> I felt extremely itchy, i was constantly itching and couldnt urinate. But I didnt feel that high to be honest. I felt the slightest bit floaty but not so much warm as everyone describes and I certainly didnt get any rushes from it. However I had a feeling of contentness which kinda let my mind have arest from thinking. Had a nice sleep and felt in a positive mood today.

It's very subtle, it may well be that you just aren't used to the effects yet.  That constant itch and inability to urinate shows that you got morphine containing pods for sure though.  I do note a warm feeling that spreads through my body when I drink it.


> Does poppy pod tea get better the more times you do it? As with alot of drugs Ive found they dont get good until you've experienced and recognise the high a couple of times.
> 		
> Click to expand...


That was the case for me I think... I used to use Kratom and LOVED IT.  Oddly enough, the first time I tried pods I wasn't very enthused.  But then I tried again, and again.  I am in a lot of physical pain so I sort of told myself it was okay to go ahead and get addicted...


I can tell you now that after many months of addiction and voluntary withdrawal that I unfortunately love the pods much more than ever.  Whatever you do, don't get into that cycle my friend.


The thing is, once you start to get a taste for the high and really enjoy it, you might start to take solace more and more and end up somewhere you don't want to be.

Wow, that mold can really mess things up I guess.  I use a box cutter to open up my pods (lol, very stupid, I've cut my fingers 3 or 4 times in the past week) and I think just getting some mold on my blade may have been enough to taint the next pod I opened, because I got sick.


I have a question though, I know you guys dont use pods that are moldy (black and hairy and smell like death inside) but do you guys ever encounter pods with all the seeds a dark brown color and stuck on the wall of the pods?  Sometimes I pitch those away too, but maybe they're just immature seeds or something?  They definitely look different than a truly moldy pod.

If it's just that the seeds are brown, I keep it.  But if they stick to the inner walls of the pod then it's probably just starting to mold, in which case I'd toss it.  I like when I find the little flower inside pods though, feels like a fortune cookie.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I like my tea hot or warm with powdered ginger and a flavored tea bag of some sort (like pomegranate green tea or jasmine green).  I try to bypass my tastebuds altogether by chugging it fast and chasing it with water and either coffee or another strong drink like hot chocolate.  No need to let it sit there on the tongue and let your brain process the taste if it makes you nauseous!


And yes, consuming moldy ANYTHING can be extremely dangerous.  If you're allergic or sensitive to mold or have asthma, they can set off some horrid gastrointestinal/bronchial reactions.  Some strains of mold are highly toxic, which means they're dangerous to everyone (you needn't be allergic to be affected.)  Some molds, like the aflatoxins, are known to cause cancer in humans (aflatoxin is considered a huge cause of liver cancer, by the way).  It can be tough to tell mold from discoloration, black goo from bug bites and other piercing objects, and stuck-on seeds.  If it's furry, smelly, or extremely dark-colored, I discard it just to be safe.  Mold can be every color of the rainbow, from white to grey to brown/black to fluorescent orange. Then again, sometimes the seeds appear to be mixed in with tiny brown "seed covers" and stuck to the sides of the pod, in which case I usually use it.  


It's a tough call, but if you consistently get pods that appear questionable, you should consider switching vendors.  My old source used to give me around 5-10 "iffy" pods per order, which just wasn't cost effective, so I switched.  Now I only get 100% perfect pods, large, round and free of mold, which is the way it should be.  If this is going to be something you're gonna be doing for the long run, ingesting pesticides, molds, and other contaminants is simply unacceptable.

So would it be best to crush them all to powder first~?

Can the powder still turn mouldy?

I've plugged the tea a few times with pretty nice results, but I was curious if one could also plug finely filtered powder mixed into water.  I'm sure that like when taken orally, that the come on would be a lot slower, but does it have fairly decent overall BA?

OMG


So I was pretty bored and well I've found that you can get a high or something from these pods in making tea... (wish I new about this earlier).


Anyway, I've never had these pods before, opium or any pain killer (panadol only) so my tolerance would be very low.


Unfortunately I have no idea what pods look like or where to get them and am not really interested in finding out where to get any but I also read you can have "poppy seed tea". Where you go to the supermarket and buy these poppy seeds and make tea out of it, I have the recipe.


So a few questions please:


Could you please give me some tips and tricks I could use when making this tea? 

Are they just the black poppy seeds you buy at the local super market for baking cakes with?

How many grams of poppy seeds should I use?

How long till I feel the effects?


Sorry if this sounds stupid but this cheap high sounds to good to be true (even though it is) and am very curious about it all before I try it in a few hours.


Cheers!

Good seeds are hard to come by. Most are washed, which takes away what you want. Try an organic/health food store. If you a first timer, try washing a pound and see what a glass or two does. Start light, and if it doesn't get you where you want to go, get a littler heavier in your dosage, but BE SAFE. Better a half assed buzz and alive than stoned to death!![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)And yes, they are just breadseed poppys, right in the spice aisle of any grocery store.

1) Absolutely. The finer the powder, the greater the amount of surface area which is exposed to the water and the more efficient the extraction of morphine and other alkaloid goodies.


2) I would presume the powder could still turn moldy if stored in damp conditions... but I've never left any lying around long enough for that to happen ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I'm just gonna quote myself from another thread.  I didn't feel like typing it twice, and there's an extraction process for extracting a smoke-able product from dried pods for those who are interested.

> I've been looking all over the interwebs for a fairly easy pod extraction and can't find anything that yields a smoke-able final product. (besides the link below)

> There was part of a tek someone described in the big and dandy pod thread but i don't feel like reading through 20 something pages for an incomplete tek. but from what i remember, apparently by adjusting pH, morphine freebase will precipitate out of the solution then it's just evap-ing, or turning it into its salt form. if anyone knows this tek please share (not the vague and complicated tek that is on the shroomery and other sites). I'm positive that if there was a simple tek that yielded a product of decent purity, junkies everywhere would rejoice.

The mold causes a much stronger high.  Go for extra thick, dark mold.  Really adds a fleshy, excellent taste as well.![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

You're from Australia. There are places you can find poppy seeds that will work, the supermarket ones won't really do the trick most of the time. There are some who have had quite bad reactions to the supermarket variety in fact, possibly because of a high thebaine content.


I suggest you check out the poppy seed tea thread in Australian Drug Discussion for a regional specific thread which may assist you in getting experiences and suggestions. 


As for poppy pods, yes they are very hard to find in this country; I managed to get my hands on them once and that was very lucky.

So the other day I went to the bakery and asked for 300 grams of poppy seeds as they didn't have any in the store, the women working just gave me a weird look, I went on to tell her I was cooking a heap of muffins... haha.


Anyway, I made it into poppy seed tea and it worked, well I found it hard to walk, was slow in re acting to things, kinda just really spaced out, so all in all it was pretty good.


BUT BUT BUT


The next morning I woke up with this HORRIBLE HORRIBLE head ache, like realllly bad, so I put up with it all day and then last night I went back to bed. Usually when I have a head ache and wake up it usually is gone by the next morning.


This morning I woke up and it was still there, same pain as yesterday, I have had heaps of asprin but it doesn't want to go away! Aghhhhhhh


Could this be some serious side affect? Or am I over re-acitng?


thanks!

I've heard of headaches as a side-effect of too much morphine or other opioids... but a two day headache from seed tea? I haven't heard of that before. Instead of aspirin, have you tried APAP or ibuprofen?

**Smooth pods**


I've been running across a lot of smooth pods mixed in with the purple tazmanias. I've never seen pods as smooth as these are. They are basicly the same shape, just have a smoother shell. Not quite as mottled as the tasmanias. Anybody have any experience with these? Overall, everything seems to be much weaker than usuall. I don't know if it's because of a growing tolerance, or maybe these smooth pods aren't really p somniferums?

To prevent being merged I figured I would post my findings/inquiry here.  Anyway I may have stumbled upon a new topic of interest here, among all topics from consumption, extraction, cooking, taste, etc. As I was saying, being aware of pesticides, possible potency issues, and Pods ws. Seeds preference...almost everything possible has been attempted during the study of these little jokers by this poppie mad scientist I know.  

To the point, while down in the laboratory the other day, he was in the middle of checking this batch of left over Pod seed tea that he had in the refrigerator.  Being as though he had already cooked(thank goodness) and was running low on Pod resources, he opened a batch of emergency stash to drink.  While looking down into the white plastic container, he noticed floating on top of the now settled black seeds was the usually expected milky/transparent fluid.  Anyway, before shaking(re-straining)the tea for possible consumption he ran across a "little treasure"![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)...(Walla!!)miniscule, dead , white larva that had floated to the top of the undisturbed black seeds.  Yes!!  Fucking discusting, no other way to put it.

Any other peeps familiar with such?  Have a pretty good idea they are in them all, maybe not grocery store, pod products.  New to me but just thought I would share the info obtained.  Maybe peeps should think about the temp. they make their Pod/Seed tea, or cold water extracts period, or maybe even pluggin'(just doesn't settle right with me, pluggin' worms up my ass)...atleast Quervo(alcohol) kills the worm germs. Hah! And peeps are worried about the taste!!

I've only had 3-4 moldy pods in my batches (thousands of pods.) But I haven't chanced it with my tea. I mean, If you're buying 100 at a time and using it for maintenance, why risk it with a moldy pod? 


I mean, the bad pods were obviously rank as hell: filthy blue, hairy mold, so I just threw them out. I can't quite imagine adding one of those molded pods into my brew. I mean, they're obviously nasty as hell according to sight and smell.


I have noticed that pod tea goes bad QUICK. I don't know if it's a result of living in an age of pasteurized juice/milk or what, but if I make that shit and try to save it even for 2 days, it gets moldy as hell real quick. And in a very disturbing way. You know how your old-ass pasta gets some white mold on it or whatever. This shit gets all kinds of colors of mold and quick. (Shit. Just read the above post about worms. Wouldn't be surprise, my best guess is that the good pod material is NOT radiated or sprayed or any of that shit.)


And even when I'm sick, I'm wary of the moldy pods. I can't imagine w/ds and whatever sickness I'd get from the moldy shit. W/ds are bad enough, thanks.

Yeah I have never had a moldy one like that. Just ones that had a bit gray discoloration, looked a bit fuzzier than it should have where it was gray, and the insides smelled mustier than normal pods do.


I've also never had a lot of pods, usually just get a few dozen at a time, so it kinds of sucks to throw away any.

Actually I have a jar full of seeds that I accumulated from dried pods.  The pods were dried but I only had them for a few days,  I only seperate them for alkaloid content in pods, where the seeds only have them on the outter side.  Also the seeds have a lot of unwanted oils I try to avoid during my pod extraction.  You see when I run low on pods I just scoop a cup or two of seeds outta my jar as a back up resource until my next pod batch arrives to get me through the day.  Even though I would have never noticed the worms, with the plain eye, normally.

So, the dealer probably does have a wholesale stock and some may be old, sure some are.  But in general, the heat should kill any bad chemicals in the pods or worms.  Shit worms are just extra protein!  Can you imagine if you got ahold of a couple ounces of worms?!?!  They live in pods fresh and are there during drying too.  Kinda like the tequilla worm in the bottom of the bottle, you'd be ripped off your ass more than likely! (The whole worm idea still isn't appealing to me, the Poltergeist worm thingy keeps coming to mind).

On bugs..D you eat shrimp? Lobster? Crab? It is all about percpetion.


For a Jew, shellfish is horrid but locusts are just fine. for Hindus, locusts and shellfish are just fine but beef is akin to cannabilism. For a Chinese, drinking milk or eating cheese is absolutely disgusting but they will skin a cat and fry it live (among other things)! Here in SE ASia I have labourers who eat bats, even road kill! Seriously. So, little white worms are no biggie.


Bet if you had not eaten for 4 days you would be begging for more of them!

Sounds right, never disagreed.  But preferably, no, worms aren't at the top of my list.  It's not like I'm going to go digging around in my back yard for a quick snack, umm maybe Gummy Worms![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Not like I am just going to put my Pods aside or anything.  Like I was saying, let's look to the possitive and hope they might be like "pre-harvest worms" adding some potency...and just maybe are stuffed with some good shit, or let's say the percentage that ODed and just fell asleep in there and absorbed a shit-load of opium.......dunno.....but I will assure they are down the hatch...mmm(vertually impossible to take out).

I'm inclined to believe them freaky worm lookin' things are merely germinated seeds (happens all the time if poppy seeds soak too long), even 5 minutes can make the difference between yellowish, translucent bitter ass tea, to milky opaque sweet tea with little white poppy sprouts a'floating.

Well I am going to bank on that, hope you are right.  Since they were in a seed only batch, they were slightly lighter than the seeds(so they floated) and look like possibly they could have been the perfect size for a seed sprout.  It would be more logical, and the sprouts could have occured in the pod before or right after harvest....good idea.

I have a question that I haven't seen posted on BL before.  Here goes:


I've recently switched vendors and notice that both of the batches I've gotten from the new person make me nauseous, which I never experienced before with the others.  The only difference is the size:  they're Jumbos instead of Larges, but I only use one at a time and always feel sick, whereas I used to use 4-6 of the larges and never got sick.  What could be the issue?  Both are sold as "Arizona Purples", so I don't understand.  Am I just using too much, or could the amount of alkaloids be different enough to make me feel like crap?  They're not moldy or anything, so I don't understand.  Help?

Hey just wanted to say that the exact same thing happened to me.  I used the same vendor with great success for a long time, but it was expensive.  Finally I decided to change vendors because the cost was getting too high.


Well, these new pods were much cheaper than the others, the first time I used them I used only 1 pod for withdrawals and didn't get sick.  The next time I used a couple to try and get high with I ended up throwing up a while later.


Somehow I kept telling myself it was a fluke and kept trying to use them but I got extremely ill and was forced to withdrawal at the same time.  I dunno what was wrong with the pods, but I have to guess there were pesticides or something on them.  Whatever the case, I've been terrified to try new vendors and have been wasting a lot of money because of it.

**Smokable end product from pods...NEED HELP!!!**


Got some questions i've been asking on the "true opium powder from poppy seeds" thread and haven't been able to get any legit answers...


I am trying to purify pod putty or tea to the extent of a potent blend of residual morphia and codia alkaloids left behind to form a smokable powder/tar substance...


1.What do you think about the use of Paraffin to de-fatten the stuff...It is supposed to engulf a bulk amount of the water insolubles such as plant sugars/fats..?(similar to petroleum ether but very inexpensive and available)


2.Is the addition of calcium hydroxide or calcium sulphate necessary or beneficial to the final product.


3.What is the solubility of morphia/codia alk's in hot water vs. cold water vs. isoprophyl alcohol??


4.I realize that ice cold water will draw out more codia alk' content when hot water ~80 degrees Celsius~ will draw out more of a morphia alk content..Is there a way to net both...ie. What if cold water is used first to get codia content out then the plant material is left and undergoes a hot water A/B extraction? 


I plan to get pods soon from a local flower shop...They are bulk and pretty affordable(25 med. sized for 7.25$)


I want to use hot water to draw out morphine content...Add paraffin..Filter using coffee filter to separate water soluble liquids from bulk plant material...Then freeze the liquid solution until 2/3 of it turns to ice...The ice portion should trap some plant fats/sugars..The solution left over  should be pretty pure and then evaporated on electric stove to get final product which should be a smokable tar/powder containing pretty decent ratio of psychotropic opiate/opioid alk's... 


Does anyone have any process they use to get a relatively pure smokable end product??I want to be able to have more of a controlled dose+shorten duration+possible ability to sell it+smoking is fun!(jk)...


Really want some educated responses as i haven't been able to find any(edit: any>many) in other forums?

Ok to start use Calcium Carbonate AkA Calcium 600 at urr local pharmacy, to withdrawl the morphine alka., then use a more evapoative liquid such as Bacardi 151 or higher, if resulting in the highest alcho. content alchohol and evaporate on the slowest/lowest temp as possible in the oven on the lowest temp poss.  BTW make sure u take all the oil filled seeds are extracted before slightly freezing (for 10 min or so) the mixture to take out the extracts before cooking.  Give it a try and get back 2 me.....

I am a little confused. When or why would i be cooking it...


I would not use Bacardi...I would rather get Isoprophyl Alcohol...its like >91% and cheap as shit...I would not want to slightly freeze...I want to make 2/3 of it frozen as the good stuff stays at the bottom and plant fats/sugars theoretically get stuck in the ice..


Still want more input...


Again i am trying to get the stuff as pure as i can..smokable form

not gonna let my question(s) die!


imma be a douche and repost this so someone with intellect will stumble across this and can inform me and steer me in the right direction 


Got some questions i've been asking on the "true opium powder from poppy seeds" thread and haven't been able to get any legit answers...


I am trying to purify pod putty or tea to the extent of a potent blend of residual morphia and codia alkaloids left behind to form a smokable powder/tar substance...


1.What do you think about the use of Paraffin to de-fatten the stuff...It is supposed to engulf a bulk amount of the water insolubles such as plant sugars/fats..?(similar to petroleum ether but very inexpensive and available)


2.Is the addition of calcium hydroxide or calcium sulphate necessary or beneficial to the final product.


3.What is the solubility of morphia/codia alk's in hot water vs. cold water vs. isoprophyl alcohol??


4.I realize that ice cold water will draw out more codia alk' content when hot water ~80 degrees Celsius~ will draw out more of a morphia alk content..Is there a way to net both...ie. What if cold water is used first to get codia content out then the plant material is left and undergoes a hot water A/B extraction?


I plan to get pods soon from a local flower shop...They are bulk and pretty affordable(25 med. sized for 7.25$)


I want to use hot water to draw out morphine content...Add paraffin..Filter using coffee filter to separate water soluble liquids from bulk plant material...Then freeze the liquid solution until 2/3 of it turns to ice...The ice portion should trap some plant fats/sugars..The solution left over should be pretty pure and then evaporated on electric stove to get final product which should be a smokable tar/powder containing pretty decent ratio of psychotropic opiate/opioid alk's...


Does anyone have any process they use to get a relatively pure smokable end product??I want to be able to have more of a controlled dose+shorten duration+possible ability to sell it+smoking is fun!(jk)...

Can anyone tell me how long tea will stay drinkable for? how many hours will it stay good in the fridge and not in the fridge? does it lose potency over time? thanks.

**Poppy pods! Which is More Potent; Eating straight up v.s Tea? Effects on the stomach?**


I have used many opioids and my favourites from a long list are morphine number one and codeine number two, but I've never had pods. I am wondering:


**1). Is it more potent if u grind the pods up and eat them straight up? or 

2). If you get the grinded pods and make a tea out of them?**


**Which out of these two methods would be more harmful on the stomach? **

Eating them straight would be the more efficient way as you would get all the opiates where as with tea you might not extract it all or you might destroy some in the process. Eating them is also probably worse on the stomach lol...so it's your call on what to do.

I combine the two methods...soak the ground pods in water for 20 minutes, stir, and drink sediment-y solution. It hits faster than choking down the powder and harder than a simple tea.

Ive been told not to use alcohol as it extracts and breaks down more of the alkaloids you don't want. All you want to be using is plain hot water and pure citric acid to adjust your PHs. The key is using enough water, if you don't use enough the water will reach its saturation point and you wont get all the alkos, ive read: 10 times the weight / volume (W/V) of water than that of the starting material but that is a very safe measure you could probably get way with 5X.


Also after your done extracting with the water for a couple of hours you wanna filter it while its as hot as possible(but not too hot, heat will destroy it) as Heat will expand all other particles in the liquid but the filter will not let them pass through, this filters almost everything except for the alkaloids and some other water soluble materials.


You can stop and evap there or you could further purify with the freezer and paraffin and even calcium.


There is an extremely detailed tek on another forum which i think is against the ruls for me to name. Try googleing "drugs forum" and it should come up, then go to the poppy sub forum and its in the stickies.

If you drink the tea you will feel effects come on much quicker, and I think that's a pretty important thing when you're talking about opiates.  You'll probably feel a lot higher that way.


Eating the pod material in theory sounds good because you would think that you get all of the opiates out, but it takes your body a long time to digest them so the morphine gets released into your body slower.


Trying to ingest pods is somewhat gross (awful flavor) no matter how you do it, but I personally find drinking the tea much more plausible than trying to choke down actual pod material.  I tried mixing it with yogurt once and it was pretty terrible tasting.  The effects that I got were less enjoyable than if I just made tea because the come up was so long.  So my recommendation:  Tea all the way baby!

Tea comes on quicker, slightly less potent I guess but eating the ground up pods takes longer to come on plus gives me unbearable nausea, worse then the tea would.

... it's not nearly as bitter when you eat it with yogurt, but it's extremely chunky and unnatural feeling... it's still definitely my preferred method of consuming it... start low though! it doesn't really feel like the tea... more nauseau and 'illness', at least in my case.


also grind up the pods really well, or else it'll be pretty unpleasant as the twigs work their way through you.


make sure to get a flavored yogurt. one spoonful of poppy pods and plain yogurt and you'll probably wanna give up on this whole "getting high" business. blech...


edit... it comes on a lot slower too! so don't overeat! give yourself a fat hour or two to 'judge'. but it'll prolly increase in intensity up to hour 3.5 ... at least for me.

IME mixing pods with yogurt doesn't taste any worse than tea.  I would mix 3 medium-large pod grounds (very finely ground) with 1-2 cups of yogurt.  What I used to do, was take a spoonful of powder/yogurt and chase it with iced coffee (or any sweet drink...but IMO iced coffee goes extremely well with poppy pods).  3 large pods was probably about 10-12 mouthfuls of material to choke down.


I say 'choke down' because at first, it's kinda hard to swallow the yogurt gunk without getting pod material stuck in your mouth/throat.  But after doing this for 2-3 days it's really easy to do AND less prep work/mess than making tea.  


I liked the high, it was a methadone type high.  it took at least an hour to kick in but when you wake up the next morning, you'll still be nicely buzzed.


The one thing that really sucks (if you're using pods daily) is if you think eating pods is difficult, just wait till you have to shit out pod material (combined with the poppy-pod-super-duper-constipation. ![:!](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/argh.gif)


But if you're down to your last couple pods, and you're still waiting for your next order try eating them.

poppy pods gave me hemmeroids. like, bleeding out of your anus, crapping out bloody, discontended bulbs of your own rectum-wall, and having to push it back into your asshole with your own fingers so you could go to work without excessive pain, burning, itching, or -leaking.-


anyways, besides that, I just want to add, you'll definitely need a chaser with your yogurt, like the above poster suggested.

99% sure. I felt an enlarged bulb sitting right in my rosebud. It felt enflamed, greasy, and itchy, and I really only felt relieved when I pushed that back in during a hot shower. It's possible it was entirely an external hemmeroid, but damn, it was so much better when I pushed it back inside. I would do this after my morning shit, and then usually once in the stall while at fucking work. You don't think you could get used to fingers in your asshole, but yeah, you can.


I never saw a doctor, so I can't say for sure. Anyways, it's mostly better now... I feel pain everytime I shit, still, however.


edit: the shit you admit to when you're drunk, eh? anyways, if you're constipdated, don't, for the love of god, sit there and force it up to an hour. get a laxative, or an enema, or whatever... PLEASE.

if it flares up again, I will. but as long as I keep well watered and an intelligent diet (no stoner-munchies for me anymore, dear god jesus, no), then it's pretty tolerable now. although it would be nice to get proof of my theory, heh. when it first happened, I was kinda broke, and the only way to get money for a doctor's visit would be to petition my parents for cash, hah.


anyways, this was my public service announcement. if you wanna play with opiates, please research hemmeroids first and weigh that in your decision ;p . i mean, the chance for addiction is obvious, but have you bled out your ass before?

that is some fcuked up sh1t


luckily for me i only ever do it once every other week (never crave it) and tbh I have done 10pods in tea before been itching like a motherclucker and puking every hour or so and tbh the high still wasnt amazing/special.


However im hoping its because ive only done it about 5-6 times and the effects will get better once my body recognises what the high is like.

LazyD, that sounds more like some EXTREME constipation.  Like a big piece of bowel movement that's too big to stretch out your anus and thus just pushes out your anus like a balloon.  There is medical term for it,.....sorry, can't recall right now though.

I think the term you're looking for is "prolapse."


In other news: adding calcium carbonate to poppy pod tea definitely seems to improve the final product.  And if you use flavored Tums, it even takes a little of the edge off that nasty bitter taste. Right now I'm all wrapped up in the warm fuzzy blanket of God's unconditional love and enjoying life.

I tossed in 4 Tums Extra (3g of calcium carbonate)  along with 20+g of pods when I was grinding them.  I then added some cranberry juice and water to them, warmed them in the microwave, let them soak for a while, then filtered out the grounds and drank that nasty brew like it was mother's milk.  


Let me also add that jazz (real jazz, not that smooth jazz shite which passes for jazz nowadays) sounds like the Voice of God when you're opiated.  Chet Baker and PPT for the win...

Best time to add the CC is during grinding your pods into powder, or sometimes I prefer to finely grind my pods in the blender and as I am waiting on the water to warm I add the finley crushed CC to the pod mix.  Somehow I believe miosturizing your pod mix before adding the CC allows the majority of the CC to do it's work of extracting the morph. alka., dunno but IMO I find better results.  While cooking I do prefer the CC600 supplement over adding straight antiacids b/c first u r getting a more pure, higher mg of the CC, with only needing a few tablets.  Than risking it with an antiacid that I may not get as much of a stronger strain as usual.  But time does help the extraction process, but not necessary.

Oh yeah, anyone have the resources and locate some Calcium Hydroxide...bump the CC in that case, anyone familiar with those findings IM me.

Oh BTW in my earlier posts you will find my prefer method of PPT/PST extractions, if any interests, all by process of gradual experimentation. Cold extractions work too, just find poss. insecticide/fertilizers a lesser concern when cooking, also helps CC and absorption when warming IMO.

Also because you don't need to "kill" out the morph. by destroying it with too high of temps((90 deg. and up deteriation susceptibility), I go through a pot or so of hot coffee and after tea consumption and before coffee I chew a few Tums to add more CC but even better to kill the taste, the fruity r the best!!

To follow up on myself: I notice that the morning after is considerably more pleasant with the calcinated tea.  I'm not feeling nearly so logy or hung over as I often do when drinking PPT, nor is my stomach nearly so queasy.  So I'm going to be taking my calcium regularly from now on.

Besides all the extra additives, I guess they may be better.  I just figured a more pure suppliment during extraction would be better.  Maybe you have something going for urself b/c in my experience I haven't realy found an OTC antiacid while reading the ingredients that had that amount of CC.  Are they prescribed?, hmm...got my interest up there.  Still in CC600 all u r getting is calcium c mixed with a good dose of Vit. D. , less additives.  But u may be on to something.  Lemme know, all we have is each other's adivice.....I'm up for it.

^^ You might be right on the additives. There's nothing special about these antacids, just the generic, extra strength calcium ones from CVS. [http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_product_detail.jsp?filterBy=&skuId=139846&productId=139846&navAction=jump&navCount=3](http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_product_detail.jsp?filterBy=&skuId=139846&productId=139846&navAction=jump&navCount=3). Looking at their site, I see they also have a "Maximum Strength" version with 1000mg CC per tablet [http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_product_detail.jsp?filterBy=&skuId=230995&productId=230995&navAction=jump&navCount=3](http://www.cvs.com/CVSApp/catalog/shop_product_detail.jsp?filterBy=&skuId=230995&productId=230995&navAction=jump&navCount=3)

What do you mean? I guess it depends on how it's packed. It will most likely sound like a bunch of hollow pods with tiny seeds in them when shaken =P. You might also get some or a ton of poppy seeds coming out of the box when shaken.


I assume you are asking because you are ordering them to your parent's house and don't want them asking questions? Not the best of ideas IMO.

There is some confusion as to the legality of pods in their dried and unprocessed form. I'd like to get some answers. Erowid says they're technically illegal, yet the law is rarely enforced. This does not really ease my mind.

I don't know that MS Contin is more harmful than pods... The addiction with pods is one of the worst possible. Add to that all this talk of cadmium and other heavy metals, not to mention the lack of regulation on quality and strength.

Well I think vendors sometimes get busted but I don't really hear about individual people getting busted very often (actually I never have).  I've been ordering poppy pods on the regular for half a year man and I never had the DEA knocking on my door.  I just really like to arrange flowers!!

So I've been reading this entire thread for a few days now(on a sidekick), and I'm 100% positive I'm eventually going to try pods...the one thing that has come to my attention is that sometimes people are waiting around for their package and maybe this has been asked since I'm only on page 22 of 40 but.....


Can you just go to a local craft store like say "michaels" or I dunno maybe some local flower or arts & craft shop and find pods there?... Is the reason you can find them cheaper online?


Also I'm from chicago can I just go down to chinatown..or some other ethnic neighborhood and find some dirty seeds...


Before you ask....I could order them online but just don't really want to order them to my house cause of the parents

So I'm making poppy putty from seeds. The water was pretty clear the first hour or so of soaking the seeds, then it became very opaque. I let it dry overnight, and there's still a good bit of liquid...but well...it looks like semen. Is this normal?

You can mess with seeds if you want, but there are MANY reasons it is better to go with pods.


As for craft stores, you can certainly try to find them if you want. Two problems though... you have to make sure they haven't been treated with pesticides or preservatives, and you have to make sure they are the right kind. Not all poppy pods are created equal, and the manager at Micheal's might look at you funny if you ask, "Now are these papaver somniferum?"

Beats me, I can't begin to guess how you could fit pod tea in the bum.

just an update on the method of taking pods described above. it does work and quite well. i mixed 3 large spoonfuls of powdered pods with around 500ml grapefruit juice and chugged away. i had to drink about 3 full drinks as my dose for pods is currently about 45-50 grams. this time it was likely less prob around 30-35 grams (i did not weigh as it was the last of my gigantic box of 500 pods) and i got just as high if not higher than normal and nothing was different except that i consumed the entire pod instead of just the water from a usual steeping. i always take grapefruit juice and other boosters like dyphenhydramine and chew some tums before consuming the tea   so the potentiation was not the factor that made me higher. it looks like i found my new favorite route of ingestion for pods. anyone who does the whole steeping in water thing should definately give this a try because it does work wonders IME.

They will grow pretty much anywhere, except not so well, IIRC, in winter weather. The ony thing you have to be careful of is that they grow like crazy and will spread. Keep them maintained and don't let them start creeping in your neighbors yard.

would americans REALLY notice someone growing opium poppies, and report them?


I mean, in the UK they are legal, so it is a non-issue,

but most people wouldn't have a clue that those flowers were opium poppies.

that includes 90% of the people growing them.


In the summer, people have busted me harvesting poppies from their front gardens.

a lot of them didnt believe me that they were growing opium =P

but they were =]

I've never had any problem ordering pods from suppliers on a certain online auctionhouse. There is nothing illegal about buying floral decorations. If you really want to be on the poppy pod d/l I suppose you can buy a refillable credit card and use that. But honestly, it's not like the cops are going to kick down your doors to send you to prison for a couple dozen dried flowers.

Sorry about that. 


Let's just say, without being more specific, that it's easy to get pods and, to the best of my knowledge, nobody has been arrested for buying a couple dozen or even a couple hundred. This isn't even buying valiums from an overseas pharmacy: this is purchasing floral decorations. So long as you don't advertise the fact you're purchasing it for poppy straw, things appear to be copacetic with the DEA. So I wouldn't lose a lot of sleep over someone tracking your pod purchases.


(If you start liking them too much, you may wind up losing sleep over your habit... but that's another story altogether).

There is a guide on making a form of pod putty you can smoke somewhere in this thread. Personally I think the amount of work that goes into create it is a bit more than I'd want to do, but others would disagree.

more effort than emptying the pods you have of seeds,

and getting high from the pods, while you wait for the seeds to grow,

anticipating your soon-to-be self-sustainable supply of both pods and raw opium (to which nothing compares).
