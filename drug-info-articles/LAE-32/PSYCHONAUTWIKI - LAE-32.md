## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: 500 - 1500 µg

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 10 hours

**Lysergic acid ethylamide** (also known as **LAE-32** , **LAE** , and **d-ethyllysergamide** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. It is one of the least known and least researched psychedelic substances.

The pharmacology of LAE-32 is complex [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] , but it acts primarily by binding to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain, much like LSD and other serotonergic psychedelics. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## History and culture

### The CIA and Project MKULTRA Findings

LAE-32 was experimented with by the CIA as part of Project MKULTRA. It was reported to create a condition similar to that of schizophrenia in mentally healthy individuals, characterized by indifference and depersonalization. While it was reported that, when used on schizophrenics, it created a condition that allowed the patients to become indifferent to their hallucinations and cease hallucinatory excitation.

## Chemistry

LAE-32, or d-lysergic acid ethylamide, is a semisynthetic substance of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) family.

Its chemical structure consists of a bicyclic hexahydroindole ring fused to a bicyclic quinoline group (lysergic acid). At carbon 8 of the quinoline an N, generally N-ethyl carboxamide is bound, LAE-32 is additionally substituted at carbon 6 with a methyl group.

## Pharmacology

LAE-32 most likely acts by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain. It may, like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , bind to dopamine receptors as well.

## Subjective effects

The subjective effects of LAE-32 are reportedly mainly sedating and depersonalizing, creating a state of indifference in users.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - This effect is mild compared to traditional [sedatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedatives) such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) and [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - LAE-32 is unique among psychedelics for its ability to suppress willpower.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Cannabis** - Cannabis has an unexpectedly strong and somewhat unpredictable synergy with psychedelics. Extreme caution is advised when using this combination as it can significantly increase the chances of a negative psychological reaction like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their usual cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid over intake.
- **Amphetamines** & **Cocaine** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol is well known to lower seizure threshold and psychedelics also cause occasional seizures.

## Legal status

LAE-32 is not explicitly illegal in any nation, but it is possibly illegal to possess in the United States for purposes of consumption due to the Federal Analog Act.
