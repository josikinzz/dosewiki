## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpiperidines. These are compounds containing a phenylpiperidine skeleton, which consists of a piperidine bound to a phenyl group.

### Background

Glutethimide is a hypnotic and sedative. Its use has been largely superseded by other drugs.

### Indication

For the treatment of insomnia.

### Pharmacodynamics

Glutethimide, like the barbiturates, is a hypnotic sedative. It was introduced in 1954 as a safer alternative to barbiturates but was soon determined to be just as likely to cause addiction and withdrawal symptoms.

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Agonist
GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator

### Absorption

Variable

### Metabolism

Hepatic. Glutethimide is almost completely metabolized.

### Half-life

10-12 hours

### Toxicity

In adults, death has been reported after 5 g. The usual lethal dose is 10 to 20g, although survival after a dose of 28 g has been reported.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Glutethimide is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Acenocoumarol
The therapeutic efficacy of Acenocoumarol can be decreased when used in combination with Glutethimide.
Acetazolamide
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetazolamide is combined with Glutethimide.
Acetophenazine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetophenazine is combined with Glutethimide.
Agomelatine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Glutethimide is combined with Agomelatine.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Take with or without food. The absorption is unaffected by food.

### Mechanism of action

Glutethimide seems to be a GABA agonist which helps induce sedation. It also induces CYP 2D6. When taken with codeine, it enables the body to convert higher amounts of codeine (higher than the average 5 - 10%) to morphine. This combination of effects enhances sedation.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase that catalyzes the side-chain hydroxylation and cleavage of cholesterol to pregnenolone, the precursor of most steroid hormones (PubMed:21636783). Catalyzes three sequential oxidation reactions of cholesterol, namely the hydroxylation at C22 followed with the hydroxylation at C20 to yield 20R,22R-hydroxycholesterol that is further cleaved between C20 and C22 to yield the C21-steroid pregnenolone and 4-methylpentanal (PubMed:21636783). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule. Two electrons are provided by NADPH via a two-protein mitochondrial transfer system comprising flavoprotein FDXR (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin reductase) and nonheme iron-sulfur protein FDX1 or FDX2 (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin) (PubMed:21636783)

  "wikipedia": `# Glutethimide
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutethimide*

Glutethimide (brand names included Doriden, Elrodorm, and Noxyron) is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant drug of the piperidine chemical class, one of many non-barbiturate, "barbiturate-like" GABAergic medications exhibiting general calming, relaxing, or "tranquilizing" properties in addition to relieving anxiety and promoting sleep. As such, "nerve pills" or "sleeping pills" were common vernacular descriptions of these types of medications.

## History

Glutethimide was developed Ciba Specialty Chemicals in 1954, and approved for medical use in the United States by the U.S. FDA in 1957. It was indicated for treating insomnia, and branded Doriden by Ciba. Generic trade names that followed included Elrodorm and Noxyron. Following the passage of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 in the U.S., followed by the creation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in 1973, the "war on drugs" began to prioritize the criminalization of combination drugs containing controlled substances.
The DEA declared glutethimide to be as habit-forming and addicting as barbiturates and other highly-regulated CNS depressants such as Quaalude and  Placidyl. Abrupt cessation of this substance can result in rebound effects similar to those in withdrawal from any GABAergic substance, including alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines.

## Chemical composition and synthesis

The (R) isomer has a faster onset of action and more potent anticonvulsant activity in animal models than the (S) isomer.

The base catalyzed conjugate addition of 2-phenylbutyronitrile [769-68-6] (1) to ethyl acrylate (2) gives ethyl 4-cyano-4-phenylhexanoate, CID:139890735 (3). Alkaline hydrolysis of the nitrile group into an amide group, and subsequent acidic cyclization of the product affords the desired glutethimide (4).

## Mechanism of action and uses

Glutethimide is a CYP2D6 enzyme inducer, enabling the body to convert higher amounts of codeine to morphine, frequently leading to ingestion of glutethimide alongside codeine-containing products, such as Tylenol No. 3 or No. 4, and widespread misuse, overdose, and fatalities. Colloquially called "hits," "pancakes and syrup," or "Dors and 4s", this combination is highly potent and often lethal due to extreme respiratory depression.
In recreational quantities, any form of glutethimide was colloquially called a "Ciba" and all trade names of the medicine were manufactured as a white pill/tablet with a score line directed to be taken by mouth, and containing 500mg of the active ingredient.
During the 1980s, glutethimide became increasingly harder to access and subject to many restrictions as a CSA-classified Schedule II substance, but market demand for the product continued to exist among northeastern U.S. states and metropolitan centers, leading to the substance's clandestine "underground" manufacturing and sale, which only increased when methaqualone was fully withdrawn from the U.S. market and classified a Schedule I drug.

### Clinical research

Glutethimide's effect on quickening the conversion of codeine to morphine was studied clinically, including some research in the 1970s in various countries. In these studies, it was used under carefully monitored circumstances as a form of oral opioid agonist substitution therapy, particularly as a Substitutionmittel that may be a useful alternative to methadone.
Glutethimide was available in the United States until 1993, when production ceased and it was withdrawn from the market. Since 2013, the U.S. DEA has limited annual production to three grams, equivalent to six Doriden tablets, suggesting that current use is limited to small-scale research.

## Legal status

### United States

Glutethimide is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It was originally a Schedule III drug in the United States under the Controlled Substances Act, but in 1991 it was upgraded to Schedule II, several years after it was discovered that misuse combined with codeine increased the effect of the codeine and deaths had resulted from the combination. It has a DEA ACSCN of 2550 and a 2013 production quota of 3 g.
