## Subjective Experience

Mulungu has a long history of use as a remedy for stress, anxiety and insomnia in its
native Brazil. It is a natural sedative, but it has also been used to treat a wide variety
of other ailments.

It is certainly psychoactive, and this was an experiment I was looking forward to.

However, in the ethnobotanical world, the depth and strength of an experience is
often determined by the quality of the source and the competence of the preparation.
These are fundamental matters, and will often set the course of the experience, or
non-experience. Many vendors do not stock fresh, and over a prolonged period
botanicals can lose their potency and efficacy. Regarding preparation, this can be
complicated, with some decoctions producing better results than others. Some
methods simply don't work.

With mulungu I engaged in what was, for me, a complex decocting effort. I simmered
9g of root bark for 45 minutes, strained it, and then consumed the liquid as tea. It
wasn’t a bad taste.

It worked to a degree, as I felt moderately relaxed and light headed. I then had my
usual afternoon nap, and slept in peace.

A distinct psychoactivity was in play, even though it was far from overwhelming. I
also experienced dreams during the subsequent night which were slightly more
persistent and vivid than usual.

Despite this minor success, I had a feeling that I could do better. Some months later I
therefore experimented again, using an entirely different decoction.

On this occasion I used 5g to produce a tea via a more conventional method, but
using piping hot rather than boiling water. I gently stirred the mulungu in the teapot
and sipped the mild tasting fluid over a 15 minute period.

I consumed at 7:30pm, and sure enough, over then next few hours I experienced a
heady sedation, which peaked somewhere around the two hour mark. To a lesser
degree it was still in play when I retired to bed at 11pm.

During my sleep cycles the mulungu really did manifest itself. Dreams were
abundant, and were again lucid and vivid, with the memory of the final lengthy
episode still being clear well after I awoke.

This rather took me by surprise, so much so that I spent part of the following
morning researching this aspect via the Internet. It does appear that this is indeed a
serious dream herb, with similar reports appearing across a number of specialist
forums.

My surprise was magnified given that I had procured this from a source which didn’t
always offer the freshest of materials.

This is an extremely interesting botanical. It invoked a range of sedating effects, and
my overview of its oneirogenic properties is by no means exaggerated.

It is certainly one which I intend to return to in the future.

== In traditional Bantu cultures ==

## Origin, diffusion, and etymology

The original early-Bantu name for the highest God of gods, creator and father of all gods, was probably Nyàmbé, possibly from the verb root -àmb-, "to begin".  With the diversification of Bantu cultures, other names came about, with "Mulungu" emerging in the ancient Southern-Kaskazi group (about 6000 BC).  The etymology of the name is disputed.  One hypothesis is that the name is derived from a verb root -ng-, meaning "to be rectified", "to become right"; in this case, the original concept of Mulungu is that of a creator god that established the original, right order on the world.

### Description

All traditional Bantu cultures have a notion of a "creator god", a concept which was already established in the Niger–Congo cultures.  This creator god is usually seen as a remote deity, far and detached from men and living beings; in some cases, it is more of an impersonal "creating force" or a primum movens than a "God" in the usual sense of the word.  Even when described as a personal god, the Creator is believed to be far and detached from men and living beings; this detachment is the subject of a number of Bantu myths describing how the creator left the Earth, moving to the sky, as a consequence of him being upset with men or annoyed by their activities.  It is thus a common trait of Bantu religions that no prayers, and usually no worship, is actually directed to the creator; men interact with lower-levels gods and spirits that are closer and more interested in human affairs.  These general lines are common to traditional concepts of Mulungu as found in Kikuyu, Ruvu, and other cultures.  A Nyamwezi myth about the departure of Mulungu from the Earth involves Mulungu being upset of the fires set by men to the landscape, and asking the spider to weave a web for him to climb up to the sky.

## Modern uses

With the advent of either Islam or Christianity, the word "Mulungu" was usually adopted to mean the Christian or Islamic God.  Over thirty translations of the Bible in African languages use the word Mulungu to refer to the Father.  As another example, Jesus Christ is referred to as mwana wa Mulungu ("child of Mulungu") in modern religious songs in Chichewa language (Malawi).  The word was also used in Swahili Islamic literature before the derivative name "Mungu" became more common.
Southern Africa
In Mozambique nowadays Mulungo in CiSena language is seen as the Almighty God directly related to Christianity as Father of Jesus Christ. Mulungu wanga which means My God.
