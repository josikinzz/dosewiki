**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 4-HO-EPT Thread!**


![2iusv2p.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi68.tinypic.com%2F2iusv2p.jpg&hash=af1d5b8b894cd374eb790e0d64616841)


*4-hydroxy-N-ethyl-N-propyltryptamine*​

There is  almost no information available about the chemical as of this post so  there's not much else to put here, but it has recently become widely  available and thus deserves its own thread. This is an entirely novel  psychedelic so I must urge caution to all those out there who intend to  or are considering trying it for themselves. Though so far the class of  chemicals it comes from appears to produce fewer risky physical effects  than many others on average, there is no way to tell how anyone will  react to an entirely new molecule until they actually do it and find  out. Please, if you do plan to take this chemical, know your sensitivity  to these kinds of psychedelics first and start with reasonable doses  before working your way up.


That said, in the case that you do take  4-HO-EPT, please consider adding any important information about your  experience to this thread as well, so that others will be more educated  about its effects and safety. Due to the popularity of many closely  related chemicals to this one and the recent outgrowth of tryptamines it  seems likely that many people will be trying this one for themselves if  they get the chance, so the more information we have about it really  will greatly benefit everyone, especially since we're starting from  basically nothing.


------------------------------


So far, I  have taken 4-HO-EPT once myself at 25 mg. I wrote a trip report about  it which can be found here:  [(4-HO-EPT/25 mg) - First Time - A Short, Sweet, Powerful, and Novel Experience](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/804944-%284-HO-EPT-25-mg%29-First-Time-A-Short-Sweet-Powerful-and-Novel-Experience).


To  sum it up, I found that for me personally 25 mg was a good starter  dose, not too strong but not too light either. The physical side effects  were very mild, consisting mostly of a slightly increased heart rate  and stomach upset at the onset that both passed before the peak,  clumsiness during the peak, sweating, and light leg tremors and jaw  chattering, along with a cannabis-induced headache. The primary  subjective effects were a mix of stimulation and sedation both somewhat  mild, notable but not forced euphoria, enhanced sensory pleasure, very  light threshold open eye visuals, and a brief phase of intense but  transparent closed eye hallucinations, followed by a shift into a field  of white light with some imaginative imagery in it. The first alerts  came within ten or fifteen minutes, the peak effects began about an hour  after dosing, mostly passed within an hour after that, and the entire  trip was down by about four to four and a half hours after dosing. I also have noticed since writing the report that there was a good afterglow lasting for at least a couple days following the trip, during which I felt very relaxed and happy.


It  was a very unique experience, and one that I personally found quite  enjoyable. I will not recommend these doses to anyone else because  others must find what is safe for themselves first, but now that I know  that 25 mg is a good starting point for me I am considering taking 35 mg  next time, probably within about a month once I work my way back to it.


If anyone else has anything at all to share about this one, please do!

How does this compare to 4-HO-DPT?

I would say that 4-HO-EPT was very much alike 4-HO-DPT for me in some key ways, but also less unique from the others overall.


The headspaces, at least at the doses I've taken, seem almost exactly the same. They're both extremely lucid, even when the trip feels deep at the same time. There is basically no disorientation nor any significant stimulation. Though, I would say that when the hallucinations start playing a role 4-HO-DPT makes me feel somewhat drifty, whereas 4-HO-EPT had more of an excitement.


Physically, 4-HO-EPT was between 4-HO-DPT and the other 4-substituted tryptamines for me. For instance, 4-HO-DPT has not given me any leg tremors at any dose, and 4-HO-EPT gave me almost none, but still a couple, at a dose where the others would have given me more. I also found 4-HO-EPT more physically euphoric than 4-HO-DPT, it had me stretching and smiling the whole time and felt more like a classic psychedelic in that way.


Visually, I would say that they produce similar imagery with eyes closed, though 4-HO-EPT was far more colorful and geometric, in a way that was overall similar to mushrooms and DMT, much more traditional feeling than 4-HO-DPT. With eyes open, they both felt similar for me in how they can be only very weak even when the closed eye is so strong, but notably at this point 4-HO-DPT is already a bit visionary, like hands forming in the walls, but also dark, limited to a fewer shadowy colors, whereas 4-HO-EPT was mostly abstract and formless, but also had a greater range and prominence of colors, more like what you'd expect from a low dose of something like mushrooms.


As for the other details, 4-HO-EPT is active at doses comparable to the typical tryptamines, unlike how 4-HO-DPT requires very large doses when taken orally. It also only lasted a few hours, whereas 4-HO-DPT lasts me six or seven when dosed orally, but it also kicked in much faster. I cannot compare to the more popular method of insufflation for 4-HO-DPT though, that might get rid of some of these differences.


However, I have not had an overly strong trip on either yet, so I really can't fairly compare them at that level.

No problem, I'm glad to contribute. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's an interesting one for sure. I think it would probably be likely to be enjoyed by those who also enjoy both 4-HO-DPT and the classic indoles.


I've actually bumped up my month plan too.... I think I'm going to take this again on Monday. I've been really curious to see what it can really do since the first time felt more like a taste, so I think I'm probably going to take around 35-40 mg this time.

So a couple days ago I myself had the privilege to sample this new chem. Although it was a bit underwhelming (due to a lower dosage) I can see a lot of potential in the future! In the beginning of my day I took a 1mg allergy test without any noticeable problems or effects, which meant a green light for my first experimentation later that night. 


So roughly 10 hours later I prepared 15mg of the 4-HO-EPT (fumarate) into a gell capsule and swallowed it with water. 15 mins later a had a small snack just for the hell of it, which thinking back on it now probably delayed the effects for a little bit longer. After about an hour and a half later I started to feel the first effects. Although subtle, I started to feel both a body and mental buzz similar to the buzz I get off other tryptamines. It had a smooth feeling to it without any negative body load and made me feel more awake and put me in a good mood. As for the visuals they were also subtle, I would have to stare at something for a few seconds to notice slight morphing in my peripheral vision. Overall the effects were noticeable for a couple hours but I didn't keep track of the time too closely.


Overall I feel like it is something that has lots of potential at the right dosage and ROA. 15mg was a good way to dip my toes into the water without doing in too deep too fast, but next time I will most likely up the dosage to 30-40mg (orally) in a week or twos time. Or maybe I will try a different ROA, I will decide that when the time comes. And if you are planning on experimenting this on your own I highly recommend you treat it with the upmost respect as there is very little known about it and could have any kind of effect. Anyways I want to thank you for reading this, have fun and stay safe!

Hey Coolfriday, thanks again for bringing your experience here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm glad that you enjoyed your trip on it as well! I could definitely imagine its signature still being present at 15 mg, that seems like it would be a pretty nice dose to get euphoria and not too much of everything else. I'm very much looking forward to what you'll have to say in your further experiments as well, especially after today!


I'm on 40 mg orally of 4-HO-EPT at the moment, and it's pretty great. It's put a lot of perspective on the lower doses.... This is a very interesting psychedelic, and also a very complex one. I'll be a writing a trip report about it later, obviously just because there's almost no information available on it right now, but also because I really want to try to capture the feeling this trip has given me, going through like several stages of effect.... I truly think that this molecule has the potential to be one of the greats, at least in my book. I don't want to rave about it too much because I don't want to push my opinion too strongly right now while there are very few others to oppose it, but I really do see something special in this one.... I intend to explore it as much as possible while it's still around.


For now though, I'm going to go back to enjoying the trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Alright, my report for my experience with 40 mg is up. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It can be found here:

I'm honestly a little too tired and headachy right now to give a summary on it, but it's a little bit of an easier read than my first report so I'd encourage anyone to read it if they're interested!

Having a few smaller doses between 1mg and 15mg is probably a better way...

I had pleasant, albeit mild, introduction to 4-HO-EPT at 22 milligrams (4 insufflated followed by 18 orally). I think I'll need a bigger dose to get an idea of the true character of the substance, but for the sake of documenting a chemical with very little existing data, I wrote a brief report:

I took this substance yesterday for the third time, at 65 mg orally. This was definitely the most interesting experience I've had on 4-HO-EPT so far.... It felt like it really went deeper than the others to the point that it finally felt like a "full" trip, in that it was both very engaging and that I was able to take quite a lot away from it. Still a surprising lack of hallucinogenic effects compared to things like the headspace and euphoria though, but what is present is still incredibly interesting to me. If anyone is intrigued in more of what this chemical can do I would suggest taking a look at my trip report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It can be found here:

Hey Kaleida, do you think doses upward of 65- maybe 100 would be physically comfortable with this substance?

I really couldn't say with any certainty about the higher doses, but I can say that 65 mg for me was still very comfortable. There was a body load that resembled most other tryptamines in having things like sweating, mucus build up, or mild tremors, but nothing seriously disconcerting, and what I do get from it I actually find to be lighter than most other tryptamines with similar strength trips. I would still be cautious with it since so few people have ever taken it and for all I know individual responses could vary quite a lot, but I personally wouldn't feel any real fear of potential physical consequences with doses up to 100 mg based on my experiences so far. It may be quite physically intense in its own way by that point though, but probably in a more pleasurable way if this last trip was anything to go on.

Two days ago I've taken the 4-HO-EPT for the first time. After performing the allergy test - it has a weird taste, but not unpleasant to me at all, Ive decided to take 40mg further complimented by 15mg 4-Aco-MET. A little over than 24 hours before that I've taken 100mcg (1 blotter) of ETH-LAD that produced mind-blowing trip when I decided to smoke a huge bowl with concentrates during the peak (TR coming...). I know the tolerance had played a huge role but with me lysergamides do not have as much cross-tolerance to tryprtamines and I only have two days off a week and I was excited to try something new...![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Subject: 170Lbs male with about 10 years of extensive psychoactives research which includes: DMT, Mushrooms, 4-Aco-DMT, 4-Aco-MET, 4-Aco-DET, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DPT, LSD, AL-LAD, ETH-LAD, ALD-52, Mescaline, Allylescaline, Methallylescaline, 2C-P, bk-2C-B, MDMA, Amanitas, Salvia, Amphetamines and other stims. Previous trip was on 100mcg ETH-LAD a day ago. Almost empty stomach (light vegetarian breakfast taken) prior the experience.


Set & setting: Solo trip, at home, late at night, feeling comfortable, excited about experience.


Dose: 40mg (measured on a decent milligram scales with +/- 1mg) of 4-HO-EPT, encapsulated in two gel caps - 30mg with the 10mg chaser. 15mg of 4-Aco-MET was also consumed at an hour and 45 minutes into the experience.


Experience:


T=00:00 - Took the first capsule with some green tea and going to take a shower.


T+00:30 - First alerts - noticed changes in the thought process, very light. Smoked some cannabis.


T+00:45 - Took the second capsule before the psychedelic train had departed and smoked some more cannabis ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


T+01:00 - Definitely psychedelic head space emerging, body starting to feel light as air, my hands are weightless. Mind gets clearer minute by minute and Im loving the feeling. No visual or auditorial activity noticed. Pronounced intellectual stimulation - browsing books, psychology, art, spirituality, natural healing, human archetypes, Bradbury, Huxley, e. t. c. I spent some time with the runes as well - I highly recommend "The Book of Runes" by Ralph Bloom for those interested in esoteric discoveries. 

Insight is extremely easy at this point, I feel that my mind is ever-expanding... Far from ego death and not even feeling the softening of it, nor the withdrawing, like with 4-Aco-MET, rather the ego feels blissfully integrated with the body and the world around.


T+01:40 - I'm seriously enjoying the headspace. Like Kaleida put it out: It is deeply satisfying in a cosmic orgasmic kind of way...

The thought about the tolerance from the previous day and losing that wonderful feeling makes me measure and eat 15mg of 4-Aco-MET - I really want THIS to last as long as it can. It was rather a quick decision based on my immediate thought and it turned out to be a great idea! 

Some sweating is noticed, very similar to my "lucy sweats" - very enjoyable to me. More cannabis is smoked as well.


T+02:30 - No visuals or other perceptual changes that are noteworthy. But I'm glowing, feeling invincible, fearless, and not with over-inflated stimmed up ego, but rather with God-like Understanding. Thinking of my past mistakes is easy and productive, this substance makes me want to trust my instincts. Feels like the extrasensory ability is amplified, I feel very calm and ready for anything. Feeling of Great Transcendence is all-enveloping. I'm thinking: "Why can't we bring that amazing clear feeling into our everyday life? Why do we always forget it, why forget the most important lessons and fall into own ego traps again and again?..." It makes me understand why certain people deciding to become monks/nuns for the rest of their life - it is a way for trying to maintain that blissfull egoless feeling of acceptance. 

I feel wonderful, not euphoric but rather naturally awed and quieted down by the importance of accepting what is NOW.


T+03:00 - Coming down already, in a similar way as with LSD - still feeling very transcendent and light as air! Body feels weightless. Contemplating the nature around me, watching cars go by with people in them going by their business thinking their busy thoughts, even the grey snowy sky looks appealing and full of bliss!

Smoking cannabis with 4-HO-EPT reminds me of smoking it while tripping on LSD - it feels that the cannabis high cannot penetrate the true high given by the psychedelic and just providing some smoothing out effects. Full of insights, glowing with understanding, lots of art ideas and thoughts of social participation (I'm usually quite a hermit). I feel genuinely happy!


T+04:00 - Very intellectual and pleasant afterglow, feeling serene. Still no thoughts of eating. Deep appreciation of finer concepts of life. Taking shower...


T+05:00 - Food tasted normal, reduced appetite and no real desire for sex. After eating took 150mg of 5-HTP and 100mg of L-Theanine. Sleep was achieved within an hour.


Next day - Woke up refreshed even though slept for only 4 hours. 

Took a daily stack of nootropics upon waking up and it was triggering flashbacks of trip's insights throughout the day, very nice! At work I was so wise and productive that a co-worker of mine bought me a six pack of beer after my revealing speech about relationships! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Conclusion:

  What an amazing substance! Pure intellectual bliss with very very strong analysis enhancement and patterns recognition. My mind felt stunningly clear and very aware. 

  4-HO-EPT made me feel very similar to when I was able to achieve satori (deep blissful realization of WHAT IS, that is very short in duration) during deep meditation session or the feeling of AWE when you are swept by the beauty of nature at certain moments of life. I really want to call it "Angel Dust", because that's how it felt to me - incredibly light, airy and very transcending. This substance has pronounced "Air" spirit so it would be good for "Airy" individuals and especially good when taken high in the mountains where there's a lot of winds imo...

  Not sure if my experience could be considered +++ by Shulgin's scale because it makes you forget that you took the drug and focus deeply on Understanding.

  It definitely shares similarities with LSD, in fact that was the only tryptamine that was reminiscent of it's effects (I haven't tried 4-HO-MPT yet).

  I am stocking up on this substance as I see a huge potential for self-work, meditational practices and micro-dosing. The gift of 4-HO-EPT is in it's intellectual properties entirely, don't expect hedonistic feelings and pretty visuals. It may be used as a "deepening" agent in combinations with other trypts I'm thinking - felt a very nice synergy with 4-Aco-MET. Could be used as a party social drug but in a warm organic hippie atmosphere rather than stimmed up laser clubbing. I ranked it high along with my other favorites.

  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clear clean mental trip that doesn't last too long and does not load your body and psyche, reading and writing was remarkable with it. Also I have not noticed any body load besides quite pleasurable sweats 8)

My next dose with it will be 65-70mg.


Thanks for reading! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You really do, Xorkoth. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I think there's a very good chance you would find it enjoyable anyway, just based on my experiences with it! And I would certainly be very interested in hearing your thoughts about it as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Awesome report Volsam, thanks for sharing. :D I'm glad to hear that you got so much out of it! I can imagine how that addition of 4-AcO-MET could make for a really nice combination too, I could see 4-HO-EPT synergizing with a lot of trips in that way really.


Your experience really does seem to resonate with the few I've had so far in a lot of ways.... I also do find particularly that 4-HO-EPT feels a lot more like it brings me to the same sort of pure states I get from deep meditation than most psychedelics. When I first started practicing meditative techniques and found them to be a bit more flashy and emotional before they became just another part of repertoire of conscious states I was also very new to cannabis and able to produce some fairly vivid visionary effects and psychological states by relaxing to such a degree in environments such as a darkened room while lying in bed, and these things combined got me to some of the most freeing, mystical, or complex inner experiences that I have had honestly before or since. These days my meditative experiences tend to be much more solely psychologically and emotionally oriented and I am perfectly content with that, but it is always nice to be able to have the right keys to unlock those deeper spaces within myself for the times when it feels appropriate to do so, and 4-HO-EPT really seems to achieve that in me as it brings me to a very similar state as I recall from those times in wholly every way possible, be it in the body, the mind, or the inner visions. And the fact that it can do this in particular without really having any of the distractions that many or most other psychedelics often provide at the same time, even being practically transparent on the body and the sensorium at fully active doses, makes this I think a substance truly worth holding on to.


I do feel the need to say as well, though I entirely agree that this drug's focus is very strongly directed towards the mind, don't be surprised if you find it to provide you with some hedonistic rewards or beautiful hallucinogenic effects from time to time as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) My experience with 65 mg certainly showed me that these things can be brought out of it if you just dig deep enough, though even then I still felt I was only seeing the tip of the iceberg. Based on my experiences with 4-HO-EPT and other tryptamines so far though, I'm starting to form a theory about its potency for producing these individual effects.... It seems to me like it might be possible that whatever causes 4-HO-DPT to have a drastic loss in oral potency compared to 4-HO-MPT and other 4-substituted tryptamines has only halfway happened with 4-HO-EPT, which would seem logical enough given that it lies structurally in between them, but I'm suspecting that the different types of effects these molecules produce may be disproportionately affected, such that in 4-HO-EPT's case I'm feeling like its hallucinogenic effects may be closer to, but just a bit more potent than 4-HO-DPT's, whereas its psychological and emotional effects may be closer to, but just a bit less potent than 4-HO-MPT's. I'm intending on continuing the same kind of dosage increase for my next experience on it as I have used already, meaning that my first was 25 mg, x1.6 for my second time was 40 mg, x1.6 for my third time was 64, and so I added 1 mg to smooth it out. Multiplying it again would be 104, but I think I'm going to go with a solid 100 mg so that I really can directly compare it to 4-HO-DPT, since I've also taken that exact dose of that orally. I think that should definitely clear some things up. :D


Anyway, thanks very much again for sharing, and for going into so much detail and giving some of your thoughts on the whole thing. It was very interesting and insightful, and I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about your next experience on it as well! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It would be so awesome to trip with someone just as interested in such states of mind as me!.. imagine if we can do it together, just guys from bl who are into that - when in such group I tend to go exploring deeper and the trip overall will be multiplied by minds that are alike! Fun, fun, fun...%)


4-HO-DPT compared to 4-HO-EPT felt "dirtier" to me and with lesser developed head trip and rather pronounced body load, including some chest discomfort that was in a way similar to my bigger doses of 4-HO-MiPT. Individual chemistry and metabolism play a key role, I'm guessing, when it comes to such substances.

Also the feeling of being fearless that 4-HO-EPT gave me, could potentially be used as a launchpad for smoked DMT imo. My poor ego gets shattered every time I smoke a decent dose so I naturally have apprehension although the benefits always overpower it ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I'll test it out and post it here!


Posting TRs makes me feel involved and I'm hoping more people will seek out information before trying new drugs so there will be less trip disasters!

Definitely agreed on the sentiments about there being new tryptamines to try and writing reports on them, I don't think I could have asked for a more exciting turn of events at this particular point on my psychedelic journey. Don't you just love it when things line up like that? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Tripping with other BLers is pretty neat, I've had a couple lucky opportunities to experience this already. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I sure wouldn't mind taking 4-HO-EPT in a group if the chance ever presented itself.... Something to keep in mind for making vacation plans. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Your assessment of 4-HO-DPT vs 4-HO-EPT sounds pretty right for me so far too, though I still want to push further on 4-HO-DPT for hallucinogenic reasons. On the body though, it certainly wasn't the dirtiest thing ever, far from it, but it was getting kind of tight already considering that I still wasn't tripping that hard yet, which I could see translating to the chest discomfort you mentioned. I also felt this very heavy feeling when I took 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT, almost like it took a full conscious effort just to breath (though it wasn't alarming, just very physical). I do know some though who are able to take full-blown visionary doses and still describe feeling entirely comfortable, so yes, I'm sure individual variations can make quite a difference. I'm hoping that maybe by the time I get to that intense of a trip I'll be too dissociated from my body for it to matter anyway!


And I'm excited to take the 100 mg as well. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) It should be pretty powerful after a bit longer of a time than normal since my previous trip as well.... One way or another, I'm sure that's going to be an experience to remember. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I must thank you for making this observation about being fearless on 4-HO-EPT.... It prompted me to do a whole lot of reading on the interaction between common psychoactive drugs and reactivity to negative stimuli in the amygdala, which turned out to be incredibly enlightening and turn into a lot of cool new thoughts going around in my head. I won't just unload all of it here, but suffice it to say that I'm now incredibly interested in the few studies that have specifically shown that psilocybin decreases this reactivity in the both the right and left amygdala, though with some selectivity for the right, and the same seems to be true of MDMA and citalopram, implicating serotonergic mechanisms in this effect, and that this change appears to be correlated with positive emotional changes on both psilocybin and MDMA. Given that I have also found that among tryptamines increasing the bulk of the tail has a tendency to increase the potency of the psychological and emotional effects of these psychedelics compared to potency of their hallucinations for me, it's really making me wonder now if part of the difference is just that, like MDMA and citalopram, these psychedelics retain the ability suppress amygdala activity even at doses that become increasingly less hallucinogenic as you move up from one tryptamine to the next through the molecular bulk, and if that's why by the time you get to something like 4-HO-EPT you get to the point where they are very powerfully deactivated, causing things like fearlessness and serenity, altered visual focus and time perception since the amygdalae are also involved in regulating those, and also some increased sexual feelings as have been noted during lesion studies and correlating with the fact that these brain structures are also deactivated by sexual activity and orgasms, which of course also links back to my other ideas about just what type of euphoria these molecules can cause, and all even at doses which are just barely hallucinogenic.... That sure would be interesting if it's the case. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And yes, I very much agree on the trip report writing. It's quite fun and hopefully useful, as others who are less cautious than we are will not have to also deal with going into these substances as blind as we are!

Alright, this is happening tomorrow.... 100 mg of 4-HO-EPT. It'll be my first trip in about two months, and the setting will be considerably better than I normally have access to, so I think it'll probably be about as good as I can make it.

Hopefully the location is a secluded nature place. Most of your TR's I've read have involved clubs or being at home I think. So outside would be the logical conclusion.

I feel you, believe me, I really do. It's been way too long since I tripped in that kind of setting and I need to get back to it. Unfortunately, there's just no way in hell I could convince myself to take the highest dose on record of a brand new drug in any sort of setting where I wouldn't be able to receive medical attention almost instantaneously. My paranoid sense of self-preservation would just be screaming at me the entire time, including during the trip itself.


A few years ago I came up with an unbreakable rule for myself, that I would never, ever take any dose of any substance without being in a private home, but with plenty of people nearby, with every possible need I could possible hope for (showers, air conditioning, food, whatever), and with a medicine cabinet stocked full of potentially life-saving pharmaceuticals, until I know exactly (within reason of course) how I'm going to react to it. And the thing is, I've just gotten my hands on so many different substances to try as of late that for the last couple of years practically every single trip I've had has fallen into that category, and those just happen to be the trips I've also been around to write reports about. Thus, they've all been at home. The upside of it though, is that I also have quite a lot of almost all of those substances I've been collecting to work with, enough to last me many years, so once I have worked through them the first time and cycle back to the beginning, things will be able to start getting a lot more interesting. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) And I think those reports might end up being a good bit more entertaining anyways, since for those experiences I'll also be able to focus more on getting into the trip itself, as opposed to documenting the effects of the trip as I tend to do for my first couple times.


The reason that the setting today is better than normal is because, rather than being in my cramped apartment with limited resources, so-so air conditioning, without the complete comfort to be as loud and ridiculous as I want without disturbing neighbors, and nowhere to go outside without being directly in the public eye, this time I'll be at my parents' house while they are out of town. Much to the contrary, here I can find almost any sort of modulatory pharmaceutical I could need, I know there are friendly neighbors, the food and drinks are stocked up like crazy, the air conditioning feels fantastic, there's way more space to move around in, I can be as loud as I want without drawing any serious attention, and there's a beautiful backyard to walk around for when I do need my outside fix. So, it may just be at home still, but it's certainly better than my usual!


And thanks! I'll be jumping into it fairly soon and I'm pretty pumped. :D

Welp, I was not wrong.... This has been an extremely illuminating experience. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


It's going to take me a while to really put my thoughts into words about the whole thing, even just in general but especially to the point of writing a trip report about it.... I'm still feeling it pretty strongly at the moment too, but I'm beyond the point now where I think anything new is going to happen, and where despite still feeling it I'm practically sober compared to the intensity of the peak. And that's saying something I think, because even the peak felt relatively sober in a lot of ways.


One way it absolutely did not feel sober, though, was in the sheer intensity of the general feeling of distortion from reality. This trip was no joke.... Don't be fooled by the lack of hallucinations or delirium or anything people, this drug will ramp up fast as the dose increases. I would say that this felt most comparable in intensity to my experience on 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT, but a bit more even. This also makes it notably distinct from 4-HO-DPT, which despite still being similar to this hallucinogenically I think, is nowhere near this extreme-feeling of an experience at 100 mg orally. I would definitely say, as I've suspected before, that this one needs to be treated somewhere in between 4-HO-DPT and most of the rest of the tryptamines in terms of overall potency.


But, for now I'll leave the rest for when I've had a bit more time to reflect on it all.... I definitely want to make sure I do the experience justice, so others will know exactly what they're getting themselves into when they take this kind of dose.


Stay safe, explorers. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Please update us more, Id like to dive in to 100mg territory of 4-HO-EPT!

No problem as always Volsam, I'm happy to contribute. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) And yes, serious is quite right.... I will definitely not be approaching this dose so lightly in the future, though I absolutely will explore it again!


As promised, here is the completed trip report:


[(4-HO-EPT/100 mg) - Fourth Time - Reaching The Breaking Point](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/813198-(4-HO-EPT-100-mg)-Fourth-Time-Reaching-The-Breaking-Point?p=13914668#post13914668)


I would suggest giving it a very thorough read before planning any such doses yourself.... This is certainly something you'll want to be as safe and prepared as possible for, assuming you have a sensitivity to it similar to myself.


And when you do, I would very much like to hear what kind of effect it has on you as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Can you make a comparison of potency relative to other tryptamines? I'm planning on trying 4-HO-EPT soon and I want to experience the full effects, but nothing too intense. 15-20mg of other 4-HO tryptamines is usually enough for me. I'm thinking I might try 40mg of 4-HO-EPT.

I'll certainly do my best, but I have to say that I won't feel *quite* as confident about it as I would with most other tryptamines, mostly because 4-HO-EPT seems to be fairly unique compared to the rest of them for me. At least, even though it tends to work within the same realm of effects as the others as usual, the ratios of those effects to one another makes its uses a bit different from most for me. But, here's what I would say....


For open eye visuals, its potency is very similar to 4-HO-DPT and 4-AcO-DALT, more so than anything else. All of these for me only start being particularly geometric at doses at or nearing 100 mg. Really though, if open eye visuals are your goal you might want to look elsewhere for now.


For closed eye geometric visuals and physical stimulation, I would say that its potency seemed to me to be about half that of 4-HO-MPT and a fourth that of 4-HO-MET. In other words, 25 mg of 4-HO-MET, 50 mg of 4-HO-MPT, and 100 mg of 4-HO-EPT all got me to a similar place with these effects, not just in intensity but also in design.


For closed eye visions and mental stimulation, I would say that its potency feels somewhere in between 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MPT for me, as even 25 mg was capable of providing these effects for me, though the visions come primarily when meditating. My 65 mg dose was capable of pushing them into that sort of mind's eye vision that you can actually see in a way, but it still wasn't the most vivid thing ever, though beautiful when it appeared.


For ego loss, so far I would say that it appears to maybe be about half as potent as 4-HO-MiPT, since my 100 mg dose of 4-HO-EPT was similarly extreme feeling in that way to 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT. However, unlike 4-HO-MiPT, I also find that it provides access to the "white light" at a significantly lower dose if you let it, as I was able to see it through meditation even as low as 25 mg.


Ultimately, I think I would have to say that 4-HO-EPT has given me the trips that are most different from the other 4-substituted tryptamines so far, and I find it weirdly comparable in potency to both the most potent and the least potent of the others I've tried, so even these effects I've observed on these doses so far I would say could be subject to change with future trips. However, if you are normally good with 15-20 mg of other tryptamines, then I'm sure 40 mg would at least give you a good taste of this one, regardless of what direction it takes. It might be worth taking Volsam's advice and bumping up to at least 50 mg if you really want to be sure you'll get something, but I say that mostly because we just don't really know what most peoples' sensitivity to this one will be right now since so few people have reported on it. Given that though, it probably wouldn't hurt to have some caution either. 40 mg would probably be fine if you have a good amount of it to work with, though if you only have a little then I might suggest just pushing a little further too just to make sure you get the most of it.


I hope that helps!

No problem, and I'd bet that will be a good dose then. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Honestly, the only dose I've taken that I would describe as crazy is 100 mg. While definitely not feeling shallow, 4-HO-EPT has been a very easygoing psychedelic overall for me so far. Its depth has been more about what I can do with it, rather than what it can do with me, if that makes sense.

I just got some 4-HO-EPT and decided to test it by snorting about 5 mg.  It didn't burn at all. The effects were mild, but actually a little  stronger than I had expected. I can't say much that much about the  nature of the trip yet, but I feel like it will be pretty nice at a full  dose. The headspace is unique. I would describe it as very cozy and comforting. The  visuals are mild but nice. No patterns or anything, but everything looks soft and fuzzy. There is kind of a dark purple aura around everything. 4-HO-EPT doesn't seem to have the speedy 4-HO-DPT body load. I'm really looking forward to trying a full dose.

Thanks for that cj187, sounds promising. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's cool to know that insufflation could produce activity with such a small dose. I was thinking about trying 25 mg by that route myself, after doing the same with 4-HO-DPT for comparison.


Looking forward to hearing about your full-strength trip!

Sounds very 4-HO-DiPT... soft and fuzzy check, not very potent check... is it comparable?

I think there actually are some pretty significant similarities between them. I would say that they're similarly potent mentally, with 25 mg of each being easy to handle but entirely engaging if you work with it, though 4-HO-DiPT reminds me more of mushrooms whereas 4-HO-EPT feels more like LSD. Neither of them are very visual at all for me at this dose, but of what is there 4-HO-EPT is more colorful and alike other straight alkyl synthetic tryptamines like 4-HO-MET, as compared to 4-HO-DiPT which I find darker and stranger, but also containing more vivid cartoon imagery. 4-HO-DiPT also has a bit of a lush or empathogenic vibe to it that I have found in other isopropyl tryptamines but generally not ones without it. And I know some don't, but I also get DiPT-like auditory distortions exclusively on 4-HO-DiPT. On the other hand, 4-HO-DiPT also gives me a lot of stomach discomfort that I could do without, whereas 4-HO-EPT has generally felt quite smooth.


Are you thinking about giving this one a shot soon? I'd love to hear what you think of it, and especially if you'd be comparing it to things like 4-HO-DiPT! That's one I'm definitely interested in understanding more too, unfortunately I'm going to run out after having only maybe three or four experiences total.

Sounds interesting! But pretty expensive. I don't expect to be able to afford it - first just acid and ETH-LAD probably.

Yeah, it's definitely not cheap, but probably worth at least a trial if you ever get the chance. I was lucky enough to have some pocket change to spare when it first showed up, my supply will probably last me a pretty good while. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ETH-LAD is definitely cool too though! That's one I really need to explore more as well, I got a sheet but I've only taken it once.... Would love to hear your thoughts on that one too, it seems pretty intriguing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's a shame that it's apparently going away too, it's certainly worth stocking up now while you have the chance.

I had my first real 4-HO-EPT trip today, and I have to say it's a real  winner. I mixed about 50mg into a glass of water and drank it, and  within 10 minutes I was already feeling it. The effects became strong  within half an hour. The headspace was nice, very calm and lucid.  Contrary to Kaleida's experiences, I got a good amount of open eye  visuals. Things were wavy and morphing, and I got a lot of tracers. The  body high felt great. Overall, I would have to describe as very gentle,  both mentally and physically.


I have to disagree with the  comparisons to 4-HO-DPT. I found them to be very different. I would say  that 4-HO-EPT is more comparable to 4-HO-DET, yet I think 4-HO-EPT is  superior to both. 4-HO-EPT is also much better than EPT.


 I'm  actually surprised 4-HO-EPT is as good as it is. It's a little early to  say, but in comparison to the other tryptamines, I think it might be my  second favorite after mushrooms. It gave me less physical discomfort  than any of the others. It's very neutral. There's no heavy sedated  feeling, and it's not really stimulating. The headspace is very  positive. It's calm and peaceful without any hint of darkness. I didn't  experience any introspection, just a relaxing euphoria. Like 4-HO-DET,  the main drawback is the short duration.


50mg gave me some pretty  decent effects, but it was a little light. For someone trying this for  the first time, I would recommend taking at least 60mg. It's pretty tame  compared to other psychedelics, so there's no reason to start with a  low dose.


I haven't tried 4-HO-MPT yet, but after this  experience, it's at the top of my list of psychedelics to try. I think  I'll really like it.

Thanks for the update cj187! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Now I'm pondering combos to go with 4-HO-EPT, in my mind... 

Obviously, phenethylamines are first choice here, I'd want to try it with Mescaline and it's analogs. Perhaps will be good with some 2C-x compounds if I'd have any handy. Something tells me to try it with LSD or AL-LAD as well. Perhaps Harmaline for duration extension and reduction of 4-HO-EPT needed. What do you think guys?.. 8)

^ I'm right there with you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm usually really not that into psychedelic combinations honestly, but 4-HO-EPT just seems like it could probably really bring out the best in certain things.


I'd definitely love to hear about any phenethylamine combos you do with it! I really wish I could do it with those, but I'm sure I'll get a chance one day, at least with mescaline (which sounds great!). I may still end up trying it with DOC and DOPR when I have more experience with them though. I can't speak to AL-LAD either, but I will say that a combo with LSD sounds truly fantastic.... I can only imagine that it might bring out the best parts of the trip, possibly with much more color than normal too, without adding really any more of a challenge or body load or anything. It's definitely something I intend to do one of these days.... If you do try it you should certainly let us know how it goes! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) About using harmaline too, just be safe about it.... I haven't felt anything from 4-HO-EPT, or any 4-substituted tryptamine honestly, that would make me particularly afraid of the idea of mixing it with a MAOI, but that doesn't mean a danger doesn't exist, and this is a pretty new molecule still.... I personally wouldn't be the first one to do it, but someone has to be I suppose. If you do I would work up to it with small doses first though, and make sure you let people know where you are and what you're doing and all that.... Better safe than sorry!


One thing I've really been thinking about combining it with myself is 4-HO-MPT. As I said before, these two molecules, 4-HO-MPT and 4-HO-EPT, really are the most LSD-like of the 4-substituted tryptamines I've used, so I can't help but wonder how they might synergize and bring these qualities out of each other. They even capture different aspects more fully than one another, since 4-HO-MPT gives me incredibly LSD-like geometric visuals, confidence, and ego loss effects, whereas 4-HO-EPT gives me the most LSD-like visionary imagery and penetrating feeling of bliss. Despite that they both also have strong mushroom-like qualities too, so I really just think they could mix in so many interesting ways.... I hadn't really thought about it much before, but after cj187's post I've been thinking about how it could mix with 4-HO-DET too, that could be pretty interesting. There definitely is a certain  aspect to both that and 4-HO-EPT that I have found similar even with as little as 25 mg, particularly as it came out during the white light visions.... It feels like they both touch on something a bit deeper than your typical classical tryptamine euphoria, and more neutral. So I think it would be really interesting to try those together too, and if they really synergize in those ways then I think that would really speak even more for 4-HO-EPT's versatility as well, as I would imagine that could be a pretty deep trip....


Yeah, those'll probably be what I try it with first, and LSD.

I just remembered something interesting about my trip that I forgot to mention. During the peak of the trip, I looked at myself in the mirror, in dim lighting, and my pupils looked normal. So it seems that 4-HO-EPT has an affinity profile that's different from most other psychedelics. It certainly feels very unique, while still feeling like a tryptamine. Of course, it could have just been a fluke. I'm curious if other people have noticed the same lack of pupil dilation from it.

I honestly don't get much pupil dilation from much of anything anymore, so I can't really comment on that directly. I do find that to be a really interesting observation though.


Do you normally check your pupils on tryptamines? I'm curious because there's something I've actually been thinking about constantly for the last couple days.... I've realized that, among some other things, one of the most defining activity trends I've found among indoles can divide them into two significant categories: methyls and non-methyls. I've tried a pretty good amount from each group now.... From the former I've used DMT, MET, MiPT, mushrooms, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-McPT, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MET, 5-MeO-MiPT, and LSD, whereas from the latter I've used DiPT, DALT, 4-HO-DET, 4-HO-EPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DET, 4-AcO-DALT, 5-MeO-DALT, and ETH-LAD. Across both categories there is a lot of diversity, with substances from either ranging from sedating to stimulating, clearheaded to highly mental, weakly to strongly visual, and so on, but there is one consistent completely obvious and unavoidable difference between them for me....


Specifically, every single one of those methyl indoles has had me for me, to some extent, a manic, grandiose feeling of excitement and love, the kind that makes the world beautiful and rosy and full of meaning and possibility. On the other hand, this feeling has been specifically lacking in every single one those non-methyl indoles for me. For me the difference is most obvious in my response to music, which is completely stimulated versus completely calm with each respective type of drug, but it's noticeable in a lot of ways really. This is one of the reasons that I consider these substances so unique, because even structurally unrelated molecules like 2C-I and DOC seem to touch upon the same methyl mania for me and I feel that that's why they were explored, as their series produce effects similar to the classic psychedelics, but these indoles really seem to take things in a new direction by sacrificing that while leaving the rest of the psychedelic potential instead. I feel that they're basically like a class of uniquely down to earth or "sober" psychedelics, and I know I'm not the only one to take note of this, as it's often stated about ETH-LAD, 4-HO-DPT, and so on.


Anyway, I found this all very interesting in particular in relation to what you say about pupil dilation now too, because I honestly pretty much associate dilated pupils with feeling almost deliriously high, the way that the methyl indoles make me feel but the non-methyl indoles, including 4-HO-EPT, do not. So, I'm wondering if there could be some connection there too?

I usually notice pupil dilation when I trip. I often look at my eyes in the mirror once I start feeling the effects of a psychedelic. It makes me feel excited and optimistic about the trip. It's like seeing a cat when it's eyes are huge because it's excited, except it's me.


I haven't noticed a pattern of methyl vs non methyl psychedelics, although I don't have much experience with most of them. I don't think there's a correlation between methyl indoles and pupil dilation because DPT gives me big pupils.

Hmm, interesting. I haven't tried DPT myself to compare, but from what I've read about it I feel it's extremely likely that it will also fit into the pattern I've noticed, so I'd guess there must be some other reason behind the pupil dilation differences then. Well, I do find 4-HO-EPT kind of unique even among the other non-methyls, so I wouldn't be too surprised to learn that it has some unique pharmacological differences too.


That's funny about looking at yourself in the mirror, I love it when cats look like that so that does sound fun lol.

Had mixed it with Harmaline and bunch of others... Had a sublime trip! :D 

Here's the link - [http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/815...-Self-Excited-Circuit?p=13949905#post13949905](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/815634-(Harmaline)-(Mescaline)-(4-HO-EPT)-(MPT)-(DMT)-Experienced-Self-Excited-Circuit?p=13949905#post13949905)


IMO, Harmaline goes very well with 4-HO-EPT. I'd like to try 150mg of Harmaline and 40mg of 4-HO-EPT next time, without addition of any other psychs, to get the true experimentation value!

I tried smoking this one for the first time today, 25 mg in a bowl of cannabis. I can't say how effective the technique was or anything, but I can at least say that the effects I felt were pretty nice, though not strong by any means. I just put up a trip report, a bit shorter than my usual ones. It can be found here:

You didn't mention converting it to freebase, so I'm assuming you smoked it as the fumarate salt. If you decide to smoke it again, you might want to consider adding a bit of baking soda and a few drops of water. I think you could get a stronger effect from the same amount that way. Smoking tryptamines as a fumarate salt seems to burn a lot of it.

Yeah, I just smoked it as is, which I believe is the fumarate. I've never actually freebased anything before, do you mean literally just add that to the dose right before smoking it? I never figured it could be that simple, but I really just haven't looked into it before.


I'm curious about tryptamine fumarate salts re: smoking. Do you have any scientific data to actually support that? I've heard that claim before, but I'm not completely convinced yet. 4-substituted tryptamines are supposed to be bad for smoking anyway for their own reasons so that could have just contributed to this too. MET fumarate on the other hand seems pretty much just as potent as it should be compared to freebase when smoked so far, at least based on what I've read. Apparently some people smoke DMT fumarate without issue too.

Hmm, wondering about the whole freebase tryptamines thing now, how much of it is true when vaping/smoking. You've cast something I thought I knew about tryptamines into the shadow of doubt. Seems to be the case with DPT. DPT HCl doesn't smoke/vape well at all. I have 4-HO-EPT salt in stock now. Might try smoking it as well. Rather enjoy smoking things for some reason as an ROA when possible but the whole freebase it first was the prevailing wisdom of the day which I took mostly at face value.

I don't have any scientific evidence, but it seems to be true in my experience. I have smoked 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT as a salt on top of weed, and it left a lot of burnt residue and was less potent than it would be orally. I've smoked 4-HO-DPT as a freebase and the potency was increased. There are reports of 4-HO-MPT and 4-AcO-DET freebase being very effective smoked, but people who have smoked 4-substituted tryptamines as salts usually report a loss of potency. I have smoked DPT and EPT HCl out of a freebase pipe and it actually worked pretty well, but still left a small amount of burnt residue in the pipe.


The fact that you didn't get strong effects from 25mg smoked makes me think you burned a lot of it. Smoking something should make it several times as strong as eating it. Turning something to freebase is pretty easy. Just add some baking soda, then drop some water onto it. It will immediately start fizzing, then you can smoke it when it's dry.

Well, if you only have a little bit to work with it might save it for a more certain route of administration, but if you've got enough to go around I don't see the harm, and I'd love to hear how it goes if you try it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It definitely works, whether or not it's efficient in terms of potency. I'll certainly be trying it again at some point, but I've got enough 4-HO-EPT that I promise you I'll get sick of it before I run out anyway.

Well, that is interesting, but it's still not convincing. You don't have any experiences to compare for the same chemical? Comparing 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT to 4-HO-DPT really doesn't mean much since they wouldn't be expected to have any equivalency anyway. How do you know that 4-HO-MET freebase wouldn't be even less potent for, and 4-HO-DPT fumarate wouldn't be even more? For what it's worth, I have also smoked both 4-AcO-MET and 4-AcO-DET and found the former slightly less potent than oral whereas the latter was definitely much more potent, I can't say by how much only because it far exceeded my oral experience thus far. The difference between that and your story, though, is that they were both fumarates. So again, I'm not denying that it could very well be the case that fumarates generally don't smoke well either, I just still have my doubts.


I'm sure I did burn some of it, I laced it lower in the bowl than I usually like to and I got kind of lazy with the precision and speed half way through. I have heard that that is the problem with 4-substituted tryptamines in general though too, that they burn too easily, but again I also haven't seen much scientific data to back that up either. I'm sure there are multiple things going on here, I'm just not ready to settle on one explanation yet. I definitely will try freebasing it for comparison next time if it is that easy though, so thanks for that. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You're right, I haven't experimented enough to have any conclusive results, but so far the evidence seems to point toward freebases being better for smoking. I'll probably experiment with it a bit more though. If anything, I'd like to make the 4-HO tryptamines last longer, not shorter, but I'm interested in smoking them for science.

If you'll let me speculate a little without taking this as actual science... Say you dissolve 4-HO-EPT salt in acetone, apply to your weed carefully and let it evaporate completely with a blow dryer or something using all the proper precautions like avoiding inhaling fumes and realizing acetone is flammable. Now when you smoke the weed, the plant material burns and turns to ash, which is alkaline and could in theory freebase the tryptamines in-situ during the smoking. That might improve the efficiency of the vaporization rather than sprinkling it on the weed as a separate layer and no need to freebase the chemical. Any chemists care to speculate? I got a gram of this stuff and time on my hands

When you do, I'd love to hear all about your results. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Though I generally agree with the sentiment that 4-substitued tryptamines need to last as long as possible, there are sometimes exceptions that are worthwhile. I do think that 4-HO-EPT might still be pretty cool at a higher dose smoked for instance due to its detached, ethereal, and already relatively short-lived nature. That could make it kind of cool both alone and when peaking on longer-lasting psychedelics too.

well as a rule of thumb, ionic compounds (salts) have higher melting and boiling points than the corresponding freebase because of increased intermolecular interactions. if your compound is sensitive to burning and you try to evaporate a salt, because of the higher temperature needed, a portion of it might pyrrolyse in the process.


@levels I doubt that it would work that way. why not just freebase it beforehand? by the time ash has formed, your drug will be evaporated or burned as well. also, ash might not be basic enough to deprotonate NR2H+ in appreciable amounts.

Thanks @bagseed I lack proper chemicals,  apparatus and technique. Ash is primarily CaCO3  and K2CO3 (potash) by mass. Yes, there's potash in the pot ash. Since baking soda is used often for freebase prep, I was wondering if tryptamine HCl salt drive the formation of CaCl2 and KCl salt instead.

freebasing an amine is not something you need fancy equipment for. just dissolve your compound in water, add sodium hydroxide to get to ph 13, extract that with sonething like naphtha or petroleum ether and let your solvent evaporate. done.


separating the organic and aqueous phases can be done with a turkey baster or syringe, if you don't have s seperatory funnel. just do three organic extractions to get it all.

Yeah, I've freebased chems before, but had a string of bad experiments and sort of stopped doing anything home chemistry. 4-FA freebase was one of the nastiest things a human could ingest when I prepped it. When I tried making DPT oil freebase it was wet and splattered everywhere when I tried to smoke it. I freebased MDPV using stuffmongers tek. The guy ran for for president of the USA in the election and lost. I tried to extract DXM from syrup once, and it failed. There was nothing there. I stopped trying to do home chemistry experiments since neighbors get curious and stuff. Try to keep it real simple. I never was very good at laboratory procedures, even though technically I'm a chemist on paper.

I will likely be sampling this tomorrow. Unfortunately, I do not have too much to work with, thus I will likely be "taking the plunge" to make the most of what i have~ From what I have read I am very eager to taste the effects of this particular chemical... The safety profile seems to align with the rest of the 4-sub-tryptamines. 

Would a dose of 75 mg oral be substantial? 


Also what is the consensus on bodyload for this one, especially with regards to GI effects? I haven't been able to dig up too much.

75 mg oral should be plenty satisfying if you're hoping for the kind of experience that has generally been reported so far. That is to say: delicious body buzz, euphoric and slightly dissociated headspace, time dilation, sensory and imagination enhancement, but not too much in the way of hallucinations or thought disorder. The closest dose I took to this was 65 mg, and it basically felt like having a very satisfying LSD trip, more than almost any other research chemical for me, but without having to go through almost any of the actual trip for it. There was no significant body load to speak of at this point or any below it.


My experiences with 25, 40, 65 mg oral were definitely the most enjoyable for me, but I will say as well that my experience with 100 mg oral, among other things, also leads me to suspect that there is a second kind of trip hidden within this drug as well, one that does not appear until you start dosing it more like 4-HO-DPT and is much stronger as a hallucinogenic experience, but like that one also may run the risk of producing an uncharacteristically heavy body load for a 4-substituted tryptamine at that point. That's what I'm going to try to investigate next myself, and for that I'll probably try like 50 mg insufflated or something....


These thoughts make me feel the need to point out that if you want to explore this side of it and don't plan to get more any time soon you might want to consider something more like that instead, but if you're happy to get the kind of experience that seems to be common on oral experiences with at least less than 100 mg, then go for it, 75 mg should be fine.

Thank you for the reply! You seem to be the foremost expert on this substance for now~ how I wish i had more to work with ... I'll be doing my 75 mg later today after I take a final, ill report back with notes and then a full report in the near future (still working on that escaline report from last week...)

4-HO-DPT body load is a phrase that just reflexively makes me recoil, yikes, that would be something I'd be keen to avoid but perhaps that issue would only arise with the insufflated ROA. I should have enough left to experiment with insuff in the near future but I'll see how oral treats me first :3

Wow, really? That sucks, and is unexpected.... Even when I took 100 mg those aren't the kinds of side effects I got, it was mostly things like tension that felt like maybe vasoconstriction and labored breathing. Like how bad of convulsions and high heart rate are we talking?


Obviously there is still quite a lot we don't know about this molecule.... I wouldn't have expected that bad of a body load from that dose, but it's pretty hard to make predictions with so little information. The best I can say is that it does seem to me like it's pretty unique, so we probably should be more wary of unexpected surprises as well....

I'm surprised you had that kind of reaction to it. I didn't experience any kind of discomfort from 50mg and I imagine 75mg would still be comfortable. There must be some other factor that contributed to those side effects. Was the trip pretty intense in other aspects, or just the body load?

I would say this is one of the most powerful psychedeliic experiences I've had, across my whole range of 75 substances...............

Im still in the midst of it and have a lot to unpack, maybe its some sortta sensitivity for me. It was absolutely reality shattering entity contact sort of stuff, I'll write about it later

no discomfort other than the wicked convulsions, thats what I found most alarming , but nothiig in the GI or other peripheral stuff

How sure are you that it was actually 4-HO-EPT?

Interesting.... This is actually exactly what I would've expected you to say if you had insufflated it instead. I absolutely think that the effects I got from 100 mg oral suggested that 4-HO-EPT was one of the strongest drugs I've ever taken, with the potential for complete breakthroughs and entities and such like you say, but it was still just at the threshold for that kind of trip. I'm kind of jealous, I'd say yeah, it sounds like you must just be much more sensitive to it by weight than we are.


I'm very curious about these convulsions.... Were they genuinely like seizure-like convulsions or was it just like extremely strong tremors? The latter would be more understandable to me, I get them on all 4-substituted tryptamines in high doses, and there doesn't seem to be anything dangerous about them, no matter how unsettling they get. But if it's actual convulsive activity then that's a bit more concerning....

I've never had a seizure before so I'm not sure what its like but my whole body woudl tense up and my appendages would move around a  ton. I don't think I seized up, but also my appendnages were just moving uncontrollably, knees contracting, ankles contracting, 


Im srry I didn'tt get a numerical read of heart rate, but I'll just say it was worrisome


This is a total mystery to me too, the safety profile of N substituted tryptamines and their respective 4-subbed analogues is pretty consistent and this one's structure fits in perfectly with the others

Move around like sudden jerking or move around like shaking heavily? The former would be worrisome to me, the latter not so much. With most 4-substituted tryptamines 25 mg used to be plenty to make my whole body shake to an extreme degree during the first part of the trip, though it got less common the more I used them. I don't believe this effect is dangerous, just uncomfortable, sometimes even painful. However, it's never done me any damage, and strangely it usually disappears with even higher doses.


If you were actually jerking around weirdly, that might be another story. It's true that 4-substituted tryptamines seem generally safe, but that doesn't mean we'll never hit any limits with them no matter how different they get.... I do think it's worth considering though that even if it was genuinely seizure-like activity that doesn't necessarily mean that the 4-HO-EPT is primarily to blame. Bupropion for instance is well-known to lower the seizure threshold.... How long have you been on it while using psychedelics?


Thanks for the warning about the heart rate too. I don't doubt that it was increased significantly, but it is hard to say how worrisome that really is without an actual reading.... I could barely measure or comprehend my heart rate at all at 100 mg and in retrospect I'm pretty sure it was barely different at all, so if you were tripping hard enough to get your heart pounding like it sounds like you might have been I can imagine it seeming like a very extreme situation.... Not trying to say it wasn't either, just considering all the different angles here. This is definitely the kind of thing I'd like to have some confidence about when planning out future trips....

A mix of both, there was a baseline of just constant violent shaking with all of my limbs and body, but sometimes it would lapse into episodes of them  uncontrollably and rhythmicly contracting and me unctrollably contorting myself into weird positions. 

I wasn't sure if this was worrisome or a sign of bad convulsive effects so i dosed with a benzo just to abort the experiment out of caution

I was aware of the Bupropion lowering my seizure threshold, but in all my experiennces with a wide range of tryptamines I have never had such a problem, even when i was on a higher dose of Bupropion.

Nowadays I take bupropion intermittently, I find its most effective that way at improving mood/focus/energy, just a few times a week, and I took a 300 mg dose this morning


The gabapentin is prescribed for anxiety and as an anticonvulsive so i tapped into that too


I would be eager to explore with this one, absolutely fascinating headspace and ethereal experiences, but definitely caution my way with much lower doses, perhaps during one of the gaps I take in my medications (that's a whole nother thing that I can elaborate on if necessary lol)

Oof, that doesn't sound good.... Not fun at the very least. Yeah, the baseline of shaking sounds like what I was describing. The other stuff, well I'm not educated enough to really say what it does sound like exactly, but it doesn't sound like anything I've ever at least personally experienced with these tryptamines. I mean, I've twisted into all kinds of bizarre shapes on tryptamines, but not uncontrollably like that.... I'd say taking that benzo was probably the right idea at least for now.


I suppose you can elaborate on the gaps in your medication.... That probably would be a wise idea when experimenting with these chemicals though as long as it doesn't cause any problems for you in its own right. It's good that you haven't had any negative interactions with bupropion and tryptamines before, but that certainly doesn't mean it will remain safe forever or with all tryptamines, and based on what bits of information I do know about seizures, I would also be afraid that you might become more sensitive to it over time if you let yourself get into that state repeatedly.... It's hard to say how the gabapentin would interact with it too, the intuitive thought might be it would block it through anticonvulsant effects, but it's ultimately really hard to say how all those different mechanisms combined will turn out in the end, and it's not unheard of for drugs like these kinds to do the exact opposite of what they're generally supposed to.... That's why I personally like to just limit the interactions as much as possible when doing these kinds of explorations, at least until I understand how something works in my body pretty well first.


I really do think this one feels special too, and I hope you're able to get something out of it without having to deal with that heavy body load in the future.... I'll certainly be interested in hearing what you think about when you give it a try. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'll keep an eye out for this trip report too, I'd be very interested to hear how this one went in more detail if you do get around to writing it.

So does that mean you have a tendency to convulsions, the fact that you're prescribed gabalentin?  Just wondering as it may at least be relevant.

Yeah I'm not sure. Perhaps similar effects would be felt if I had done proportionately high doses of other tryptamines, although this doesn't seem like an exorbitant dose? 

The headspace of this drug was like nothing else though I'm certainly excited to explore its potential, just in a more contained way perhaps

Nah it was prescirbed for anxiety and to compliment the original prescription of bupropion, given that one's tendency to lower seizure threshold

Tried this one at 30mg orally in a gel cap the other night after an earlier allergy test and marquis reagent. Reagent colour matched the light olive transitioning to very dark olive, almost identical to the results I got from 4-ho-dpt.


Very little in the way of visuals but as you guys have said the headspace is amazing, I found it a useful tool with an amazingly positive afterglow, still riding the glow now two days later.


it has given me the push I need to give up alcohol. Never a massive drinker just drank for the sake of it and it was doing me no good.


Very similar to 4-ho-dpt as it has been said before. I did get some nausea which I don't normally get on tryptamines but that may have been due to spending 4 nights in Amsterdam and over doing everything ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) as you do. 


I will I'll try this one again soon with some 4-ho-met or aco-met as that makes everything nice.

Nice one! I really think the tryptamines tend to have an anti-addiction property. Not that you were addicted it sounds like, but these drugs just seem to put addictive and unhealthy substances and habits in the light and you can see them more clearly for what they are. And I think they do give a bit of an urge to not turn to them, and some extra willpower to resist during the long tail of the afterglow.


A 4-AcO-DMT trip helped me get over some slight overeating and over-drinking I was doing.

 Yeah I used a massive 12g dry cubensis trip (experienced users only) to quit nicotine. I took the dose in a dark room and led down and focussed on my addiction. I saw a glowing ball that was black in the centre, I felt like the ball was my addiction. I wanted to be free of it so kept thinking that. The ball exploded into loads of tiny pieces and I lost my sense of self. When I woke the next day I didn't want to smoke and haven't since, been 4 years now. I use a vaporizer for cannabis still but no combustion since that experience. 


Now let me caveat that what I did above could be Dangerous and i had no idea what effect it would have. I choose the correct setting, at home in bed with no visitors planned.


I have a very addictive personality and felt myself slipping with regards to alcohol. I am lucky that tryptamines give me the insight to see when I am on a slippery slope. I use them every couple of months  and take long breaks, and the fact they are not habit forming for me is great.

Awesome. Iboga/ine is probably the most famous (and powerful?) for scrubbing out addiction, but surely these other tryptamines share some of this power, and they may be safer as well.

I completely agree, and find it noteworthy that you mentioned 4-AcO-DMT: I've always sworn that 4-AcO-DMT is the most powerfully anti-addictive psychedelic I've personally taken (I have not used iboga), and is was even shown to have anti-addictive properties in an animal study.

So I just found some 80 mgs of this in my drug stash... how is it like in combinations? Ald-52 in particular?

^ Oops, for some reason I thought this was the 4-AcO-DMT thread. Disregard the previous comment. I have actually tried 4-HO-EPT in combination with ALD-52, and found the synergy quite interesting. The 4-HO-EPT seemed to smooth out a bit of the manic edge of the ALD. I can't suggest a dose, since I only tried it once at a conservative dosage, but if I were to try it again, I think I'd go for something like 20 mg 4-HO-EPT on top of however much ALD-52 I felt like taking.

I tried a 60mg dose of 4-HO-EPT yesterday and it actually felt considerably stronger than when I took 50mg. I thought a higher dose might be more enjoyable, but the trip was uncomfortable during the peak. I thoroughly enjoyed the body high last time, but this time I felt uncomfortable. I felt overstimulated and experienced some nausea and weird stomach sensations. It was definitely more intense mentally too, but not in a way that made it better.


I started to think that maybe 4-HO-EPT isn't as great as my first impression led me to believe, but once the effects started to diminish, the trip became very much like what I experienced during my 50mg trip. 4-HO-EPT has a very content, meditative headspace. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that some other psychedelics have, but it doesn't need them. The visuals aren't as impressive as many other psychedelics, but visuals aren't what tripping is all about. Mentally, it doesn't take you as far out as other drugs either, but it's undeniably psychedelic. It isn't introspective, at least not in a way that makes you think about aspects of yourself and your place in the world.


What it does do is put you in a living-in-the-moment state of mind. That's the thing about tripping that I always found to be the most important. Long ago, when I first started tripping, I started reading about various psychedelics on Erowid, and the one that I wanted to try the most was 4-AcO-DiPT. One report in particular, titled "Tripping for Grownups" made it sound appealing to me. It describes the trip as being very psychedelic, comparable to mushrooms or LSD, but without the fireworks, just pure psychedelic experience. I still haven't had the chance to try it (I wish I hadn't been scared to order research chemicals back then), but 4-HO-EPT seems similar to that. 


Usually when I trip, I listen to a lot of typical psychedelic music like Pink Floyd. On 4-HO-EPT, I've found that the ideal music to listen to is stuff like Gabor Szabo, Cal Tjader, Rabih Abou Khalil. That kind of music matches with the headspace perfectly. Szabo's album Dreams in particular is one that I would recommend listening to.


4-HO-EPT is a fairly light psychedelic, but I think it's everything it needs to be. It's like mushrooms or LSD without the craziness of the first half of the trip, but with the clarity and serenity of the comedown. I think now that 40-50 mg is an ideal dose. At first I thought 50mg was a light dose, but I now realize that 4-HO-EPT is just gentle by nature.

It sounds like you pretty much went through what I did when I bumped up the dosage from 65 to 100 mg; I was really hoping that it was going to suddenly burst through into something amazing, but it really stayed quite subtle no matter how far I pushed it, and even when it was surprisingly intense in its own way at the same time. I was a little bummed at first, mostly because I was just used to wanting to push my psychedelics as far as they could possibly go at the time, but I have come around since then mostly as I've realized that, like you said, that's just 4-HO-EPT's nature, and it is still undoubtedly awesome for what it is. I no longer hold it as close to the top of my list of favorites as I initially thought I might for this reason, but it definitely will always still hold a special place in my heart, and serve a unique purpose in my life, nonetheless. Thanks again for the thoughts. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As for 4-AcO-DiPT, I have not tried that one myself, but I have tried 4-HO-DiPT, and can say that I have pretty much always felt that it was indeed quite similar to 4-HO-EPT in some key ways. The most significant difference between them for me, I would have to say, is that whereas 4-HO-EPT feels to have a more LSD-like headspace, 4-HO-DiPT has a more psilocin-like one. 4-HO-EPT puts me very much in the sort of headspace you describe, where I'm living in the moment and generally just deeply satisfied in an instinctive way which I would tend to describe as spiritually refreshing, whereas with 4-HO-DiPT I actually do tend to get very introspective and analytical and critical of my own life choices in a way that is very much reminiscent of some of my strongest mushroom trips, though a bit less hectic. The two are highly similar however in the sense that while these head trips are happening there is very little else going on in the way of psychedelic fanfare, little mania or hallucination or body load or anything of the sort, really just a very pure and focused psychedelic trip. If that is the kind of experience you are looking for, I definitely think you could end up very much appreciating 4-HO-DiPT or its acetate ester in much the same sort of way as 4-HO-EPT.

The fact that they are similar makes me think that 4-HO-EiPT is probably great too. I'm actually going to finally try 4-AcO-DiPT soon so I'll get to see for myself how similar it is to 4-HO-EPT.

The pharmacology of tryptamines is extraordinarily different from ibogaine.  Tryptamines may offer help with addiction, nicotine, etc...but they do not cure physical addiction to opiates (for instance).  I spent a summer trying to beat suboxone with DMT and a bunch of synthetic tryptamines.  I did not succeed.


On the other hand...

So you still go through the same withdrawal, you're just not as scared of it.


It makes sense.  Fear of withdrawal is worse than the withdrawal itself sometimes.

It seems that different people metabolize 4-HO-EPT differently. I know someone who finds it no less potent than other 4-HO tryptamines and trips pretty hard from low doses. If you're trying it for the first time, don't take more than 20mg.

Been sitting on it for a while now and finally decided to try this for the first time this weekend. I weighed out 63 mg of the fumerate salt and took it orally around 10:45 am. By 11:20 am or so I noticed the first alerts. Body load was present but not particularly uncomfortable. Virtually no OEV's or CEV's. Psychedelia was definitely present but stayed somewhat superficial — as in not particularly immersive. There was a warmth to the psychedelic content which was notable, I felt this had real potential, but 63 mg wasn't strong enough for me to get transported. Prior to this experience I had previously tripped about 2.5 weeks prior so perhaps I had a bit of tolerance going into this. I'm still interested in trying this at a higher dosage. Perhaps at 100 mg this may shine a bit more though I expect the body load will increase along with the dosage. I really want to love this but I wasn't particularly impressed with this molecule; should try it a least once more before giving up on it.

I really like 4-HO-EPT but exclusively use it only with x-scalines or with alcohol, few times with DMT. I have no body load or any negatives from this molecule from dosages up to 50mg. 


Very comforting body feel, IMO 4-HO-EPT is an excellent stuff to take on a lonely cold evening! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Totally agree. I feel much same with 4-AcO-DPT and 4-HO-DPT. They are gentle by nature. Out of all the 4-AcO/4-HO-XXX the least gentle IMO is 4-HO/4-AcO-DMT.

4-HO-EPT is gently by nature for sure. It feels very calm and theraputic. I am coming down from 25mg, intranasl. I will report more in the morning. 


What's 4-HO-DPT like?

4-HO-EPT has proven to be a valuable substance producing a worthwhile experience, or trip. Its very clean feeling, no thrills, no fear, more subtle imagery, grace. I am able to just be, and to breathe, and be content just staring at the sky.


25mg intranasally produced wonderful effects this evening. The moon had a slightly haunted yellow hue, due to atmospheric conditions, it was so beautifully moody. The lunar glow reflected spectacularly off of the chromatic reflections of the bay. Like classic psychedelics, this substance produces more mild visual effects. Everything is traditionally shiny.


It's a very lucid trip. No push, even insufflated. Minimal body load. I had muscle tremors in my hamstrings for a bit, as a laid on my back staring at the stars. Breathing came very easy, and overall it feels like a therapeutic bath. Relaxation comes naturally on this substance.


Post peak, it felt almost like a roll. I have to admit, my best friend and I find that Tryptamines tend give MDMA roll like effects nowadays. One time, my partner combined sublingual harmalas on the tail end of a 4-Aco-DMT, with a definitive rushing, rolling feeling. But that's a story for another time.


This evening was spent out in a park that borders a bay, with green fields, palm trees, and a few scattered beaches. It's a Saturday night, and downtown is popping. People are drawn to the town center, and this waterside park goes mostly unnoticed.


My mind was recently weighed down by a verbal conflict with my father, but relieved that I had sent an apologetic text message. Heavy, but clear. 


I am a healthy, athletic 29 year old male with about a decade of experience with psychedelics. I have tripped on LSD(LSD, ALD-52, ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, 1P-LSD) over 100 times, tryptamines(mushrooms, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET,4-Aco-MET, 4-HO-EPT, DMT),  close to 100 if not 100 times. I have some experience with harmala alkaloid extracts. My body doesn't seem to like the two phenylethylamines I have tried, 2-CB, and bk-2-CB (lol what was a I  thinking? 20hr trips... I played soccer on it once, and beasted out though. hahaa).


I've done MDMA, MDA, Cannabis, of course. I've tried Xanax, Cocaine, Percocets, and Oxys. One time I tried Robitussin. Now I despise Alcohol.


Ketamine was pretty cool, and I feel slightly drawn to it. But now I prefer the more physically healthy feeling tryptamines more than anything, even LSD. I don't do anything but Tryptamines, Cannabis, LSD, and Harmalas. I won't do Kava or Kratom. I stick with stuff that gives me sufficient afterglow.


4-HO-EPT feels cleansing, healing, enlightening. Its like meditation in powder form. It won't throw you into another dimension, at least not at 25mg, but it will heal you and gently guide you towards your better self.


4-Aco-DMT, still remains my favorite. Nothing has the same power, pound for pound.


4-HO-EPT, feels useful, in a separate way. It's more functional and forgiving. Its "chill", but still feels like a reset.


A reset without the flairs. 


It has combined nicely with 4-Aco-DMT (26mg 4-Aco-DMT, 24mg 4-HO-EPT | What a trip! I had full body tremors!)


It also combined very nicely with 4-HO-MET at low doses, very social, giddy, and relaxed.


These substance seem most interesting to me now, on their own. I want to feel the full unfettered character of each substance, especially these rare tryptamines and lysergamides.


One of these days, I will even combine 4-HO-EPT with DMT. Has anyone done that yet???

I tried 4-HO-EPT again recently. I only took a little over 40mg but it  the effects were stronger than I expected. I had tripped the previous  day, which may have made the trip more intense.  I never get a tolerance  from psychedelics, and even seem to get a reverse tolerance. This trip  felt as strong as another time when I took 60mg. Then I smoked some  weed, which I don't do very often, and it got overwhelmingly intense for  a while.


There were a few notable differences from my previous trips with  4-HO-EPT. This time, it took a lot longer for me to feel the full  effects and it also seemed to last longer. I was tripping for at least 8  hours and still felt some minor effects for quite a bit longer than  that. It also felt more fully psychedelic. The weed is probably what  helped bring out the full trippiness. I was really impressed by the  visuals. Everything was covered in flowing geometric patterns and colors  were rich and intensely vibrant. I mentioned before that I didn't  notice any pupil dilation the first time I tried it, but my pupils were  quite dilated this time.


This was the first time I took it with other people. It's a nice drug  for a solo trip, but I see now that it's even better with other people  around. The calmness and clarity of the headspace really makes it easy  to be comfortable and open with people. I think it would be really  valuable psychedelic for use in therapy.


While the trip started  out overwhelmingly unpleasant, overall it was great experience that  solidified my opinion of 4-HO-EPT as being one of the most worthwhile  psychedelics. It also makes me want to start smoking weed more often  when I trip because it can really take things to the next level.

Yeah I don't always smoke weed anymore when I trip just because of how much more intense it makes it.  


I have yet to try any of the EPTs.  I have tried MPT and 4-HO-MPT and they're both pretty great, quite unique from other tryptamines too.

I want to try something new today, and I've settled on this, I'm going on a hike with my girlfriend and decided on 40mg orally, but ended up with 42 and since that's a great number, I stuck with it.  Will be leaving soon after a bit of food, and I'll take notes and write a report later. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tripped twice on 4-HO-EPT, really enjoyed it both times, a worthwhile tryptamine for sure, I took around 50mg both times which seemed to be a good level

Just posted my TR on this:


##### 4-HO-EPT (42mg, oral) - First Time - Intense Energy, Calm Contemplation

4-HO-EPT: Intense Energy, Calm Contemplation 11-27-2020 by Xorkoth  2:25pm (T+0:00) - I ingested 42mg orally at this point.  It was a fine, chalky powder, like basically all of the 4-sub tryptamines are.  Unlike the others, its taste is really surprising.  It first hit the tongue as a sweet...

My homie intranasally did 25mg of 4-ho-met before also intranasally doing 10 mg of 4-ho-EPT, he then did another 5 mg of EPT for good messure. He had an incredible time and felt its a whole different thing even compared to a 70mg 4-ho-met dosage.


Just curious to read if anyone else has trierd that combination or similar

Nope, never combined those.  I've only taken 4-HO-EPT the one time I wrote about in the report I linked.  Which I just re-read.  I'm awfully glad I have written so many reports, I would forget a lot of stuff if I didn't write it down. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's nice to somewhat re-live experiences from time to time.

Wow,I'd never be able to take a hike on 4HO-EPT. I tried it between 20-50mg and for me and my gf it's just couch stuff, looking at our garden/the sky. This is the case for me with most 4ho-tryptamines though. I find LSD and DOC suit me better as hiking drugs, although they have a lot longer duration of course.

3,5 hours after the peak I was back in every possible way and I found myself in the car getting some pizza.


I do feel, like you, its a gentle tryptamine with not too much visuals. Although 50mg had the floor swirling like only Tryptamines can do it.


For me its very meditative, relaxing and in no way conceptually challenging.


Love it and think its a very good introduction to tripping.
