## Subjective Experience

First introduced in the 1970s, and initially approved to treat epilepsy, gabapentin is
now prescribed to treat a number of ailments, including seizures, neuropathic pain
and restless leg syndrome. However, its anxiolytic and quasi-euphoric effects have
also led to its use as a recreational drug. I have seen it described as a mild benzo, but
with dramatically smaller returns on repeat doses during a session. It is also known
for tolerance to build very quickly.

My supply came in the form of 300mg capsules, which is handy given that most
online reference sources quote thresholds in multiples of 300. Given that some of
these suggest topping the first dose up after perhaps 30 minutes to an hour, I elect to
start with 300mg and then perhaps add another 300mg downstream. This should
pitch me well into common territory, but in two simple stages.

In terms of anticipation, I’m not quite sure what to expect. Further, I am torn with
contradiction: I am still tempted to go for a higher dose, yet at the same time I don’t
really consider this class of drug to be my thing. In the end, sense prevails.

```
T+0:00 I swallow a 300mg capsule with a glass of water. [1:00pm]
```
```
T+0:45 A heady mellow feeling is now emerging. It is minor at present, but
certainly noticeable.
```
```
T+1:30 I am not euphoric or uplifted, but that head driven aura referred to in
the last note is now well established. There are no fireworks, but my
headspace has been calmed, and anxieties have disappeared.
```
```
T+2:00 I remain in the same warm and softened zone as I decide to take my
usual afternoon nap. I have little problem falling into a sleep.
```
```
T+3:00 I am now awake again, and mentally I am back into a similar place.
There is a hint of physical analgesia with this, and the gentle ambience of the
sedation persists nicely. I eat and enjoy a decent meal.
```
```
T+4:00 The intensity has now reduced significantly, and despite having left it
much later than intended I am left wondering whether to redose. After some
consideration I open a capsule and take another 300mg.
```
```
T+5:30 I am experiencing a sort of cerebral numbness, but without a real
high. I feel tranquillised without being tired or weary. There’s been no obvious
kick from the second dose, but perhaps it has intensified the plateau.
```
```
T+8:00 Given the slightly unworldly sense that pervades vision, there is a
minor hypnotic feel in play. My hands remain a little numb too. The intensity
is now lower, but I remain in a gentle bubble of neutrality.
```
I retired to bed at about 11pm, 10 hours after the initial intake. The night’s sleep
wasn’t bad, and the headache that I thought I had in the middle of it wasn’t really
there in the morning, although I felt a bit flat. This flatness lingered all day.

I found this to be strongish at times, in a hypnotic rather than a euphoric sense. It
delivered both a mood and a physical numbness, which produced contentment
rather than enjoyment. This isn’t to say that it wasn’t a reasonably pleasant ride
though, and I should note that the second dose was totally unwarranted.

With respect to a comparison with benzodiazepines, it subjectively carried less lift,
although this could have been partly due to my prevailing mood and circumstance.
