I can't find ANY reports on this compound outside of Tihkal. The only information I am able to find about it is in the Tihkal entry for [4-HO-MiPT](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal22.shtml). 


....they both seem promising, but I'd like to hear some first hand accounts, as Shulgin focuses on 4-HO-MiPT, and doesn't go into much detail on the 4-AcO. Does anyone here have any experience with this substance?

I've done a really low dose(8mg) in the past but it did'nt do much as i was'nt intending it to and i've yet to give in a second go due to the fact that i experienced some body load on a sub-psychedelic dose although it was more of an intensification of already present body load from a binge on dope for a few weeks but it may be without bodyload on its own but i don't know.

First let me say that the whitish semi-crystaline material sticks to everything like glue. It seems to want to decompose into a goopy material with a quality like rubber cement. 


Second, lets be aware that some 4-aco-det on the market was tested and turned out to be 4-ho-det. Also some 4-aco-dipt on the market was tested and it turned out to be about 50/50 4-aco-dipt and 4-ho-dipt. So in other words its very possible what's on the market is actually 4-ho-mipt or a mixture.


Third, **don't eyeball this material.** When I first placed what I thought would be about 12 mg on the scale it turned out to be over 60mg!!


Anyways, 12mg of this material for me (200 lbs) produced a rather strongish 'shroomlike' trip. The visuals were fuller and richer than those of 4-aco-det but not quite like those of shrooms, i.e strong but different. The mental effects were intense and emotional like 4-aco-det or shrooms but not precisely like either. No recognizable body load or phsysical effects whatsover other than the usual effects of emotional intensity. Overall It was a very positive experience (mostly becuase of the presence of my wife, the worlds greatest trip sitter ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Didn't write a trip report. I spent most of the trip listening to music, vegging out and thinking wierd shit but did go out and walk around towards the end of the intense part. I would have gone out earlier but it being an experimental chemical I didn't know how intense it was going to get.

**4-Aco-MiPT**


So I got my sample of this compound only to discover that it is *VERY* hygroscopic. In fact, it resembles a glob of pine sap that has been too long in the hot sun... sort of runny/globby/sticky 'bit-o-crud' in a small plastic bag. I'll probably slit the sides of the bag open with a razor and soak in a ethanol solution as I'm told from the supplier it's still viable. Has anyone else had any experience with this compound and how did you get around it's hygroscopic character? Any experience reports?

The vendor shiped it to me in a plastic bag with a moisture absorber in it. It was still crystaline until I opened the bag. I then got it into a glass vial as fast as possible. To weigh it I used the bottom half of the gel cap as the tare. I tasted it at 12 and 18 mg and liked it very much. Haven't written a trip report but I might soon.

That sucks.  It will mean I won't be looking for this one until a new batch is made, one that does not absorb water from the air.  Nothing in TIHKAL mentions that the molecule is hygroscopic, and its relatives do not show this property.  I wonder if it is the result of a sloppy synth.

Shulgin did state 4-ho-mipt "discolors quickly if it is not kept in an inert atmosphere and in a freezer". He didn't say why. This is 4-aco-mipt btw and is probably a salt of it. Whether its hygroscopic or something else like oxidation is a vendor's speculation. The material worked quite well and I'm satisfied with it despite the inconvenience.

Maybe someone who has already tried the substance a few times, could weigh out a dose, and let it sit out in the open, not in the SUN or anything, but just out in a room, maybe in a capsule that is open.  Let it sit for a few weeks or longer, and when the person wants to trip on that dose, close up the capsule and eat it, and see if the effects are the same for the dose - to see if the 'goop' still works just as good after exposure to air for a few weeks.  If i get a sample of this I will definitely try this.


Now, it was mentioned dissolving it in ethanol, is this pure (like everclear maybe?), and would it be OK to store in the ethanol for long periods of time (freezer maybe)? (of course no one knows for sure since it is relatively 'new' on the market) What about an ethanol/water mix like vodka, i'm assuming that wouldn't be too good, unless stored in a freezer i suppose.


Does the 'goop' dissolve easily into the ethanol? Lets say, for measuring purposes? (250mg 4-aco-mipt into 25mL or whatever)


I've noticed big 'size' differences between certain substances, like 10mg of 2c-i is barely anything, but then (the batch i have anyway) the same amount of 4-ho-dipt "Iprocin" (I need to write a trip report on this great stuff, I think it along with some brainwave generator software "busted" me out of a depression, this one is up there with the few great ones RC or not) looks like a huge amount in a capsule, sort of 'mushy', same thing with 4-ho-det.

Will dissolving this compound in any water mix (str8 distilled water, or ethanol/water mix) cause it to be less stable? Also, would 90% isopropyl alcohol work as well for this purpose? Just b/c I have a bag of sap and no ethanol.

In terms of mental effects I found 4-aco-mipt to be not very much like 4-aco-dipt at all. On 4-aco-dipt even on high doses (as much as 40mg split in 2 20mg doses an hour apart) I can be pretty much be functional if I want to, i.e. I can focus and concentrate on doing things. On just 12mg 4-aco-mipt OTOH my short term memory was pretty much shot. Whenever I tried to actually do someting I would constantly be losing my train of thought and drifting off on tangents.

Yes I am also interested like a couple other posters, if anyone can say, if it is OK to dissolve 4-Aco-MIPT in water and/or ethanol, for measuring purposes or storage.  It turns into this goop quickly, but still seems to work fine, I may be getting some soon although my friend with the "real scale" is around occasionally, I am wondering about any "guesses" anyone has if this stuff would be stable in a solution over any good length of time.


I have had no problems storing AMT (freebase) in a vodka solution (1mL=10mg) for almost 2 years, tested by a friend a couple months ago and no noticeable loss of potency.  Also I've had 5-Meo-DIPT in a vodka solution (1mL=10mg) for even longer, still works like when I got it (of course, I disposed these down the toilet immediately after I heard about that emergency scheduling, this was all before that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png), both at room temperature, except during the hot summer days with no A/C they were a little extra warm ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I did not even attempt to dissolve 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-DIPT in a solution, but I wonder about the Aco versions?


So if i receive some 'goop' in a small vial, if no one has any answers, or 'a good guess', maybe I will borrow my friends good scale and just dissolve 50-100mg in a solution, dose a couple times, and leave it for a while and see how active it is in a few months...


Yes, I know, I should just buy my own damn scale, that Tanita 1210 (i think) is cheap, accurate enough from what i've read, although I want to see if there are any better/more accurate ones for around that price- before I do get one.

As far as putting it in solution is concerned, I don't see any advantage to that as far as stability is concerned. Sure the material is hygroscopic, meaning it absorbs so water from the air and becomes a sticky goop. But if you freeze it in that state you're still solidifying all the molecules which is a better protection from degradation than any solution. To weigh my doses I just used the bottom part of a gel cap as a tare by weighing it first, and then used a small tipped screwdriver to place the material inside the cap. If you must use a solution to weigh your doses due to lack of a scale, I'd say use distilled water and then separate and freeze individual doses. Little is know about how stable this material is.

My friend recently took 18 mg of this 4-AcO-MiPT orally and he said this "My floor moved in rolling waves. I seemed to exist outside of my environment."


Here's his summary: Extremely visual, not terribly introspective (though I’m sure it is possible), slight body sickness, slight body trip.

I have recently received a sample of 4-AcO-MiPT, it is a brownish crystals, with a few large "clump" clusters that seem very hard. I could not crush the clump with my fingers through the plastic baggie. I decided to store it inside a second sealable baggie inside a tupperware container in the freezer. Has anyone else seen it this color?

I can say with 99% confidence that all of the 4-AcO-MiPT on the market was made by one chemist, who sold it to the varying people who sell it.  For some reason, this batch is very hygroscopic (absorbs moisture) and that's what happens to it; it becomes clumpy, sticky, and brown.  I managed to work with some still pretty fresh and made the mistake of opening the bag and it went from powerdy to gooey in a few minutes.  But this seems to have no effect on potency or CNS effects.  It's just a bitch to weigh on a scale.

This compound is my new found favorite. No body load, not even a tinge of nausea during the come-up. I always puke on psychedelics, always. It has a nice body high to it, not unlike MDMA, but not as energetic. It's erotic, I couldn't keep myself occupied enough in that sense, and it's VERY visual. This is one to do in the dark, I took it during the day and was disappointed with the visuals... However, upon going in the bathroom and turning off the light..... Marvelous!


It seems to last about 4-6 hours. But this is my first experience with it so we'll see. I'm not going to bother putting up a trip report, I didn't do anything all that exciting. This was just a curious taste that yielded awesome results. The real trip is yet to come.


And curiously enough, it didn't goop in the vial, it was a brown sugar looking crystal, and when I put it in the capsule, it didn't goo there either. But as soon as I put some in the pipe to smoke, it melted. Almost as though it knew its fate. And the vial is still a crystal, it's rather odd.


To answer the question that some of you may have had, this IS smokable, though I can't say what level it is active at. Probably about the same as oral, but that's speculation.


I edited this post: apparently I'm still intoxicated, it comes in waves. I typed 6-10 hours for duration, when I meant 4-6... It's a brief one, unfortunately. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hey, glad to hear there is another fan of this compound.  While it isn't my favorite, I totally agree with the lack of body load, especially when smoked.  I personally prefer to eat it, but I have tried smoking it a couple times.  The times I smoked it I had a nice mellow trip for about 3-4 hours, conciderably shorter than when I eat it.  For some reason smoking also feels like it has a lower ceiling than eating it does.  This is sort of hard to explain, but smoking 10mg definatly gets me to a nice ++, but eating this amount would give me a +/slight++.  But eating 20mg gets me to a solid +++.  However, smoking 20mg(in 10mg sessions about ten minutes apart) didn't really do that much more than the 10mg.  This may just be me, or I may not be smoking it correctly, but since I have stuck to eating it.  I'll out that this is thus far the only RC that I have done any other way than eating besides 5-meo-dmt and dpt.  I'm normally against it, but I read reports of others smoking it and something told me that it wouldn't hurt to try it.  I don't regret it, but eating works best for me.  I'm not condemning smoking it, just adding my personal observations.

I was somewhat irresponsible with it, I will admit. I wanted to try it before the "goo" stage, and I didn't have a scale, so I eyeballed it. It seemed to be about a 12-14mg dose, per effect. It worked out well, nice colorful visuals, no discernable body load, and so I tried smoking it. The change was negligible, but there was definitely a lot of smoke and a new feeling... the rush of 5-MeO-DMT was there, but it quickly faded.


I feel this compound would need extremely high smoked doses to achieve any strong effects.

I became very interested in this compound lately.  I recently tried Iprocin, and I loved it.  I am going to experiment with it a few more times, but I think my next chemical will likely be 4-AcO-MiPT unless I find a source of 4-HO/AcO-MET.  Anyhow, I've been hearing good things about this, but when I read the reports about it at TIHKAL, they seem totally different from what people are describing here.  I have always found that PIHKAL and TIHKAL are a good place to start researching a particular compound because there are alot of them there, but most of the experience reports don't do justice to the effects.  It is mostly because they are just short entries.  However, for those who have tried both, what is this chemical like compared to Iprocin/Iprocetyl (4-HO/AcO-DiPT)?  I have been straying away from chemicals that are TOO similar to eachother or that lack "content" as morninggloryseed and others have stated about 4-HO/AcO-DET.  Is it more on the side of MDMA with a psychedelic touch, or more psychedelic with an entactogenic touch like MDMA?  I also try to stick with the chemicals that have more prominant psychedelic effects.  I found Iprocin to be intense at 15mgs, but wanted to try 25mgs which I am doing tomorrow.  Iprocin was very intensely psychdelic, but had a very sensual nature to it.  I felt VERY connected to my girlfriend in both a "psychedelic" way, and in a sensual/emotional way similar to MDMA, but without the pushing.  It was more real.  Anyhow, I'm rambling..

I found 4-aco-dipt to be deep, but not forceful. I can pretty much 'function' on it, i.e. engage in normal every day cognitive tasks, if I have to. Still, its a wonderfully proufound experience just to surrender to 4-aco-dipt and flow with the trip. I've also noticed a definite body energy with 4-aco-dipt, one that is not too mucht trouble for me but some people don't react well to it. 4-aco-mipt I find to be cleaner, with little or no detectable body energy, and its also a bit of a more forceful psychedelic. While maybe not as forceful as say LSD or DPT, it still chips away at my ego when I am on it, and is confusing to engage in everyday tasks. 4-aco-mipt doesn't seem quite as 'entactogenic' as 4-aco-dipt either. I feel much more connected when I talk with my wife on 4-aco-dipt, and 4-aco-dipt is just wonderful for sex. But OTOH 4-aco-mipt at high doses could be somewhat suitable for entity contact. 4-aco-mipt I also find more visual than 4-aco-dipt. Duration of 4-aco-mipt is slightly longer.


As for 4-AcO-DET, I certainly wouldn't call it lacking in content or too similar to anything else. Its uniqueness though seems to be its dark side, which is amazingly sharp and clear but just dark. It seems a usefull tool for uncovering deep anxieties, but is hardly a fun or enjoyable substance.

Back on topic... I must stress that this is not a toy, this compound kicked my ass hardcore, especially when it came to sexuality issues. It showed me things that needed to be shown, but not gently like the phenethylamines, rather, it slapped me in the face. Hardcore stuff.


I do look forward to experimenting with it some more though, for sure!

I just wanted to bump this thread, and add a few things...


I have experimented with it twice now, once at 30mg and once at 58mg.  This is now my absolute favorite compound overall, out of all of the research chemicals - and I've tried 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, DPT, DIPT, DMT, 4-HO-DIPT, and 5-MeO-MIPT, just off the top of my head.  I like many compounds for many reasons, but OVERALL, this is definitely my favorite - it's got an incredibly ass-kicking mental component, which I love.  I've gotten absolutely no body load or bad side effects, even at 58mg.


Now I wouldn't have called it my favorite after my 30mg dose - but after my 58mg dose, there's absolutely no question.  I think it's very nice at moderate doses - but it's not until I took the dosage higher that I REALLY got the full effects, including the best mental/psychological ass-whooping I've gotten since my multiple dose acid trips I had years ago... 


The visuals are excellent too - I could just stare at my wall, and my entire field of vision would be nothing but patterns, moving, changing direction, flashing, just doing so many amazing things visually, you couldn't imagine... (which I didn't really get at lower doses)


Now of course anybody that is curious about trying this one - you should definitely start with lower doses, and move your way up SLOWLY (a lot slower than I did probably) if you like it and feel that more would be beneficial.  And I'm not saying that you'll have to take 60mg to get what I got - most likely, you won't.  I have a high tolerance to most psychadelics and usually have to take much higher doses than the average person to get the same effects.  All I'm saying is that, in my opinion, this is one compound that is definitely worth exploring, possibly at higher dosages, depending on how your body reacts to it at lower dosages.  My body reacted perfectly fine at lower doses, so I took it higher and was very glad I did. 


Anybody else tried this recently and have any comments?  Anyone found a single bad thing about it besides the price?  (and the fact that I could eat it like candy)


I'm just curious what others think of this one...

Well I "tasted" mine today, just about 8-9mg.  I just measured out another 12mg dose, and i'm leaving sitting in the capsule in the air right now, waiting for it to turn to goo! lol... It is stuck to the side at the moment..anyway..


I definitely liked this taste, I have (and still, haha) this smile on my face that just wont go away, 'the giggles' effect from mushrooms, which well, i like.  Seems real colorful, although i'm only in my room here and its hard to tell, colors are enhanced although I wouldn't say quite like mushrooms.  But, looking on the screen, letters, well, patterns around the letters are usually greenish/pinkish.  I do notice this "black and white" effect that I only got from mushrooms, for a short couple seconds looking at the screen.


Music definitley enhanced... I'd say even at the low dose I took this one is the one chem that comes close to mushrooms, in a lot of similarities, more than any of the others (including 4-aco/ho-det).  Which, ....I like hahaha.  I don't think any of these will do what a "4-aco/PO/ho-DMT" will do but the closer the better (for me).  This one ain't too far off, hopefully the 4-aco/ho-MET one will become available some day.  Either way they all do their own things.  This one hopefully will be a nice ass-kicker that i'll want to have around in my "toolbox" when I need it.


As for Iprocin, well that is one of my favorites too, to me that one is a one-with-your-body compound.  Instead of the one with the universe thing, it was like, instead of looking "UP", look "DOWN"! All the little workers inside your body..that need rest, food, living things.. Opens up a door from them to you (the big boss), but not in a super ass kicking way, or really just more gentle i guess.  Found what I want there thats all i'll say! (i'll write a full trip report, one of these days... procrastination.. the one trip being the most life-changing hehe).


Very nice, wierd color effects, ahh, why try to describe these things..  its nice though.  Higher dose next time definitely.

I can get some serious giggles on 4-aco-mipt. A couple of times I laughed so hard at something that I got completely dissociated for a moment.

Yeah it was quite a bit of "inappropriate" smiling and/or laughing.  Well, I wouldn't call it "inappropriate", lol.  Maybe to any of those, uh what do you call them, "NORMAL" people that might have come to the door or something, they might just think i'm laughing at them or something.  Now that I think about it... just on that dose, well the already laughing, well, i couldn't say I am NOT laughing AT them, because well, sometimes a lot more things than sober might seem pretty funny.  Especially a very normal neighbor coming by with a very silly question.  In fact I guess i'm still under the influence of my "taste" because, my whole post seems pretty pointless, and well, funny.  Haha! 8( 


I love the giggles.  Reminds me of Salvia, you watch someone new smoke some, and when they are back, say "Yeah, one of the um, side effects of smoking salvia is a lot of laughing" - if they aren't already laughing that should start it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I like 4-AcO-MIPT a LOT more than 4-HO-DIPT.  I have to take higher dosages of both, but 50mg of 4-AcO-MIPT makes me trip a whole lot harder than 50mg of 4-HO-DIPT.  Totally different trip too, I wouldn't say they're much alike at all.

Night and day.  4-HO-DIPT gave me no mental effects whatsoever, 4-AcO-MIPT was similiar to acid in mindstate - you could figure out the meaning of life, lots of things about yourself, etc. (or at least think you did)  Mindstate would totally be dependant on set and setting, just like it is with acid.  I like those kind of mental effects because they remind me so much of acid, and they're quite entertaining.  I didn't get any mental effects at all from 4-HO-DIPT.

So, 4-AcO-MiPT...


I really did latch on to a certain empathic quality in it. Very much akin to the chest glow of mdma, 5-MeO-DiPT, and AMT.  That certain speediness, combined with a heart chakra-like action. It seemed to really open me up to thinking about the love present in every moment, rather than focussing on the tape looped neurotrash usually cycled around inside my master control booth. I'm not sure if the feeling was just a random psychedelic retwisting back into shape of my mood, but I wonder if this one engenders a lighter mood than some of the other tryptamines I have tried, 4-AcO-DET especially, which feels very similar to me as what I experienced on 4-AcO-MiPT, but it seems much more of a cold, dark, wet and alien version of 4-AcO-MiPT. Who knows though. Maybe I was just in a good mood at the prospect of trying something new again after having many repeatable experiences over the past year or so. Who knows?

I have heard that 4-HO-MIPT has different/better (well opinions vary) effects and just acts different than the 4-Aco version.  I'd believe it as it seems like 4-HO-DIPT and 4-Aco-DIPT act differently.  The -DET's seem the same though?

Has anyone experienced any flushing of the face from 4-AcO-MiPT? My face has turned rather red on the last couple of low dose (5mg, 10mg) trials. I felt as if my temperature was raised, but I did not measure it. I felt sweaty though. Anyon else notice this? It hasn't happened to me from other chemz on any sort of predictable basis. That's why I am wondering about it...

That doesn't sound too far off from my experience last week.  During the first hour I felt like I was running fever, cold chills while sweating and so forth.  I have a similar reaction to mushrooms as well, so it didn't really bother me that much.  And after the first hour is let up and I felt great for the rest of the evening.

Well, I don't know if anyone else has ever done this - so I thought I'd post a little about my experience:


IM Injection of 48mg 4-AcO-MIPT


My usual dose with this chemical is 50 - 65mg, higher than most, so I would definitely NOT recommend anyone thinking of IM'ing this do as much as I did.  Probably starting with much LOWER than your regular dose would be a good idea.


But anyway, the 4-AcO-MIPT powder went into solution in distilled water very nicely, leaving me with a little over a milliliter of a transparent brown liquid, which I filtered through a micron filter and injected into my right leg.


Injection went fine, didn't burn or kill me or anything, and it started coming on in about 10 minutes.  Came on nice and smoothly, but much faster than when taken orally.  And the visuals were much more powerful with this method... I was amazed.


I can't really describe too much else about what the differences were between taking it orally and IM'ing it, but I will say that it seemed much more powerful IM'd, the experience was quite a bit different, and the visuals were EVEN better than a 60mg oral dose.


It was totally worth IM'ing it, and I will repeat this in the future.


There was quite a bit of soreness in my leg for a couple days after, but I get that with DPT as well so maybe I just need to find a way to use my glut...

Has anyone dissolved their 4-AcO-MiPT in alcohol and noticed a color change after about a week or so? I was storing the alcohol in a plastic container. The alcohol is now a dark, blackish-purple sorta color. My concern is that perhaps the alcohol pulled some crap out of the plastic container. Any idea what might have happened here?

Sorry, I have no answer to your question, but I've been really interested in this compound lately.  However, the hygroscopic properties seem like they are going to be a pain.

Somebody posted in the 4-HO-MiPT thread that the non-hygroscopic 4-AcO-MiPT produced very severe tremors, has anyone else noticed it with this particular batch of the compound?  I have the non-hygroscopic stuff, but haven't gotten around to trying it yet.

Just a note to all you people who got the "non-hygroscopic" batch... I did too... its only non-hygroscopic for so long... then it will really goo on you... just store it well.


But no, I never had any sort of "tremor" from 4-AcO-MiPT. The worst side effect I ever had... was when I combined it with 6 shots of Brandy (was already drunk, took the pill).... I was nauseaous the entire night, exhausted but couldn't sleep, hallucinating bad, eye wiggles, everything...


But I've never had any real negative side effects from this compound... *shrugs* I get negative effects with everything... but not this one.

I'd just like to put the fact out there, that everytime I have experienced 4-AcO-MiPT, I have invariably experienced a noticable flushing of my face, as well as a sensation of "overheating," which I have not experienced as consistently with any other R.C. Just FYI for all those who are going to be combining this chem with others, or perhaps dancing or some other exertive type activity while on 4-AcO-MiPT.

Indeed - although I personally have never experienced side effects like that, even when I IM it (IM is the only way I do this chemical anymore).  


But as differently as people can react to the same chemical, it's definitely a good idea to put out that information.

Hi All,


I'm kind of wondering about the 'tremor' that folks are stating they have with the new, non-hygroscopic batch of the 4-AcO. This just doesn't seem right to me. I've taken the hygroscopic stuff up to 40mg and never had any really noticable tremors. I also received a sample of the non-hygroscopic 4-AcO batch but haven't had a chance to taste it yet. I'm interested in trying the new batch to see if I get any noticable tremors from it. If so, there has got to be something different between the two batches that is causing the tremor. Has anybody here tried both the hygroscopic and non-hygroscopic batches of the 4-AcO and can make a comparison for us? Does the newer stuff cause tremors when the hygroscopic batch didn't? Is the newer batch more potent?


Like I said, I've never had tremors on the non-hygroscopic stuff. I got a sample of the new stuff, but I'm not sure when I'm going to get around to tasting it. I currently am focusing my time on some research with 4-OH-MiPT instead. I'm just figuring if once I try the new batch, if it causes me to tremor when the old stuff didn't, something is not good here? Perhaps a by product during synthesis or somthing is in the product as well? I'm just wondering if somebody here has had a chance to sample both batches and can compare for us.


If nobody replies and I sample the newer batch soon, I will post my findings. Although my usual 4-AcO dose is around 40mg, I will be dropping it to probably 24mg or so for my first taste of the new batch just to be sure.

Has anyone here attempted any kind of long-term storage (3 months or more?) of either 4-AcO-MIPT or 4-HO-MIPT in solution?  If so, Is there any sign of degradation?  


Basic intuition would suggest that these chems would be particularly susceptible to degradation like 4-HO-DIPT, 4-ACO-DIPT, 4-HO-DET, and 4-ACO-DET supposedly are.  On the other hand, storage in liquid may be helpful to allow accurate measurement before the stuff turns to goo.  


With all this in mind, I do know that I have a 4-ACO-DIPT sample that I acquired about a year ago which has been stored as a dry powder in a gel-capsule at room temperature in the absence of light for about a year now.  Last I checked, it showed no visible signs of degradation.  It hasn't been checked for activity yet, so who knows.  It certainly hasn't decomposed into black-goo yet like I expected it to.

Ya I read that but Im somewhat put off by the reports of its challenging psychedelic nature. It seems as though if you are that lost that the sensual an erotic can be lost in the mindspace of such a heavy tryp. Anyones thoughts on that?

I would have to disagree with that. I got lost in a completely sexual world both times I took more than 18mg. A good hour and a half each time, I'd say.


The only thing that puts me off is that duration is not set in stone. I had one trip last 9 hours and another, only 3....

4-AcO-MIPT in a vial the freezer for six months, no loss in potency. The material did turn in a light amberish epoxy as soon as a got it and stay that way, but no loss in potency. I also has some in a gel cap at room temperature (but protected from light) for about a month with no loss in potency.


4-HO-MIPT i really don't know yet.

I've had 4-ACO-DIPT, 4-ACO-DET in the freezer for a year and a half with no loss in potency. I've also had them both sitting in a gel cap for a month or longer with no loss in potency just some slight discoloration. I never had any 4-ACO-DET turn into black goo. I believe it was the freebase that did that and mine is an HCl salt.


4-HO-DIPT sitting in a gel cap for a month seems to lose potency.

**Overview**


I thought I write something more about on this little less known substance, named miprocin.


I must say it is my first 4-pos tryptamine and second tryptamine in all. First was DPT, which is best nonoral substance. So, I can't compare it to other 4-pos tryptamines and mushrooms.


I ingested 10-12mg(there was around 1-2mg on knife) miprocin at 21:35PM. Within 20min, I was already feeling first effects building and fast. With another 15min, I was approaching to +2. Fast acting tryptamines are new to me and I was off guard. It felt like it hits you like DPT.


Colors were brighter and texture had more depth. Mental component was different than I have used to get. I have used more phens and this tryptamine took me to new mental space. Only thing that I would like to note about it now, is that I felt like I was aware of higher ME. I was consulting with myself and there was feeling that "I" don't need to think and that higher ME is doing it for me. Don't ask me how or how it felt, but that how I can describe it.


I got to strong +2 and maybe one point was in week week +3. The time at +3 felt at one point  frightening. This isn't good word for it, but it got so intense, that it did felt it could get threatening to my ego if you can say so.


Second time, I got predominant color with different substance. This substance seems to have blue or ocean-blue or aquarius blue color. I got it in every room and on different things. Objects had thin layer of blue on top of them. There was also neon green color that blended to to blue almost instantly. The other substance with predominant color is 2C-T-2, that has orange-ish red color


One thing that I really like about in this substance, was music enhancement. Music wasn't distorted or anything, but it just sounded great. It wasn't normal psychedelic music enhancment, it is unique to this substance. I had trouble choosing good music at trip time, but every song that I listened, sounded just great.


One new and disturbing thing was that I had little diarrhoea at one point. If I hadn't make it to bathroom, I would have to definitely shit my pants. This was maybe 10-15min stage in experience. I hope this was due too something else and isn't constant.


Other weird effect was that I got very hot. I was little bit dehydrated as well. I took off mu t-shirt at that helped alot, but still, I was hotter than on any other substance... maybe on MDMA I have also been that hot.


This is one new chemical that I love. It is visual, nice mental space and deep. Not deep like 2C-E, but it touches different parts of brain and is deep in other sense. I went to sleep 02:38AM. I still felt it, but I think it would have been over with another hour. I woke up after 6h and felt refreshed and energetic. Hope someone will find this information useful. I will write full report at least about one of my upcoming experimentation with this chemical.


One interesting thought I got trip time, was that I would like to mix it with MDMA. I felt like it would mix nice and give  interesting synergy. I sure try this combination and let you know how it works out.

Psilocin is quite unstable as the free base, especially if there is some inorganic base present. So the purity can call the stability shots as well." This likely applies to ethocin and 4-HO-DIPT (iprocin) free bases as well. If you have any of these 4-substituted tryptamines in free base form, you should take extra care to keep it in optimal conditions - air tight, dry, and very cold. Perhaps store with an oxygen absorbant pack and silica gel dessicant if possible.

Wow, finally got around to trying this stuff. I'm not really in the mood to write up a detailed story right now but I must say it is beautiful.


Blue and green are the dominant colors. Visuals are like a cross between mushrooms and acid. Flow like shrooms, electric like acid.


The body feel is amazing. Amazing in the sense that I had absolutely no body load or jitters. The comeup was quick but smooth and quickly settled into a comfortable and trippy plateau for the next 3 hours before slowly dropping off.


My friend who also dosed (we each took 14mg) jammed with me on guitar and I can really say we have never been that in tune with each other musically. This stuff is on par with LSD in terms of musical enhancement. Perhaps the perfect concert drug!


Sense of humor was heightened, and interaction with others was relatively easy. At 14mg I reached a high ++.


7 hours later I decided to redose with 16mg, really because some other people were dosing and I wanted to see if it worked again. Apparently I built absolutely no tolerance because I tripped harder the second time (low/medium +++). Again, it was beautiful, anxiety free, colorful, WOW.


About 6-7 hours after dosing I could sleep.


This stuff is second only to high quality LSD in my book. Highly recreational, potentially deep, beautiful visually, and soooo easy on the body.


My next dose will be 18-20mg, although I'm sure I could go higher.


....


I would pretty much never eat mushrooms if I had 4-aco-mipt available. It lacks the qualities of shrooms that I tend to dislike, yet seems to incorporate some of the aspects of LSD that I have come to love.

By the way my material is almost completely white, does not appear to be hydroscopic or change color when exposed to air, and is mostly powder with some small dense chunks.

This is one I really regret not getting more of.  I only took a small dose but really enjoyed it...much more so than 4-Ho-MiPT.

What would be the full chemical name for 4-aco-mipt ?


Please give the two different chemical name for the compound (two different names: the "tryptamine ending name" and the "indol or indolol ending name")


for instance:

5-MeO-DMT  is...

5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine 

OR  5-methoxy-3-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]indole  


Do all common tryptamines have a 4-ACo analogues ?

(I mean 4-aco   dmt, dpt, aet, dbt, eipt, dipt, mipt, net, nmt ?)


Same for 4-HO and 5-MeO analogues?

**4-aco-mipt solubility**


Has anyone else had problems recently dissolving their 4-aco-mipt in water?  Mine dissolves fine in alcohol and it has a light tan color, but I'm wondering why past posts have mentioned water solubility while mine is completely insoluble.  Maybe it's the new non-hygroscopic batch that has different properties but why? Could it be something to do with the crystalization process or an added chemical?  It also seems to be fairly resistant to any oxidation so far (a small sample was left out at room temp for a few weeks) and shows no signs of turning to goo.  Thanks for any help.

I'm not sure what you really mean, but in theory any 4-hydroxylated tryptamine can/does have a corresponding acetate ester.


The full 'chemical' name for 4-AcO-MiPT is 4-acetyloxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, or 3-{2-[isopropyl(methyl)amino]ethyl}-1H-indol-4-yl acetate.

Hmm I must admit im having a strange time with the stuff. took 40 mg 2:30 ago. Almost fell asleep on the stuff. now it is like the world is simply a blur. Lots of very subtle color undertones and superb music enhancement (currently listening to OhGr).

This stuff continues to be elusive for me even at high end doses I do not get the effects other people have reported. I like it though. There is definitely something there that entices me. 


What is the highest anyone here has taken of this stuff? as far as I know im pushing 5mg over the recommended dosage range currently.

40mg of 4-aco-MiPT would have most people begging for mercy. 


Do you have a psychedelic tolerance? I would imagine 40mg, for me, would be about as intense as 7-8 grams of mushrooms.... a little more than "subtle undertones"!

it doesnt seem to disolve in water. 

To experiement i dropped ~5mg into a shot glass with water. Nothing happened. After a few days the water had become dark drown and te 5mg was not active. (i have never tried 5mg though so perhaps it was just too low of a dose)

well bluedolphin I think its obvious I do have a tolerance. Maybe insufflation is the way to go for this stuff for me. If you cant tell by my trip report with DOC I can take insanely high doses and still come out in almost complete control.


Still a bit altered this morning from it but I managed to go to sleep at about the 5:30 mark with a little trouble. I think it was just because I was tired to begin with. That might have played a big role in it.

I found insufflation of 4-aco-MiPT to give more side effects such as difficulty telling if you're hot or cold, tremors, and other undesireable elements of a typical "tryptamine body load".


I'd wait for your tolerance to go down and try 26mg, and expect a strong +++. If that doesn't at least give you a stronger trip than your last 40mg trip, I'd question how good your batch of 4-aco-MiPT is.

Some folks just are ‘hardheads’ to some extent.  One knows of reliable reports of persons who prefer to dose in mid 40’s to mid 50’s with 4-AcO-MIPT.  They reportedly have compounds that were lab analyzed and do not trip every weekend or anything like that.  


One know of at least one case where an individual who was reportedly on no Rx medications, only dosed about 1X monthly or less, had known accurate material, took 26 mg. and got minimal effects (they said about equivalent to “1 hit” of street acid)… BUT here is the interesting piece… the effects, while mild, lasted a very long time for them.  They have reported a similar effect with 4-HO-MIPT & 4-HO-DIPT as well.  Namely that it was closer to 1.5 to 2.5X the duration most persons report but milder in level of intensity…  People’s rate of absorption, metabolism, body chemistry, etc. can and do really vary.


One found this interesting.

I've read this entire thread, but I'm still a bit unclear on something:


If this is dissolved in everclear, how long will it store at room temperature?


Will water/80-proof alcohol work, or does it need to be something like everclear?


Is it absolutely necessary that this get stored in the freezer?


Like, if I obtained 500 mg of this and dissolved it in solution, and kept it in my closet in an airtight container, how long could I expect it to keep for?

If this is dissolved in everclear, how long will it store at room temperature?


- If it's about 4-HO-Mipt, it will turn into something nasty pretty quickly (However, it seem to be just as potent)...the 4-ACO is more stable but I've not exp. with this compound.


Will water/80-proof alcohol work, or does it need to be something like everclear?


- 37°-40° seem the min. to me.


Is it absolutely necessary that this get stored in the freezer?


- Yes, If you prefer not test something that had turned black.


Like, if I obtained 500 mg of this and dissolved it in solution, and kept it in my closet in an airtight container, how long could I expect it to keep for?


- I have my miprocine (4-Ho) in my freezer in 90° solution since 10 month, no potency loss noticed. It's slightly greener each month...

Okay, thanks.


So if I dissolve 500 mg in solution and store it in the freezer, it would freeze, correct? And then I'd have to thaw it every time I want to dose, or what?


Perhaps I'd be better off doing what glog said and measuring out individual doses all at once and then freezing them. Not sure if I could really do that, though...


I'm looking to keep it out of my freezer if possible, since I'm not the only one with access to it, but I guess freezing it is basically mandatory?


I might be able to figure out a way to keep it in there...


EDIT: also, I'm talking about the 4-aco. you say the 4-ho turns into something nasty, but is still potent? Would that be the case with the 4-aco as well? Because I don't mind working with a nasty material, so long as it gets the job done and isn't harmful in any way.


I realize a lot of this is purely speculation at this point, but I'm interested in people's experiences with this.

the 4-aco compound can lose its acetyl through transesterification in alcohol (or water as well),the time it takes though is unknown.You will end up with 4-ho-mipt.

I dissolved some 4-aco-mipt in a 100% etOH solution and found that it turned black within a week.  The dry powder was stored in a freezer and shows no signs of degradation.  I think I read somewhere that at least one person has taken the black substance and reported similar activity, but I wouldn't even think about ingesting that stuff.  There was some speculation that the color was either due to a high molecular weight polymer, or a breakdown product that may or may not be active itself (not the transesterfication product 4-ho-mipt because that isn't colored)


As far as freezing everclear, good luck.  For a 95% etOH solution, it should freeze below -110 deg F or -80 deg C.  Got some liquid nitrogen on hand?8) 


Keep your powder dry until you need to dissolve it, but don't store it in everclear unless you want to drink black goo.

Unless the black goo is somehow harmful, or inactive, I really don't mind drinking it...


I'd be interested of hearing any reports of people who've ingested said "black goo", and exactly what happened.


I know the best idea is to keep it as powder until I use it, but I don't have a scale (yes, I know, I should get one...).

maybe your batch has degraded.

38mg sounds like a high dose.

I've gone up to 27mg on this and also havent had much of an effect. I was definately tripping, and I would get visuals if I stared at something long enough. Flat paintings would almost become 3d after looking at them for a while and patterned surfaces like wood or marble seemed to move a little bit.


I don't smoke or take any other drugs or medications, and I hadn't had anything recently that would have created a tolerance.


This stuff is nice, but very very subtle and definately not overwhelming in the slightest.

Wow, really strange, I've got a full +++ at 24mg to a point that the visuals were no more important (but I was seeing faces, everything was moving, etc.).


To me, it seem like you had a bad batch. 27mg must be a full trip for the vast majority.

Hmm , I've taken 50mg and had a good time, I've taken 35mg and been propelled into the stratosphere, from the sqame batch I may add.

  The feeling I got from the 35mg was that the drug had "docked " perfectly in my brain , like everything was "just so" for the drug to express itself completely fully.

  It can be a bit of a surprise at times.

I dont think its degraded, at the time of the 38mg dose id only had it for maybe 3 weeks. Out of three people who have dosed from the same batch, one also thought 38mg didnt produce the effects that were expected, but two others who had 25mg were at a definate +++, full on visuals etc. 4-aco-mipt definatly intrigues me, I think once i find the right dose for me it will have a lot to offer

just like every other compound, i need a high dose (~30-50mgs). everything gets sparkley, i tried to do the dishes and was scared of by the silverware sparkling at me like diamonds. everything had a greenish hue. i was happy, laughing at things. TV showed itself for what it is - a sucker of energy and ideas... had an awesome time


i was shaking on the come up and sweating from the walk i was on, but getting home everything was great. I came to terms with me about to become a father. sorted my head out and am now more positive about it than ever before :D i cant begin to explain just how much good this chemical did for my thoughts on this subject. i feel reborn


and the most unusual, towards the end, whenever i would look at a fractal, it would turn into a fractal animation, but nothing else would be moving. not the walls carpet or even the bathroom (that always moves when oine is tripping) but these fractals... whoa! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


i've noticed that im not feeling in the slightest sad or down at all either.

I also found that 4-aco-mipt did a great deal of good in terms of understanding things from an emotional point of view. I had been having problems with my long term partner and this chem helped me take a whole new viewpoint on the situation, which was exactly what i needed.

Hey, everyone seems to say the body high on this material is very nice, very euphoric.  Im wondering how well this body high stears the direction of the mental aspects of the trip.  I was thinking how mdma generally leads itself to thinking in a positive light because the body feels so good, and on other psychs if the body feels good the thoughts tend to go in positive directions more easily.  


So would people say that the body high tends to push the trip into a positive direction?  


This seems to be worded kinda vauge but I think people might know what im sayin...

In my opinion, there is nothing MDMA like about 4-AcO-MiPT, or anything particularly 'euphoric' about it....on the other hand I found it to be a great psychedelic, that felt really good, and at the time (only took it once, and Im sure set and setting played their role as always) that made me very happy.

Well i wasnt implying it felt like mdma. 

 I was just wondering if the body high that people speak of accosiated with this material lends it self to a positive experience.  Like as it comes on does one feel  'damn my body feels pretty nice, i feel strong, my legs feel good, blah blah blah'  and then thoughts spin off from those thoughts about other things.  rather than 'oh man i feel wicked cold and like im gonna puke and like im thirsty but it couldnt be quenched'  and thoughts spinning off from that like omg what have i done to myself blah blah blah.

For me, the amazing body high of this compound and also 4-HO-MIPT definitely added a positive influence to the experience. I usually spend most of the time on it masturbating and wouldn't even have time for it to go bad. 

Then again, the feeling might be entirely negative on a bad trip. After all, it's a psychedelic, right?

**4-ACO-MiPT Dosage**


Yes, I've UTFSE.  Yes, I've searched Erowid and the B&Ds.


There's very little information on dosage, as far as I've seen.  What I've read is all over the map.


I'm not especially tolerant or intolerant to psychs, from what little experience I've had (LSD once, 2C-I thrice, Salvia once).  At 5'6" and 200lbs, I'm thinking that for a first-time dose 12mgs sounds about right.  I don't want anything too intense, but I want a feel for what it's capable of.


Your insights would be most useful.

From what I researched, dosage seems to be in the 12-30mg range. I took 14mg + 16 mg several hours laters a couple of weeks ago and it produced very mild effects, but then again I have a natural strong tolerance to psychedelics.

And to answer your question, 12mg would be a fine starting dosage.

There is a 10 page thread on this drug.  ANd there is dosing information.  How can you have used the search engine, and not seen it?


Either way, I had powerful effects at 8mg.  THis is said to be slightly less potent than miprocin, so I'd say (based on what 8mg was like) that 20mg would be as high as I would go.

Since you have not had mushrooms before, 12 mg is a good starting dose.  If you had, I would say that an eighth is equivalent to about 18 mg.  The problem with this comparison is that an eighth can have varying amounts of psilocin and psilocybin.  Anyway, starting low is a good idea.  Enjoy.

Actually it seems to have a quite low dose-response curve. I might also attribute this to tolerance, but 15, 17 and 23mg didn't feel very different from each other. In fact the novelty seemed to wear off after an hour on the higher doses. It seemed to come up and peak within an hour.

At 23.5 mgs , 4aco-mipt, was a very very, shal I say, Very strong psychedelic.  I agree with MGS, I would not want to go too much higher than  20mgs.  judging by the sheer intensity of me and my fiance's trip, I would say that maybe I got the 4ho-mipt, except mine was the tan color. Also, This is def. the best exotic Tryptamine Ive tried. All the wonderful mind effects of Acid...(synaesthsia, very LSD like thought patterns) with the duration of Mushrooms. 

I actually would take this over Acid any day of the week!

I should specify....8mg didn't give me a "strong experience' (as in a full-fledged +3), but rather for having eaten such a tiny amount, I had powerful effects (considering the dosage) probably equal to a gram of 'average mushrooms' in potency.

**Well shit...**


So...in preparation for tonight's festivities, I measured my supply, and found it to be 98mgs.  My intent was to put 15mg doses into gelcaps.  However, I discovered that my newly-obtained mg scale was not sensitive enough to do so accurately.


On to plan B...I dissolved the ~100mgs in 200ml of distilled water.  The chemical, however, is not dissolving, but settling in the bottom of the jar.  Am I now totally hosed, or what?


Help, please.  From the Big & Dandy, it sounded as though 4-ACO-Mipt was water-soluable...

Bear in mind that there is a difference between 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT HCl.

Lemme guess...HCl isn't soluable.![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif) 


So what do I do now?  I know "take your best shot" is a pretty bad idea, and I'm guessing there's no good way to recover it.  Am I just out the money, with a lesson learned?  Say it ain't so...

Actually the HCl should dissolve the best (it is a salt form).  Ascorbic acid might improve things if it is in the freebase or some small warming might encourage a compound to go into solution.

All I know for sure is that it's HCl.  I have no information regarding freebase, and frankly, just don't know a whole lot about chemistry in general.


whatsupdoc's post has me confused...are there two different salts?


The stuff was a light brown powder, just a bit lighter than "light" brown sugar...sort of a khaki color.

From what I have read (never attempted myself) the hcl of this compound is not very water soluble.  Perhaps try gently heating the solution.  Another thing would be to add a few drops of HCL.  You can get that at a hardware store.  Be careful using heat...this compound is probably not the most stable.

For future reference, 10ml of white vinegar in 200ml of distilled water seems to do the trick.  Thanks, all.  I'll let you know how tonight goes.


-----------------------------------------------------


Well, I ended up taking something closer to 25mgs (15mgs initially, 5mgs an hour later, and another 5mgs 60-90 minutes after that) since I had eaten shortly before trying this, and it was taking more to feel any effects.


Other than the sweating as I came up, this was extremely gentle and blissful.  While there were no visuals to speak of, I found myself in a very relaxed and dreamy state of mind.  It felt like I was able to direct where it went, switching at will from a body sensation to a more internal one.  There was nothing pushy about this at all...quite malleable.  It also facilitated one of the most absorbing and consuming sexual experiences I've ever had...just totally losing myself in the pure energy of the moment.


The high itself was really no more than ++, but I would do this again without hesitation.

It is possible. There's a list with boiling points of various tryptamines on the lycaeum. I don't have the link though. :D Maybe someone can help out.


I think you'll be fine with snorting or eating though, it will kick in fairly fast. The acetoxylated compounds kick in faster than the hydroxylated ones if I'm not mistaken and the comeup is quiet intense already. I don't have evidence to prove this right now, but I've read a text by someone who was discussing the why of this phenomenom on a neurochemical level.


I've heard a couple of people say intrapulmonally admistered 4-HO-DMT was far more intense than DMT taken via the same route, so watch out and start with a low dose, definitely not more than 5mg. I find 4-AcO-MiPT kinda disappointing in higher doses anyway, it gets really intense up to a certain level (~25mg) and above that you just get more bodyload basically.

I was justmore curious about it rather than actually thinking about it.  The come up is very fast and very intense as well. Definately deserves mounds of respect

What about it exactly?


Im also a fan. But personally i like LSD 2c-e and miprocin more.


Maybe i just need to take the dose up a bit. So far my 2 experiences with mipracetyl have been good but nothing special.

i like how clean and sharp it is, and it seems more recreational as miprocin (4-ho-mipt) is deeper.  it did have a rough ride up though, i thought it would be a lot more intense than it was just because of the anxiety for the first 20 or so minutes.  after that it was very warm and just overall nice, not strong at all, nothing like a 5-methoxy.  definately one of my favorites.

at 23mg I found it to be  more intense than my heaviest acid trip of four hits of some stronger paper. The Synaestheisa was awesome. This one is definately up there with 2C-E and LSD for me. I havent however, tried the Hydroxyl yet.

ya, when i took 33mg (fumarate, so about 25mg) i had for a second a visual that i saw on DPT once.  it was like a big medallion or something.  it seemed like it was real stable in water too, whereas when i put miprocin (4-ho-mipt) in water, it almost instantly turned green and eventually lost almost all its potency.  the 4-ho version is so much deeper, and has those coincidences that i like, you know, those shroom coincidences that are too crazy to just be a coincidence.

the body load was fine, more of a buzz (pretty much none, just warmth really).  i felt great, it was just the come up that was kind of weird.  it seemed like i was in for a real ride but after the first 15 minutes it was mellow as hell.

Yeah same here. First 15 minutes I'm just trying to hold onto something real it's so intense, after that I try to squeeze the last bid of psychedelia out of the experience. It is very very erotic for me btw! You should try to climax on the peak of the trip! Have some good music on as well and try to make the music climax simultaneously with you and the trip. It's definitely good stuff.

**4 aco Mipt**


One of the best RCs IMHO but as previously mentioned high dodes produce bodyload (well we found more it was quite severe neck tension (at 40 mgs)

     It can be quite visual but only say one in five times (a guess) the rest is just a sort of psychedelic feeling nearer acid than mushies but not really either ! stick to 25mgs or a tad less i would say !

I find that a lot of the 4-AcO-Ts are like this -- Not terrible visual until huge doses, and by then you have a reasonable body load and a whole lot of mindfuck.  They can be a little more recreational/euphoric than 4-HO-Ts, but on the whole I'm not that fond of them.

A friend of mine did it last night.


He said it was the hardest he'd ever tripped in his life, and he does plenty of psychedelics (mixes K too). Mentioned "swirling" and he had to look really close to his computer screen to even see it properly.

Just curious if there was any new opinions on the solubility of this one, and its stability in solution.


I'm probably going to be dosing in a few days and I haven't yet put it in solution--it seems that there's reports all over the map about it's stability but some people might have messed things up a bit by using impure water I suppose.


I was thinking of some sort of 100proof vodka/deionized water solution, but if at all possible I'd much rather just use pure D.I. water. Anyone? ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

I just wanted to say that I gave this one a low-dose test run last night and I almost want to keep it for that purpose. (maybe not, but it was pretty cool)


I imagine it was about 12mg (fumerate salt). It gave me a really nice tingly/electric body high, a mild euphoria, and just a general positive vibe that was perfect for what I did (curling up under a blanket and watching American Beauty). 


There was a little bit of associative thinking at that dose, but nothing major. Some minor visuals (light flashes and objects breathing). 


Fell soundly asleep after the movie was over (about 3 hours after dosing).

That about sums up my experience as well.  I liked the spatula after transfering mine to a vial.  That was the only time I have ever eyeballed a substance like this...I suspect I ate no more than 8mg or so.  This was with that first batch that turned to goo upon exposure to air.  I cannot remember if it was the base or the salt...I threw away the COA long ago.

*[don't incriminate yourself]*  I want to try out a couple different routes of administration.


Does snorting/vaporizing/IM administration work? And if there are no personal experiences could someone with more experience and knowledge of chemistry and drugs explain the dangers (if there are any) of trying a new route with a new chemical. I'm open to experimenting, I just want to know if it's a good idea or not.


I have yet to try this chem out, but my friends say it's amazing.

It is best taken oraly. I tried freebasing 4-ho-mipt converted to the freebase with no real effect. 

Snorting it works, but the drip is terrible and it is just not worth it.  I personally had a very bad reaction to insnufflated 4-aco-dipt. 

Tread these waters with caution.

I tried it!


I took 15 mg, measured with a syringe off of a 10 mg scale...not the best method, but the mg scale is coming in the mail soon.


It did remind me of shrooms a lot. The come-up was amazingly fast and nausea free, the first psychedelic I've tried that didn't have a body load at all. My past psychedelic experience includes shrooms, 2c-i, 2c-e, 5-meo-dmt, salvia and DXM. My only bit of nausea was fleeting and cured by a loud and healthy belch.


 Visuals were cool, a lot like shrooms, except I got noticeably more CEV and slightly less OEV. During the come-up, all the cars that would drive by in the distance would look exactly like toy cars. My sense of perspective was completely fucked. Me and my friends spent the first half an hour coming up just walking around dizzily feeling fucked up. Patterning was amazing, especially when I was on the ice. We walked on a ice rink next to a school but it felt like we were walking on a lake...cool shit.


Intensity of 15 mg seemed to be about a half-eighth of shrooms, but these things are hard to gauge based on the variability of tripping. One of my friends took 10 mg and was definitely tripping less than me, although he's usually very sensitive (at least to phenethylamines)


My trip wasn't amazing though; I didn't feel like I got much out of it. The whole time I felt like coming down, and I had terrible circular thinking. These things are more due to my set, but I couldn't help but be extremely paranoid about all my friends around me. Everything they said seem to carry extra meaning. Their words were a plot. When my friend talked about the sunset I could see the hidden motive in his words and would start to plan my words accordingly...it was all in my head.


I never found shrooms to be a very helpful psychedelic either, it's hard to process your thoughts when you keep forgetting everything every 3 seconds. I much preferred 2c-e. Endless hours of stimulated insanity coupled with realizations bubbling up from my inner consciousness seems to be more to my taste.


In terms of length, I was expecting a 4 hour trip. I took around 4 and at about 8:30 I considered myself mostly down, but still going just a little. Then I smoked three bowls and that completely changed. On other psychedelics, if I smoke weed after the come-down it just makes me really high and brings back a couple aspects of the trip, but this time, I was tripping, just as hard as my peak. It was almost as if the trip completely started over again. I still live with my parents and they are opposed to such experimenting, so coming home was difficult for me. 


Sleep didn't come until 1 in the morning, even after the weed.


P.S. (to nife): I'm still a greenlighter (15 posts) and cannot send PM.

so ~25mg of the fumarate would calculate to how many mg of the HCl?


didn't realize the fumarate's molecular weight was so much greater.

Just going to report my second, much more positive experience with this compound.


I was in my house in the middle of the night weighing stuff out, when I decided to dose myself. My friend had taken some earlier and said that it was extremely weak and must have degraded or something. It turns out, he was lying and didn't actually take the drug for whatever reason, which I found out from him the next day. This influenced my decision to take a large dose. I took a 15 mg pill, and then 10 minutes later I just ate what was at least 20 mg, but I wasn't really sure. I wanted to trip, and just ate an eyeballed amount.


It was kinda stupid, but the result was amazing. As my entire world melted around me and I was shaking in fear, I slowly started to become more and more comfortable with myself and overcame my fear of intense psychedelic experiences. The rest of the night I was flying in my own bliss, listening to angels singing and love pouring into me.


I would just like to recommend that people try large doses, Terrence McKenna did say once that no mushroom trip should be under 4 grams, and I think I agree... I feel completely reborn.  %)

I have been guilty of this rash re-dosing with 4-AcO-MIPT as well. And Xorkoth has just written a report where he describes dosing 4-AcO-DMT multiple times...   my first dose was also carefully measured, and my second and third (the top-ups) were eyeballed... I do have a feeling that these chems are fairly forgiving even if one goes up to, say, 50mg. Well, at least in terms of actual physical harm done. In fact, it seems to be next to none in terms of actual toxicity.


For the record, this is just a hunch I have for a number of 4-substituted tryptamines. It may not be true for all of the 4-substituted tryptamines, and it may not even be true at all - it has just been my experience that they seem to invite redosing more than other chems, and that they're more benign as well (compared to, say 5-MeO-MIPT and 5-MeO-DIPT, and the 2C-T's and the 2C's). 


Everyone please proceed with caution, and know how much you're ingesting. Only redose if it feels right to you.

/\ I was given it by a good heart who asked me to report back to him on how smoking goes as he doesn't smoke. I may have smoked a few mg's but it didn't really do what I had expected (did I make it too hot and destroy the molecule?), and I ended up eating it, later on snorting a little off my finger. On another (earlier) occasion I plugged a fairly big amount (approx. 20mg, I don't remember, around what would be a strong oral dose for many) ... kinda getting permeated by the molecule through every orifice... only had 100mg, and they all went in 2 sessions... one alone, and one in company (where the other person did about 15mg). So I basically caned at least 80mg of this stuff in 2 sessions. Hard to find a more morish molecule. The fumarate I have didn't quite feel so morish - but then i haven't touched that one for a while, and set/setting may have had to do with the perceived morishness of the molecule, I'm not sure (call me an unreliable narrator...).

So, the 4-aco-mipt (i always just say mipt, being the only mipt I have dealings with) that I have been using is now a questionable substance.


My friend was in a large possession of the chem and was arrested for an unrelated crime. They found the pills and claimed they were heroin. A week later when she was let off (yesterday), the police told her they sent it in for testing and found it showed up as "mostly heroin".


This makes absolutely no sense to me, because it felt sooo much like shrooms, and I'm very skeptical when I'm taking chemicals, especially one's I haven't tried before. I for one do not believe that it's heroin, except possible in a small enough amount to not matter, why would my supplier (a generally considered great vendor, I'm sure most of you would agree if I was allowed to post sources) lace my product with heroin?


Anyways, to my question. How would I go about testing? I'm looking for people with experience and knowledge of both H and psychedelics who could tell me some obvious things to look for. I was thinking, since H's oral dose is much higher than the mipt's dose, We would try smoking it. My idea was to have a volunteer smoke 10 mg, depending on the strength, smoke another dose an hour later, then another dose an hour later, and so on, until the tolerance of the mipt prevents the test subject from tripping, but they could still feel the heroin?


Can I get a marquis-reagent test or something? Test melting points? Any ideas?

I have a feeling that's bullshit and the police are trying to get your friend for drug possession.  They probably had it tested, didn't know what it was, saw that it wasn't illegal, and thought it would be easier to claim it was a schedule 1 substance.


Just my feeling about it, though.  As you said, why the hell would a vendor of legal substances (quasi-legal) lace a product with heroin?  Especially since heroin is worth more on the street by far?

4-AcO-MIPT is on some level as pleasant as heroin, I find. But it's clearly a very different drug - at least the batches of it I have tried (the fumarate and the free base).


I've tried it about 5 times now over the last year... orally and and nasally and plugged - albeit always in a peaceful state of mind to start with - at dosages ranging from a meagre 9mg (which was my first time) to a whopping 50mg (some of it plugged) ... my favourite tryptamine by far at the moment because it is so pleasurable. But it's not heroin.... heroin doesn't give me OEV's and makes me want to close my eyes and curl up and it makes me itch...  and obviously it lacks truly psychedelic insight (imho). Though it seems to me 4-AcO-MIPT may have a tranquilising effect to it... I feel a bit floored (pleasantly), am unable to reach orgasm, and there is simply no fear response at all.


Until I try 4-AcO-DMT again, for so many positive comments have been made about that one, this shall remain my favourite tryptamine. More abuse potential than most others, though, as it doesn't seem to go quite as deep as some. In an indoor setting (because the body gets a bit heavy, in a pleasant way) this is easier to handle than some 2C's even. And so nice.... consistently, in my case.


***Have there been any studies done on 4-AcO-MIPT and its mechanism of action ?***


 The way it leaves me calm and collected (as opposed to some psychedelics that leave me scattered and a little tense) is truly special. Of all those I have tried, only MDMA or MDA can do that, or perhaps 4-AcO-DMT (which also felt peaceful when I tried it, although I haven't explored it properly yet).

I cant wait to try this one out as I have a confirmed batch. I once had a very remarkable trip on what was supposedly 5-MeO-MiPT and had no nausea, very quick comeup, very intense visuals, and very deep cosmic thoughts, but now I may suspect it may have been 4-AcO-MiPT.

what you describe sounds like it may well have been 4-AcO-MiPT cos it surely doesn't sound anything like 5-MeO-MiPT. 5-MeO-MiPT feels really uncomfortable and alien to me, whereas the 4-AcO is much like a coming home.... a cosmic duvet, full of insightful and perfectly acceptable fluff ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I've got some on the way and I can't wait to try it. Sounds like the most interesting tryptamine for me. I like that alot of people say it's pretty visual, as I haven't had a truly visually exciting trip in a long time.

^Well Ive tried a confirmed batch of 5-MeO-MiPT more recently which did produce very interesting visuals and was rather intense. However I got no cosmic revelelations and was not as far into the outreaches of space as I was that one trip. Who knows. Sometimes it seems that trips can vary more widely just between set and setting rather than by drug.

I am sorry to hear that. ApproXimotly 11mg (5-MeO-MiPT) produced an energized cocaine like high that last near 4 hours, which happened to be first exposure to Shpongle. That was fun. After the 4 to 5 one began slipping into light trance states in which there were intense hallucinations but no psychedelica.


4-AcO-MiPT is a lovely compound in that it is very gentle and can put your mind at the edge, the edge that 4-HO-DMT at similar doses would have you tumbling over and down and into.


Also, I've mentioned before that there was noticed a very real difference in the metabolization of 4-AcO-MiPT Hcl and the fumarate. Has anyone else noticed a difference in effect between these two salts?

A small amount of this substance just fell out of the sky today, and I think I shall now partake. Cheers!


Edit: This is definately my new favorite psychedelic. I hadn't laughed so much at the utter absurdity of it all since......


Well it was a blast. The only thing that bugs me is that I cannot get visuals at all anymore. But that's not the point. I do miss them but I realize they are not what the experince is for really.

I spent a day out in the sunshine yesterday with this beautiful substance and I feel that this is where it really shines- outdoors. Alot of people prefer outdoor tripping, but this is the first chem that I truly think demands nature to really manifest it's full potential; at least for me. And I didn't need a benzo either.

4-aco-mipt is probably my favorite chemical. I've only tried it once with about 40 mg and it was so much better and psychedelic than any crappy 2ce, doc etc. stuff. No physical problems and a great feeling afterwards. It really opened up my head but it digged a few problems which I didn't want to deal with and I noticed that controlling it is useless. The visuals, and the mind effects aren't even comparable to anything I've tried (as intense as DXM + LSD). Haven't tried other mushroom chemicals except mushrooms many times but they don't compare at all mostly because they don't have the amazing brain boost power but rather cloud the mind.

^^ Mushrooms cloud your mind?  Weird... many people find mushrooms to be the most mental and spiritual 4-substituted tryptamine, and perhaps the most of any psychedelic.  At least I do.

Iprocin was far more 'spiritual' for me than mushrooms.  I only tried 4-AcO-MiPT once, at a threshold dose...but it was VERY nice and I felt a lot of potential.   Shame I never went back.  I'm sure one day though I will try it again.

Hehe, Shpongle is fun. Well, the one fairly enjoyable experience I had on 5-MeO-MIPT was actually consuming media... went to the cinema to see a Star Wars film. As soon as I0m stuck with just me, the compound seems really freaky. A bit like a strong dose of DMT without the amazing visuals, and I felt like I was metallic and green (hard to explain, just didn't feel right).


When you say "difference in the metabolization" - are you referring to physical effects (body load) or mental effects (quality of the experience), or length of (the various stages of) the experience?


Regarding the difference in effect between the two salts, I cannot say as I have not yet sampled the fumarate salt. I had one experience with what I think was the Hcl, and that was a bit different from my experiences with what I was told is the freebase. But my experience with the HCl was my first with the compound and at a low dose, so it's hard to say.


I have had two different salts of 2C-B though. Both the HCl and the HBr. And while I know that the HCl is more potent, I found that compensating for that by adding around 25% of one's usual HCl dose to have the equivalent amount of bioavailable 2C-B  from the Hbr still doesn't make for a comparable experience. Somehow the 2C-B HBr I had the chance to try feels different from the 2C-B HCl, even though they're both 2C-B and definitely not any other 2C-x that I have tried.

Both mental and physical, the Hcl and the fumarate salts seemed to produce noticably different experiences on both fronts. I apologize for not being able to be more clear on the matter, but I think you get the gist of what I'm trying to convey, as your discription of 2C-B HCl and HBr sounds exactly like what I'm trying to say about the other two salts in my question.

/\ Yeah I didn't try to attempt to describe the differences with the 2C-B as it doesn't belong in this thread.And because it's hard to pinpoint what exactly it is. But there's something that makes it quite different.

Im really egear to try this one as I once had a very powerful trip that was supposedly 20mg of 5-MeO-MiPT, however it was really really out there, so I supsect it must have been something else. I recently tried 24mg 5-MeO-MiPT, and a 50/50 33mg mix of 5-MeO-MiPT and 4-Ho-MiPT which caused me to vomit as well. Neither had me in the place I was on that one trip. I am beggining to think it might have been a one time thing. I got no nausea whatsoever and the come up was fast and the trip was intensely psychedelic. I am beggining to suspect it was 4-AcO-MiPT, and I'm hoping it was because I have access to it right now and am awaiting a day for a trial. I am hoping it was 4-AcO-MiPT because I want that experience again.

Ethocin (4-ho-det) + low-dose P. harmala + MDMA (susp.) worked out fine. Was not as strong as expected. Never tried miprocin w/ MAOI, to my recollection. Would not reccomend rue+miprocin, as rue is accompanied by body load (uncomfortable for most), also sometimes amplifies intensity+duration beyond the comfort zone for most.

Me, my GF and two close friends all tried this out last night.  19 and 19 respectively for the girls, 21 for my friend, 23 for myself (freebase).


Oh man, what a night.  I haven't laughed like that since..EVER.  It actually got painful towards the end, but we couldn't stop laughing.  This is my 2nd trial with this chem, the first was maybe 1.5 years ago, dosed out into a gelcap so I'm unsure of the dosage (it was the fum, and I think around 30mg).


By far the most 'recreational' psychedelic I've ever used.  I was tripping, and hard at that, but I couldn't control my laughter.  As I'm typing this, my torso and shit aches a little bit from 3 hours of endless laughter.

i know that snorting alot of rc's is rather effective,

If you believe eating mushrooms and going to a rave would be enjoyable, than go for it.  As benign as it is on the body, you should be comfortable.

I've had great luck with recrystalization.  Just dissolve it in a small amount of hot water, and let the water evaporate off.  Crystals are lots easier to work with than powder.

I think this is a personal thing. If you can't answer it for youself right now, then that probably means you haven't done enough 'research' with the chemical to know if that one would be a good one to take in public. Try it in private first.


They effect everyone different (I have friends that are floored with the 4-substituted-Ts and would NOT like to be in public on them).


Be careful lest you end up in a situation not healthy for yourself.

OT I know but I agree with this assessment of 5-meo-mipt at this dosage level completely. The visuals at T+7-8 for me on 5meomipt are very very weird and unlike any visuals I've ever had (minus any real headfuck).

I tried 25mg of 4-AcO-MiPT fumarate for the first time yesterday.  Although I am quite experienced with phenethylamines, it was my first tryptamine experience.  I found it intensely confusing.  We were all **very** confused.  Phenethylamines make me feel smarter, but this made me feel dumber!  We constantly found ourselves asking very basic questions, like "What's going on?"  "What did he go to do?"  "Why did I come here again?"  "Where did I leave xxx?"  I noticed that the visuals had a very unique quality.  There was a lot of rotation, which I've never seen before.  Posters on the wall were turning around in circles.  The pattern was nowhere near as intricate as a phenethylamine, but it was moving and scrunching around like none other.  Also, it was very difficult to tell the chronology of the experience.  With a phenethylamine, I'm able to take a look at myself and determine exactly where I am in the trip and how much longer I've got to go, but with this it was impossible to tell anything.  I know I felt it fifteen minutes after eating it, and I know that six hours afterwards it was almost entirely gone, but that's all.  If this whole experience is characteristic of tryptamines, I'm not sure why people like them so much!  The only thing I found potentially useful is the fact that, in asking myself "why?" all the time, I looked really far back.  When I was eating corn, I kept thinking about my ancestors before me growing their corn and eating it, and weird stuff like that.  Otherwise, it was far to confusing to get anything of value out of the experience.


Am I unique in my response to tryptamines?  I'm working on acquiring some more to see if perhaps others are more useful, and I sure hope that they are, but this was not at all what I was expecting!

I wouldn't expect you to be able to get a good feel for tryptamines on the first time.  They tend to be much more mentally hectic.  But through that hecticity can come great insight.  And yes, I realize I invented a new word there.

**my thoughts**


bought 1g of this about a yr ago and have really enjoyed it, and so have the friends with whom i've shared it.  for me this is a social, sensual drug.  it's not for exploring the outer reaches, like i find 2c-e to be.


14-16mg (imo) is the sweet spot for this chem; a great social, hang out dose.  i've given that dose to about 6 people of different genders, ages and weights and they've all had a blast.  manageable visuals @ the 14-16mg level, giddy humor, quick conversation.  doesn't make you dumb.  driving 4 hours after popping a capsule is possible (ymmv).  comes on in 15 minutes.


8mg is also a good, social, "i don't want people to know i'm on anything" dose.  mood lift, sharp mind, great for a low key party.  driving not a problem after a couple of hours (ymmv).


sex @ any relatively lowish dose, duo or solo, is fucking great with this stuff too (subjective, maybe).  i recall 1 occasion when the 1st alert of a 14mg dose was a violent, animal rush of erotic energy (as opposed to nausea or something).  and i was in a non-sexual setting w/my attention focused on a menial task prepping for the trip.


finally,  you can even snort it w/out a problem.  the drip doesn't tast too sweet, but no pain @ all.  i think bumping salt would be more painful. 


even sleeping isn't tough, there's no long, lingering edgy trail.  baseline comes pretty soon after comedown, ime. 


i don't think 4-aco-mipt is perfect.  tolerance develops quickly.  an hour after taking the initial dose i would not redose; not much will happen.  noticed cross tolerance w/2-ce.  4-aco-mipt does make my friend vomit - but only at 20+mgs.  i don't find it useful in higher doses.  i don't find it useful for reaching deep psychedelic states.  and of course no one knows the long term impact of ingesting this substance.

^^^ yes!!! thank you for posting that!!


This is about EXACTLY what I am looking for with mipracetyl...I hope it works out the same for me and company as it does for you and company.


I have it from good sources (ximot) that this drug is very euphoric and much like you describe. I can't wait to try it...I've tried a few 4-substituted-Tryptamines now, but have yet to try the mipt versions.


peace and thanks for posting! (now I want to try it EVEN more!),

definitely agree with alot of phillo's points, i got the same "violent, animal rush of erotic energy" you described in the same way at the same point in my 24mg mipracetin (mipracetyl?) trip. this also happened once with LSD, but that was a long time ago.


this substance is so physically benign, i probably could have slept ON the peak if i wanted (at least at 16mg).


i just wish i knew what a FULL +++ was like. i only got to experiment up to 24mg, & it left me wanting to go deeper. *sigh* no more 4-aco-mipt for me.

I think the next time I take a tryptamine it will be 4-AcO-MiPT... I only tried it once or twice and it was during a lot of tryptamine tolerance.  Either that or it'll be IM DPT.

I wonder if people have combined this with AMT? I'm thinking about doing that when I try it...I want to IM about 10mg of AMT (this should be equal to about 25-30mg oral but last a much shorter time) and then eat around 20mg of 4-AcO-MiPT once the AMT has kicked in.


Should be just as good a combo as AMT + psilacetin, no?


Personal experiences?

i believe it probably will, assuming it's pure.  the people who took this substance varied greatly - from 120lbs to 250 lbs, some more experienced than others, male/female, all over the place.  the reactions were very consistent and i haven't always found that to be the case w/other rcs.

my impression w/this substance is that there is no really deep place to go.  or maybe, the unpleasantness of a high dose would overpower any psychedelic introspection.  BUT, a lot of you guys successfully manage heroic doses of these substances.  feelgood, maybe a 50mg dose would really show you the light?

**4-ACO-MIPT Discoloration?**


A sample of 4 aco mipt fumarate salt has been stored at room temperature for several months.  originally it was a tannish ...slightly brown color.  but now it has changed, become darker nearing black or dark brown in some spots.  The bag has never been opened.  So I ask the following

A) has it degraded in potency

B) has it changed chemically, specifically in a way that would be dangerous


basically could it still be used for testing or should it be discarded or somewhere in between?

Thats unfortunate to hear as shulgin remarked on how n,n-mipt is remarkably stable, i was always under the impression that its substitutions would have similar longevity.

since other 4-acetylated tryptamines like 4-aco-det and 4-aco-dipt have not been reported to have toxic products of degradation, i would imagine it is fairly safe. In fact it should degrade into 4-ho-mipt before becoming fully inactive (or then does it degrade into n,n-mipt?)

If your worried start small and carefully observe the effects, make sure to note if its just discoloration or true degradation (loss of potency) and report back to us. If your REALLY worried pour it down the drain or donate it to a mipt kitchen for psychonauts in hunger.


Does anyones else have reports of mipt or its substitutions becoming discolored or loosing potency?

^It could be oxidisation. I don't know how that effects the compound though, but I have known people to get white freebase -DMT's that 'rust' for no forseable reason. 

When you say testing, do you mean bioassay? Be careful- but as far as I know it will have only effected the amount of 4-Aco-MIPT.

thanks for the imput.  if it has oxidized will that change the potency?  

also it is different shapes in different areas, some is almost the original tan, so it may be slowly oxidizing.

I can't speak for 4-AcO-MiPT, but my 4-AcO-DET has turned from a fine white powder to sandy charcoal-coloured granules over the course of 4 years (I think) in reasonably good storage conditions. It did not seem to lose potency, nor produce any toxic effects. 


Very strange.

Sorry if this has been brought up.  I didn’t want to read through 8 pages in hopes to find an answer.


I’ve had 4-AcO-MiPT for a few weeks, about 120mg.  It’s the last my supplier made and I have no access to it any longer.  They were in caps of 20mg each that all got soaked with water.  All the MiPT is still in the caps but they are melted.  The MiPT turned black and looks like it had expanded, but it’s hard to tell.  They may have been sitting in water for as long as a week.  One thing that worries me most is in another container I had empty caps which were covered in fungus from being soaked as well.  The MiPT caps don’t seam to have any fungus.  So my question is, is this safe to ingest?  I really hope so as I threshold this chemical once and saw a ton of potential for me.

Have you tested this yet? I'm in the same boat.  Mine got wet and turned black.  My biggest concern is empty capsules in another bag near the 4-AcO-MiPT grew mold on them from getting wet.

For 5-MeO-DMT oxidization changes the potency.  My supplyier has been providing oxidized 5-MeO-DMT for several months now.  He said it doesn't effect the effects of the substance and that it is safe for consumption but lost allot of potency.  He provides me with 50% more when it's oxidized and that sounds about right to make up for the loss of potency.

I also find the come-up fast and with minimal body load though I can be restless and twitchy a bit during the first hour (this often happens with tryptamines).  It also makes me shiver quite a lot even when sitting outside in the sun.


10mg seemed like quite a lot but it calmed down significantly after the peak.  Strangely enough, listening to loud psychedelic music brought me straight back to baseline (until I tried to talk to people) but bassy dubstep was extremely spacey and psychedelic while guitar bands seemed distant and small as though they were Lilliputians.

About 6 months ago I bought 2 20mg capsules of pure 4-AcO-MiPT one night and took one immediately. About an hour and a half in, i didn't think I was tripping very hard, so I took the other. Then about 15 minutes after that, I freaked out when I realized that was a stupid decision and induced vomiting to try and not kill myself accidentally. (I remembered some other RCs that could possibly cause death with too high a dose, remembered this was a fairly non-studied chemical and decided I didn't want to find out the lethal dose) Luckily, I had absorbed enough to make me trip, as I was already starting to trip and just didn't realize it when I took the second. 


It  was a really speedy high, and I distinctly remember 3 separate phases of the trip(which I felt was really long). First I was tripping balls, sounds were being amplified visually, and waves of energy were coming out of everything. Then, while continuing this feeling, I started to have this extreme desire to have lots and lots of sex, which was pretty interesting, as everyone else i was with noted the same thing. I felt great, like I'd imagine someone on MDMA would feel like (unfortunately, never tried it). Then, after a while, that feeling started to die down and I just started to feel straight up cracked out while tripping balls. We were all standing around, talking a mile a minute and pacing the floors.


 One of my friend couldn't come inside from our back porch for a few hours, so while i was out there with him the sun rose, which was just awesome. There was dew on the trees around our back yard, and when the sun hit them there were just amazing crystalline structures branching everywhere, covering the trees. It was probably one of the most beautiful things I've seen.


 4-AcO-MiPT is a great RC in my opinion, although my experience is probably different from most peoples, as the weekend that I took them was the same week I took way too many psychs. I can't remember exactly, but I know I took shrooms on the wednesday and thursday before, then maybe drank that friday, then did this stuff that saturday.


 Anyways, I thought the comedown was awesome. We all stayed up all night, then I proceeded to walk around campus on the speedy (not time wise, just feeling) for a few hours until about noon. It was very gradual, no bad feelings other than being tired somewhat, and I took a nice nap that afternoon and was fine. 


Has anyone else ever ingested as much of this substance as I did? I didn't even tell any of my friends that night how much I'd taken(I actually didn't tell anyone ever) due to the fact that it was our impression that each 20 mg capsule was a strong dose in the first place. My inducing vomiting (which I only did because I was unsure of the LD-50 of this drug, better safe than sorry eh?) probably affected my absorption, but I'm sure i ingested over 20 mg, as it was about 15 minutes after I took the second capsule and over an hour since the first. The capsules were those gel ones that dissolve really quickly, and i'm fairly sure it was ~100% pure chemical, the volume of the powder in the capsule was minuscule. 


Hopefully I'll get to try it again one day, I'd make sure I didn't use anything for several days prior too, to make sure I got the full experience. My friends and I now describe that drug as a perfect all in one combo: Trip like on acid or something, feel great and want lots of sex like on e, then feel like your on amps or some stimulant and still be tripping the entire time, minus a shitty comedown.


Edit: If I come across this stuff again I'll make sure to do a full trip report. I'm fairly certain most people don't really know much about it and its quite a fun experience.

^^ Sure, people have taken more, although you did take a high dose.  It was definitely better to be safe than sorry, but don't worry, the tryptamines are for the most part quite physically safe.  40mg is not enough to hurt you, although it's certainly enough to trip harder than you had bargained for. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The 4-AcO-Ts, especially the freebases, are unstable, probably because the acetyl group seems to like to dislodge and go other places like the 3 position.  I don't think this has any impact on potency, tests of the degraded compounds before has yielded only very small amounts of the other compounds present.

I have found my 4-AcO-tryptamine fumarate salts (which it seems most are being made as now due to stability) to be more stable than any 4-HO-tryptamines I have received.  Actually, I have some HCls also that have not appeared to degrade (although who knows, they may have, but they're still pure white).

Any recommendations for first time users on this substance? 


Obviously, start at the 10-15 mg range. I have read and understand that it may be a bad idea to mix it with alcohol, and that vomiting is possible.


Several people recommend bumping, but there is not really a high comfort level with that. If it is going to be consumed orally, would a capsul or mixing it with liquid be more effective?


The powder has been sealed but has not been kept in the freezer. There has been a low level of discoloration, but it is certainly not black and has not liquified at all. From what I have read here, I understand that it is acceptable for this compound to discolor somewhat.


Does eating alter the effectiveness or comeup for this compound?


Is anyone aware of any dangerous interactions?


I have read most of this thread, but may have missed something, sorry if I missed the answers to these questions.

Just a heads up to avoid combining provigil with 4-aco-mipt. One of the worst psychedelic experiences I have had. 200mg provigil followed by 10mg 4-aco-mipt about 4 hours later produced significant nausea, tachacardia and severe tinnitus. The trip also never really got going, just a flu-like feeling and some trails. Last night sucked hard, and I still dont feel quite back to normal. Tread with caution...

i'm not sure what provigil is (goes to look it up) but if it causes a reaction with 4-aco-mipt, it can be assumed it causes a reaction with all tryptamines/serotonergic psychedelics.  Just an expansion to your warning.

^its also known as modafinil or benzhydrilsulphinylacetamide (sp?). Its a stimulant used as a smart drug

Some ideas about combining with psychedelics here: [http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/4565945/Main/4558924](https://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/4565945/Main/4558924)


This guy ([http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58332](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58332)) claims it made his mushroom trip more intense in an enjoyable way.


Don't want to derail the thread (mods, please split if you want), but does anyone have any first hand experience combining modafinil with serotonergic psychedelics, especially DMT?

Modafinil definitely alters the effects of mushrooms; visuals seem substantially reduced in intensity, but one is left with the most intense syrupy colours and greater euphoria than one would expect from mushrooms alone. Aspects of the mental effects seem to be intensified somewhat as well, but with little disorientation. I ended up in a mall while trying this combination; this is something I tend to avoid while on psychedelics (though I don't have problems with most public places), but  I had no problems and I actually rather enjoyed it.


Acid didn't seem substantially altered, but I only tested it with 100 mg of modafinil and one and a half hits of what turned out to be rather weak blotter.


Further thread derailment: Does anyone have experience combining 4-aco-mipt or any other of the newer tryptamines with a racetam?

Not to derail the thread, but I have significant experience with Modafinil, as I have a prescription for it--so I figured I should respond to the speculation above.


The most relevant interaction that Modafinil causes is due to its /induction/ of CYP3A4.  This is consistent with macropsia's report of /reduced/ visuals with psilocybin.


That said, Modafinil is a strong substance and shouldn't be combined with anything that can cause tension or nervousness--particularly norepinephrine activity.  It won't necessarily kill you, but I don't think it would ever be desirable to combine something like Modafinil with most psychedelics, which often have a certain degree of tension associated with them during the come-up anyway.


Something that could potentially be interesting would be the combination of 2C-C, a relatively relaxing psychedelic, with Modafinil.  However, this is purely speculation, and generally speaking I don't feel Modafinil is a good choice to combine with anything.

Thnx but you are aware of the fact that I said **4-HO-MiPT** fumarate or **4-AcO-MiPT** HCl?

Because I know that the fumarate salt of tryptamines are generally (or always) more stable, but what I was wondering is which of those different salts of 2 different compounds can be better kept. My 'guess' is that 4-HO-MiPT is less stable even if it's a better salt. Oxidation to goo and stuff like that sounds nasty.

Reason I'm asking as you probably figure is that I'm interested in the two similar substances but want to store it longterm should I get it.

Sorry yeah, sleep deprivation does that.  My instinct would be to agree with you.  The AcO ester probably provides more stability even with the HCl salt than the fumarate would.

Silica in a dessicator works great.  Even the freebase of 4-HO-MiPT is pretty stable at room temperature if you keep it really dry and sealed.

sorry to dig up such an old thread.. but I can not find the informal name for 4-AcO-MiPT..


I have these so far:


4-AcO-DiPT (Ipracetin)

4-HO-MiPT (Miprocin)

4-AcO-DMT (Psilacetin)

4-HO-DiPT (Iprocin)

4-AcO-DET (Ethacetin / Ethylacybin)

4-Acetoxy-MET (Methecetin)

4-HO-MET (Metocin)


but I don't know what 4-Aco-MiPT is called.. does anyone know?

Great spring day to go to the park, went pretty smooth!


I took 30 mg of the freebase spreaded across 3 doses.

Remarkably visual right now.


It's good that I get to read a bit of older stuff because I

had never given the interaction of modafinil with psyche-

lics that much thought...  something to very much look out for it seems!

So I have 500 mg of 4-AcO-MiPT freebase on its way.


A few posts up Nuke noted that 4-HO-MiPT freebase is fairly stable at room temp when dry and sealed.


I'm wondering if I leave this in the baggie it comes in, open it and remove as much air as posible, place it next to a bag of sillica inside a larger baggie and place it in the freezer, will this remain stable for an extended period of time?  


I don't know when I will have the chance to get through this much material and I am hoping to have it for up to a few years.


I'm also wondering if the hydroxy is more stable than the acetate? Is 4-HO-MiPT more stable than 4-AcO-MiPT?


This is the first time I have received any freebase tryptamine. They have usually always been fumarate and rarely hydrochloride and I am a little worried about losing potency.


I was also considering stocking up with an additional gram of 4-AcO-MiPT freebase as it is a very good reduced price right now. Would this be pointless if I don't plan on going through 500 mg within a year at the earliest, and wouldn't go through 1.5 grams withint at least 3 years?


Any help is appreciated.

i always thought salts were more stable, especially fumurate (which is why they started using it for trypts, which are not as stable as PEA's.)

HCl salt would be easy to produce, but I'm not sure how it's gonna behave to be honest.

^ Ya I realize salts are more stable, fumarate being more stable than hydrochloride and hydrochloride more stable than freebase. The person I'm getting it from has 4-HO-MiPT fumarate but interestingly 4-AcO-MiPT freebase. I'm thinking they got 4-AcO-MiPT freebase because 4-AO-MiPT requires a larger dose than 4-HO-MiPT. Having the 4-AcO-MiPT as a freebase would make the potency closer to 4-HO-MiPT fumarate.


I'm still wondering: 


If I had 4-AcO-MiPT in a baggie with as much air taken out as possible and placed the baggie into a larger baggie next to a bag of silica, would it keep it's potency for a few years if kept in a freezer? I usually quadruple bag all of my tryptamines and freeze them next to silica, but I'm hesitant with this being a tryptamine, which is already less stable than many other chems, as well as being in freebase form. 


Would it be wise to convert it to hydrochloride?


I have next to zilch understanding of chemistry, but if there is a layman's process for converting 4-AcO-MiPT freebase into hydrochloride I would consider trying it out if it is necessary.

Since I have never used a dessicant with any of my RCs before, I am curious on how dessicants would be used... Would it be as Love_sex_desire says to place the dessicant in a second baggie that encloses the baggie with the original chemical?

You don't place the silica in a 2nd baggie. Usually it already comes in a baggie, in shoeboxes and thing like that, so I simply place the baggie of silica next to the baggie of goodies, and place that in a larger baggie and usually triple bag it on top of that. 


I go a little insane with wrapping bags over bags. Usually starting with a dime bag, then a slightly larger bag, then a "snacks" sized ziplock, then a sandwich sized ziplock, then onto a "Freshness Sealed" freezer baggie, and finally onto a large freezer baggie. Probably overkill but the extra few seconds it takes unpacking and repacking is worth knowing I've stored my goodies as safely as possible ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i only have experience storing DMT and 5 meo DMT as freebase.

5 meo dmt freebase after a couple years became discolored but lost very little potency if any.


DMT was held onto for probably 5 months at the longest without negligible loss in potency, but again it did become discolored.

if i were to guess, i would say it would be fine kept in the conditions you described.

Or if you have a vac-sealer, that would insure it stays good even longer. (less contact with oxygen)

prbably the best thing you could do.

So I got my 4-AcO-MiPT freebase in today. Luckily it is just slightly off-white and doesn't look like it has been subjected to much oxidization. I've got it in the freezer and have high hopes for it to retain it's potency. Fingers crossed.


This may have been answered but I'm wondering if someone can compare 4-AcO-MiPT to 4-HO-MiPT.


From my understanding 4-AcO-MiPT will take a little longer to come up compared to 4-HO-MiPT and last a little bit longer?


I also understand that 4-AcO-MiPT requires a higher dose compared to 4-HO-MiPT. How much 4-AcO-MiPT fumarate would be equal to around 20 mg of 4-HO-MiPT fumarate?


I'm also wondering how the effects differ. I've noticed some people say that 4-AcO-MiPT is funner and possibly less serious compared to 4-HO-MiPT, but if anyone has done both and can compare the two, I would appreciate as many details as possible.


Lastly, if you have tried 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT, which one do you find more valuabale?

^ My understanding is that freezers are dry. Any moisture in a freezer is frozen.


I keep my tryptamines in a baggie with as much air removed as possible. I then place the baggie next to a bag of silica gel. This keeps moisture out. I then double baggie the tryptamine and silica gel and put it into a lockbox in my freezer. When I need to take anything out I take the lock box out and let it thaw out completely before opening the lock box, even though there is rarely any mositure on the lockbox after thawing, and none that is noticeable upon opening up the lockbox. 


The lock box seems to keep out all possible moisture and the silica gels would absorb what minimal amount of moiture might get through. By allowing the lock box to completely thaw out before opening the lockbox and taking the baggies out I highly doubt any moisture would get through. 


Freezers are dry! I don't understand why you state that keeping chemicals in a freezer will allow moisture to get in. I think most people agree that storing tryptamines in a freezer is the best way to keep them in a cool, dark, dry place.


I also have never heard that freebase is more stable than hydrochloride and fumarate. Fumarate and Hydrochloride are salts and it is generally known that salts are more stable than freebase. Many people have stated that freebase is the least stable, hydrochloride the next best and fumarate is the most stable. That is why most tryptamines come as a fumarate salt.


Can anyone confirm that freebase is more stable than hydrochloride and fumarate?


Can anyone confirm that freezers are not dry? I don't understand how moisture could get through a lockbox, a few baggies and silica gel in a freezer, where all moisture is frozen.


I'm sorry but nothing in your post about storage made any sense to me. If anyone or if Love in a Vein can confirm that freebase is more stable than hydrochloride and fumarate and that moisture is present in a freezer I would appreciate any more information.


I've had all of my tryptamines stored in freezers and the longest I have had any tryptamines stored in a freezer thus far is for about 6 months without any loss of potency. These were fumarate salts.


Why would many vendors start supplying fumarate and hydrochloride salts rather than freebase, if in fact freebase is the most stable form?


If anyone has any information, please let me know if Love in a Vein or if I am correct.

**Has anyone here actually witnessed degradation when storing in the freezer?**


I'd like my collection to last for *many many* years, so I have been storing in a freezer. Specifically, I have:


 - A mason jar that is sealed tight

 - The jar is filled with rice and also has a silica pack in it

 - Chems are in little doubled-ziplocks, stuffed inside the rice pool.

 - I let it thaw before opening the jar


I don't think moisture would be an issue. On the other hand, it does concern me that some people here store in only baggies in the freezer. Bags are not airtight, so I would be more concerned with that...

Heat epsom salt until compleet deshydratation, put the powder in a little tissue bag, put the bad in a tight close plastic box with your chemicals, and the box in a black plasic bag.

Just stored my tuff like that at room temperature for at least a year without degradation.

Would a mason jar not have air in it though? Unless it was filled to the brim, there would still be air in the jar. I like the idea of putting rice in the jar. Do you have the jar filled to the top with rice to take up as much space as possible, thus leaving little room for air?


I have all of my chems (except AMT. Gotta store that stinky shit separate!) double or triple baggied with silica in between them and they are stored in a lockbox. This is a picture of what I keep them in:


[http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=&webid=638859&affixedcode=WW](http://www.staples.ca/ENG/Catalog/cat_sku.asp?CatIds=&webid=638859&affixedcode=WW)


It's a business card holder lock box. I've had tryptamines stored for almost a year with no noticeable loss in potency. Do you think oxidization would be a problem with my storage method?

I do indeed fill it to the top with rice. I'm getting extra paranoid though, so I think that the next time I take it out, I'll be replacing the rice with bulk silica.

For the time being I have access to medecine bottles and larger vials that are not air tight. I think for the time being I'll store my 4-AcO-MiPT freebase along with my hydrochloride tryptamines in the medecine bottle with silica.


From what I heard in ADD fumarate is very stable and hydrochloride is actually only a little more stable than freebase, so until I get a better storage method I think storing the freebase and hydrochloride tryptamines in a couple baggies with silica, in a medecine bottle placed in a lockbox in the freezer will do for now.


Thanks for the info, and if anyone has any other advice for storing freebase tryptamines, especially 4-AcO-MiPT, please pipe up!

Damn you are lazy indeed, like your suggests. You can find the structure of MIPT by checking 4-HO-MIPT in Tihkal. Now substitute the Hydroxy-Group (OH) with an Acetoxy-Group (CH3-C(=O)-O) and you got yourself a molecule.

Here's a picture of 4-HO-MIPT: [http://tinyurl.com/4homiptstructure](https://tinyurl.com/4homiptstructure)

And here's the AcO group: [http://tinyurl.com/acetoxygroupstructure](https://tinyurl.com/acetoxygroupstructure)


The "fourth" Carbon atom has an OH attached (top left). Remove that, remove the "R" from the other image and stick the two together. The sum formulas would be (if my math is correct): 

C14H19N2O for 4-HO-MIPT,

C2H3O2 for the Acetoxy group and

C16H21N2O2 for 4-AcO-MIPT


Note: If you are planning to print this on a t-shirt or something, remember there might be a lot of structural isomers that share the same sum formula, but have a completely different structure and pharmacological behaviour.


Edit: You want to do research on the substance? Lol my guess is you're trying to order some from China, India or whereever the hell these people sit nowadays. Well, either way, these are your options, all refer to 4-AcO-MIPT, if I'm correct:

3-[2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl]-4-acetoxy- indole [IUPAC]

4-acetoxy-indole,3-[2-(isopropylmethylamino)ethyl]

4-acetoxy-n-isopropyl-n-methyltryptamine

3-[2-(isopropylmethylamino)ethyl]-4-acetoxy-indole


Should you actually be trying to do research on these (as you claim) which I strongly doubt, then bluelight would really be your best choice. I haven't seen any publications on exotic tryptamines like this one on pub med and I doubt google will yield better results. You'd better search Psilocin on pub med which is probably the only well researched substance with a comparable pharmacological profile and try to get your hands on some publications.


Edit2: I see you deleted your post, my edit wasn't needed then I guess... :D

I was wondering, I don't know a whole lot about some of the 4-HO/AcO tryptamines, I have a fair bit of experience with 4-AcO-DMT and I know a lot about 4-HO-MET, but how does 4-AcO-MiPT (and it's -HO cousin) compare to 4-AcO-DMT? Firstly in the headspace, and secondly in it's visuals.


4-HO-MET sounded great to me aside from the fact that it lacked a lot of the introspective side of 4-AcO-DMT, which for me is it's main attraction. I recently got access to 4-AcO-MiPT as well as some others, so I thought I'd ask about how other 4-substituted tryptamines, 4-AcO-MiPT in particular, compare.

Don't discount 4-HO-MET... Just because it doesn't have the introspective side doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile chem... Its fantastic and will knock you so far out of it that your mind is completely blank. You exist in everything and nothing at the same time.


As for 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT - they're nowhere near as visual as the other two but much more giggly and traditional low dose shroom-like. You can get some nice CEVs from them and they're both definitely the most stimulating of the 4-sub tryptamines (particularly 4-HO-MiPT) but they have their own character... I don't really get a mind fuck from most things but I certainly did from 4-HO-MiPT. We got lost in thought loops and laughter loops for a good two hours, had auditory distortions, the works. Its worth trying out though 4-HO-MET and 4-AcO-DMT are lighter on the body.

I'm not discounting it, but it's just not what I'm looking for in particular at this moment in time. I don't think there's any psychedelic I don't see worth trying, but I'm looking for something specific right now.


Bodyload doesn't really concern me as even with 2C-E which is said to have extreme bodyload I encounter very little of the sort, just a little discomfort but nothing worrying. Lack of visuals doesn't concern me too much either, as while visuals are nice it's the headspace I'm interested in.


Would you say the mindfuck/instrospection of 4-HO and 4-AcO-MiPT is more or less present than with 4-AcO-DMT?

4-HO-MiPT - Very intense come up, very stimulating. At times I was completely out of this world. Mentally very intense, but it dosent feel spiritual, more speed like, where your mind is all over the place. I was thinking about all sorts of crazy delusional shit that made perfect sense at the time. Very strong visuals, I spent a fair amount of time staring at a plant and basically controlling its movements with my mind.


4-AcO-MiPT - Lasts a bit longer than its hydroxyl cousin - the effects seems more drawn out. The comeup is longer and dosent hit you all at once like miprocin. Less intense mentally, but it still takes you for a ride. Non visual for me.(I dont get much visuals from 4-aco-trypts).


Both of these are more intense than 4-aco-dmt for me, but they are different. I would say techno/alien/synthetic mushrooms is a good description of miprocin. It lacks the therapeutic component of 4-aco-dmt.

^^ that's a pretty good description though I didn't find either of them particularly visual. What doses were you doing?


And as for a comparison with AcO-DMT, that shit fucked with my head a lot less from the one trial I had with it. The 4-sub MiPT chems will make you think the most illogical shit not only makes sense but is totally hilarious.

Miprocin - 60mg.

4-aco-mipt - 50mg.


Note. I have a bit of natural tolerance to tryptamines, so I usually dose on the high end. And I like the trip to be intense.

Largest Miprocin dose I ever took was 40mg... It was pretty visual at that dose... but considering that it was 3 bills a gram at the time, as was 4-AcO-MiPT, the dose/response curve was not tight enough for me.

What are the differences in potency between 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT? Let's assume fumarate as that is most commonly available?


I'd like to hear more comparisons between the two but I am interested in how much more potent per mg 4-HO-MiPT is compared to 4-AcO-MiPT.

^ I would say miprocin is 1.1 - 1.3x more potent per. mg. depending on dose taken. I have worked with both in fumarate salt form.

I was reading the TiHKAL entry on 4-HO-MiPT earlier & most reports of the acetate ester note that it is sedating, however a lot of the discussion in this thread & TR's i've read elsewhere seem to indicate otherwise.  Thoughts?

SO sedating with my one experience from it, a friend and I took 15 mg each of 4-AcO-MiPT, became sloth like and then passed out while experiencing no discomfort, actually unless my memory is failing me this may have been the most comfortable tryptamine I have ever taken. We listened to music for 3 hours and the whole time I was laying on the floor thinking of people and watching CEVs of slight patterns morphing into one another, more resembling LSD than anything else I've ever had. enticing! back with another report on this one soon!

4-Aco/4-HO-tryptamines aren't stable enough for this. 

Someone on another forum I go to tried it with 4-AcO-DMT and the stuff turned black and did nothing.

in all likelihood it would be an extremely inefficient ROA.  If you wanna convert some to freebase & vape it, then by all means go ahead, but i wouldn't expect it to work very well for the reasons TheAzo mentioned.  Where did you hear about people doing it successfully with 4-AcO-DET?  The only tryptamines i'm aware of that are effective through that ROA are the 5-MeO ones and the simple ones, like DMT, DPT, DiPT, etc.

^ it's a little easier than 4-AcO-DMT, 4-AcO-MiPT is SUCH a smooth ride, unheard of from anything else ive ever taken. seems very recreational yet available o depth but while still keeping one relatively together and in tact... I felt capable of holding up a convo with a friend but had no desire to, 4-AcO-MiPT just took me gently downstream.. dancing visuals and a comforting set of body sedation and euphoria that just had me very comfortable.

did 80mg yesterday


was at a +4(obviously with that much right?)


hardest I have ever tripped in my life


words/text were actually backwards


shit was fucking insane


has an antidepressant/happy vibe about it just like mushrooms


the visuals at this point were way to intense


time slowed down/my voiced sounded slow mo


after hours, I had to abort the mission with trazodone which got me back to baseline in less than 5 minutes

^ lol at that dose, I imagine you must've been tripping for at least 10 hours  before you decided to cut it out. Imagine how long you would've been tripping if you hadn't downed the Trazadone! 28mg of 4-ho-mipt had me tripping for 13 hours before I could drink enough to pass out... And there were still residuals for a long while after!

Will be taking this for the first time this week. Really excited for this one. 


Noticed there is no image in the RC Reagent test thread ([here)](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=512598) for 4-aco-mipt nor 4-ho-DIPT which is funny because those are the two compounds I will be trying for the first time in the coming weeks. 


I have no way to verify to a certainty that what I have is  4-ho-dipt (HCl) or 4-aco-mipt(freebase) but none the less I'll do the reagent tests and post the pics.

Finally got around to trying this trypt.  It was many things; mystical, intriguing, fascinating, beautiful, and much more.  Very forgiving on the mind/emotions and a nice, natural body high.  This was a lot more visual, than shrooms, emerging intricate geometric pattering, pastel like, ect...  I love this stuff a new favorite.

For some reasons out of all the hallucinogens, shrooms provide a difficult mindstate where it can get really dark, confusing, and frustrating. With 4-aco-mipt i had no problem with heavy fluctuations of negative and positive energies, it was positive all the way through.

got around to giving this a try over the weekend.  Took ~16mg, definitely going higher next time.  Comeup was slowed by eating pretty shortly beforehand, which is something i usually try to avoid, but sometimes its just not in the cards.  All in all really nice, gentle experience.  Next time i'm thinking 30-35mg.

4-AcO-MiPT helped me to understand the term and feel of the tryptamine experience much better. understanding the common ground between that of say mushrooms and LSD without the experience having the importance of psilocybin or LSD loom over me I was able to really tell what a true yet custom tryptamine was like! Has me wanting to experiment with many more synthetics now.

i just recevied a gram if this product soo will road test it before making it avalible to others. am more looking forward to the DPT i got aswell!


to to love psycadelics dunno if the shits legal in the UK the DPT might not be but its easy enough to get anything online only thing i cant get without risking being bumped is n n dmt. plenty 5-meo-dmt in ma stash but thats an acuired taste i find snorting it more enjoyable.

what a wonderful experience i got from ~35mg of 4-aco-mipt. very much unexpected, in that the comeup was ratehr long but the trip itself was the closest ive yet to come to synthetic mushroom experience.


T:0 - ingested ~35mg on a almost empty stomach (light dinner 2 hours previous

+30mins - nothing, not even alertness

+60min - got worried that it might be the wrong chem, or bunk or degraded in transit, but starting now music seems strangly hypnotic and captivating.

+90min - it starts to feel like a real trip. Visually there are tracers, mild breathing and morphing as far as oevs are concerned, with very interesting patterning with eyes closed. music is excellent. this is the point where one would say i hit the plateau phase.

 visually i had the impression at times that reality was bursting at the seams, with almost every edge in sight revealing a little bit of extra space, extra color behind it. sometimes surfaces would "reflect" furniture/images even though this was not possible (carpets cant reflect eh ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)). Despite these effects, i never felt confused, walking and moving around felt surefooted (though it was a solid +++). some weak weed felt very nice, as did eating some chocolate.

felt like dancing, and moving felt good. no muscle tremors, no twitching, quite relaxing despite the wave after wave of energy.

very smooth, very little headfuck, however i found it... moreish. i kept regreting i had not taken more.


that being said the whole plateu phase lasted a good 4 hours, and on the comedown some MET was added (which worked wonderfully, prolonging everything by around 1-2 hours) adding euphoria and some visuals to an already impressive night.


at t+6h i was down completly and fell into a gentle relaxing sleep. the next day no comedown, no hangover no adverse effects (except wanting to go back)


i surprized myself that i added the met in the end. i usually dont mix things on first gos but this felt right at the time, and the doses werent that high. so far this was the closest ive come to a custom synth mush, and though the naturals still are no1 for me, this is among the best rcs out there.

Thanks very much, great report... very experienced with everything... just got a gram from a vendor whose site just closed down temporarily for a makeover... think I will start with 20mg, though from your report and other tryptamine trials, that will probably be not enough.  But best start low just in case... would not want to end up naked on the front yard in the snow at 9am grinning and waving dementedly at the neighbors driving off to work, hehe.

this reminds me of a fun night on lsd, when at 6am on a monday morning i was cleaning the car (of snow) in front of my house, while humming and dancing around it while everyone was off to work, mustve looked like the happiest emploee of all


but really i think the chances of doing somehting too crazy on the stuff are quite minimal, especially at that dose.

I'd probably find 20mg to be a heavy dose; ~16mg had me tripping balls (maybe because I'm in CT benzo withdrawal). It's a very intense experience for me, a total game changer. The visuals are full-on, and oh so meaningful, wrapping themselves in to the synaesthetic maelstrom of emotional insight. The spiritual dimention to this compound is powerful, immersing you with slick efficiency into karmic awareness and an ability to see one's self in the void. I found myself in a very shroomy elf-space, being nudged around gently but sincerely by omnipresent entities. This is like a very clear and lucid shroom in many respects, but with a greater cosmic undercurrent. A very useful tool for Tantric Yoga.

20mg was very mild for me... modest but rather pleasant body buzz, did keep me awake all night, but no real visuals (perhaps slight increase in color awareness?) or headfuck to speak of.  Gentle, which is good.  Zero cardio impact at this level.  Guess I'm gonna have to try 30mg next time.  So it does seem everyone's sweet spot is unique.  Seems like its going to be along the lines of 4-aco-dipt for me... I really need at least 35-40 mg of that for anything very impressive to occur.  Everyone's neurochemical receptors, enzymes, whatever are pretty unique, so start at 15 or 20 and work your way up if you need more.  But wait at least 2-3 days before trying again... the tolerance to these tryptamines occurs very fast and strong.  Second day in a row can be effective at a slightly increased dose, but by the third day response seems halved.

Beautiful compound to me. Many layers to it. I find it maddening and exploratory. Particularly simulating to the mind inducing hypomanic to manic states in many individuals I've witnessed on this compound. A good one for artists and writers to take and venture out on a long walk.

@DwayneHoover: I'm really suprised 20mg was mild for you. I am in your dose ballpark for 4-xxx-DiPT. I wonder if I'm just particularly sensitive to this chemical - I'm pretty sensitive to shrooms, with 2g cubes enough to rock my world. Or as you say, it could be highly variable per individual.

Individual sensitivity for unknown biochemical reasons it seems.  2g shrooms are good for me, but merely "nice."  For me it really takes 3g to "rock my world" and create a totally immersive life altering trip.

Actually coming up on 10mg of Mipracetin hcl and 7mg of Miprocin hcl. Can't stress how amazing this compound is in my eyes. I know a lot of people who dislike its alien and manic nature but it puts me where I wanna be. I prefer a large dose of Mipracetin personally. Iprocin lacks the magic 4XXXmipt gives me but iprocin has its own place in my book. Miprocin/cetin reminds me more of mushrooms than P.cetin. As strange as that sounds. Its hard for me to believe the acetoxy analogues don't have unique metabolites to speak of. Especially to account for an extended duration. Sure the dose is more but still. I'd be interested in sampling 5-ho-mipt and 5-aco-mipt to see how those effects differ. The 4, 5 position is unique in tryptamines and I find it hard to believe that material is fully hydroxylated with how much effects seem to differ between 4-ho's and 4-aco's. Its only theoretical of course that aco's are fully metabolized into their hydroxyl cousins.. There are disputes as to whether or not psilocybin takes a synergistic role in a mushroom experience along with psilocin/ baeocystin/ ect.  visuals are beginning letters melting/shifting into one another. Bout to hop off the computer its a lame place to trip to me.

I don't know about 5-HO-MiPT. Bufotenin seems to be faily toxic to the body in high doses, so 'miprotenin' might be like moxy's toxic cousin. Perhaps "toxy"? :D Or that might just be highly judgemental nonsense!


I like moxy as it is, but I'm sure someone will come up the hydroxy analogues of all the 5-MeO-trypts at some point.


As for miprocetin and it's hydroxy counterpart, it seems that most anecdotal reports would put these compounds quite close together in their effects; I could easily confuse someone's description of the miprocin space with that of my own miprocetin experience. But then I'm sure they do have subtle differences that can by teased apart by conoissuers familiar with both compounds, and I would like to think that there's extra ground to be explored. 


I know exactly what you mean about miprocetin being closer to shrooms than other 4-subbed tryps. However, there are elements of the experience that set it apart and make it a very worthwhile tryptamine in it's own right.

I don't get to much visual activity on the MiPT chems. But I must say that 4-AcO-MiPT is one of the most euphoric tryptamines I've ever tried. I was running around the beach doing cartwheels like I was 5 again and falling to the floor in gut busting laughter at everything. I also had some amazing sex a couple times while I was on it. Overall its one of my favorite tryptamines even though its not to visual for me.

Until i got to doses in the 30mg range i didn't have just a whole lot of visual effects.  Certainly altered vision, but not terribly so.  At higher doses there were definitely a lot of visuals, but they were different from the visual effects of the lower homologues.  I've got weird theory about alkyl chain length & edge detection, ha

The mix was really interesting. Much more close eyed imagery and very visual. I'd like to take more Miprocin on 20mg of Mipracetin next time. I'd like to hear about this weird theory=)!


lol wouldn't embark on some high "toxy" doses. Some lab studies would be very beneficial down the road I think with 5 hydroxy/acetoxy tryptamines. To correct my thought stated previously going straight to bioassay would be irresponsible and mad. 5-Ho-AMT sounds more toxic than Bufotentin. Miprotentin may be worthless. But on the contrary Serotonin is 5-HT which we all know how important that compound is to the human body/mind. 5-HTP... over the counter.. then there's N-Acetylserotonin. There's no way of telling whether or not there's a psychedelic 5-HO tryptamine can be made that isn't a toxic waste of time to make. 5-HO-AMT sounds like a very poor example.


 If i'm after visuals I'll just take 2C-E or P. The MiPT family seems particularly special and intriguing to me. Can't wait to give Moxy a whirl.

It happens. Its very rare but I've seen it with my own eyes. BUT did you get a freebase form of it? That should explain the oral inactivity (correct me if I'm wrong anyone). Try smoking 5mg to start. I have no experience with smoking 4-substituted tryptamines so I can't say it won't destroy the material but others say it works. If its fumerate or hcl salt then its possible that you're a rare case where a particular psych does nothing.

I've tried it many times, in doses from 10 to perhaps 50 mgs. The sweet spot for me seems to be around 20-25 mgs. It's very similar to mushrooms or any of the psilocin analogs. Among the more potent mg for mg of these, and the more visual. The report in Tihkal that it (or was it 4ho-mipt?) is twice as potent as psilocin is an exageration however.


I'm sure this would get more responces in PD.

doesn't really matter if you're eyeballing ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) especially a chemical you've never seen before.  different powders have different densities, you really can't know how much you've been taking yada yada yada, bad idea, get a scale, they're like $30


as far as potency is concerned, its roughly equipotent with psilacetin.  but you should definitely start low & work your way up with any new substance.

Had a wonderful journey with this chemical yesterday. I must say i was rather surprized by the fact it took less substance to take me farther than previously. 


This was my second attempt with the substance, ~28mg. The comeup was rather anxious, but after ~1h it really got into gear, giving me a beautiful ~2h or tripping time with some of the most amazing OE visuals ive seen, along with synesthesia and music appreciation through the roof. there was also great energy felt throught, dancing seemed inevitable and was very pleasurable. these all persisted thought the whole 5h experience (though the last 3 h in an decreasing manner), with some lingering aftereffects (good vibes, happiness) present the day after.


really curious though why it took less this time. might be the empty stomach, might be that my mind was better rested, or maybe i just lost some chem last time from scale to mouth, who knows, im just thankful for the experience

fumarate is pretty stable, haven't combined it with anything yet thus far, but i'd imagine it would be similar to other 4-sub-tryptamines in as far as getting along with other substances

How long would fumarate 4-AcO-MiPT last without loosing its potency in some dark room temperature place? 2c-* seems to be very stable and can last very long, but usually tryptamines seems to be unstable, loosing potency over time.


Also would 30mg fumarate be good dose, without the "damn I should have taken more" feeling.

If you store it properly it should last a long time, even at roomtemp.  

Keep it as dry and sealed up from enviormental exposure as possible.

30mg should be enough for  solid trip.

Hey!


Since i don't see any informations about the dosage on Erowid, i would like to know if 10mg will be active ? I had a sample of 30mg 4-AcO-MIPT Fumarate ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

i found it to be subjectively somewhat less potent than 4-HO-MET by weight, which makes sense as its molecular weight is a bit higher as well.  Think my first trial with it was around 15-20mg and certainly active at that level, but not overwhelming or all that impressive.  Started to get much more interesting around 30-35mg, been a while since i've had an opportunity to do any further trials with it though.  As always though, YMMV.  I'd think 10-15mg would be a good starting point for most people, after lower dose allergy tests of course.

^ you could go 10mg and in an hour do 10mg more if you want to test the waters or you could just do 15mg and probably have a good time on it. 10mg might not be what you want as by looking at your last posts you may have a bit of a tolerance building up.


4-ACO-MIPT is a bit of both mental/visual for me. Bodyload isn't bad after the come up but the come up can be a little rough (bit of anxiety, nausea, and feeling uncomfortable).

well YMMV as always, but 10mg is pretty subtle for most people.  I found mipracetin to be somewhat "quiet in the head" and almost sedating; very easy to get into meditative states with it.  Visually i found it unimpressive until i got to about 25-30mg, getting really interesting at +30mg.  I found the visuals to have a bit different character than other 4-sub-trypts, save maybe 4-HO-MiPT.  I think the lengthy alkyl chain on the isopropylated tryptamines may have some different effects on edge detection than the lower homologues.

just read a few pages back...


anyway, in a nutshell, the bodyload is rather mild, and it is a very easy substance to tolerate, and not too confusing.

how strong? well it really depends on what you mean by strong, doesnt it. like anymajordude said before, it is visual at rather higer doses ~20-30mg, and a lot less so at <15mg. 10mg is for me at least a threshold dose (but perhaps i do have a slight tolerance). music appreciation is greatly enhanced.


YMMV. go for an allergy dose first and move on from there. some report good result with upping the dose in the first hour. id rather be tripping twice. it is a very nice chemical even at low doses

**CAUTION**


Yesterday at the tail end of 4-ACO-DMT dosed about 10mg of 4-ACO-MIPT. *This shit raised my bloodpressure, caused seriousvasoconstriction and what really worried me was the inflammatory reaction in my heart and pancreas, it felt like burning and swelled.......* it could be immunological reaction to some infection cause i was yesterday bitten by a cat, but its hard to say. besides that had very devilish thoughts, really bad and negative, the type of stuff u really shouldn't have in any psy(see below for info about general effects).

 It also could be from mixing with 4-ACO-DMT, another time also had a bad reaction with mixing 4-HO-MET although alone was fine.


I need further testing, but with this bodyload or potential to trigger it, have very mixed feelings about this compound. Be safe.


______


On more a light note,  what I liked in this tryptamine was the analytical, focused, energetic, and awesome music experience. Its a audiophile dream, being able to dissect so perfectly all the instruments of the music, and listen to the tone/pitch so closely, makes u feel like an audio expert, and very immersed and distracted, seems perfect for a concert or even for partying. Its like this 30% LSD / 70% Shrooms, with a amphetamine edge, very awake and active. Visually it was similar to LSD, not particulary interesting besides having an hallucination that normally only reach in very high doses of LSD - seeing the bones of my hand lighten up like its an alien creature, cool! lol  Introspectively if I disconnected from the music (saved me eheh), started to had psychopath / maniac thoughts  in devilish nature, not about myself, but about others.. At some point also felt quiet paranoid with the pics in my room that had eyes were watching me.  Like I said also had a bad reaction with mixing 4-ACO-DMT and 4-HO-MET, it seems 4-ACO-DMT competes with other tryptamines to end in a negative mindset.

woo, dude, sorry you had a bad time... but i will say theres no way to be sure the rc gave you those symptoms....

heart and pancreas? inflammatory reaction?... i really doubt that was the case, especially when you describe it as swelled and buring. more likely just some stomach issues (the heart doest hurt like that, and pancreatic troubles ... well they hurt like hell but dont go away so easily). it is waaay more likely to be something related to the cat bite or god knows what.


just try this substance on its own. it really is a gem, even if, like you said, can get a bit manic at times. and some might consider getting visuals compared to a strong lsd dose from 10mg of substance to be a good thing (and interesting too) ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Unfortunaley this tryptamine might not be for me..This crap gave me almost the very first panic attack on psychedelics - fucking INTENSE headache, fever (so much had cool down with a swooped towel  aroundh my head), burning sensation that switched from stomatch to later to my chest, and high BPM :/ I tried to hold this for about 1h45, and see if it would progress positively but the chest burning was getting too much, there's no drug worthy this hassle, so used the last 0.5mg alprazolam w/ minimal effect on fever/headaches, but reduced the burning sensation about 80%.  I think my biosystem went nuts and reacted like was some virus or infection. I definitely advise proceed with caution with this one, there's more people reporting strange bodyload.

dude! im so sorry to hear about your experience! it certanly is among the most extreme ive heard... perhaps this chem just isnt for your body, it might also be a physiological reaction to it... im curious, was the fever just felt or did you manage to get your temperature read? im still leaning to think this is more of a combination of factors leading to unforuntate results but who knows for sure right?

if you have friends with the same batch you might consider warning them...

For me, a big part of getting a scale was moving out of my parents place.  Getting a big box doesn't go unnoticed.  An envelope, no one asks questions.


That being said, I just waited my turn to mess with these chemicals.  Except for bromo-dragonfly, but that was in solution.

Oh, I actually had questions about this chem.  Is it still as hygroscopic as that first batch mentioned at the start of this thread.  I don't particularly want to work with goop/sap.  Also, how does this feel compared to 5-meo-mipt?

Wow old thread.  This stuff still is nothing like 4-Ho-MiPT.  Whoever said they are interchangable....they aren't.  This is one of the few 4-substituted tryptamines (along with 4-AcO-DMT and 4-Ho-DiPT) that was different/unique enough from old fashioned psilocybin mushrooms to warrent actually taking it more than once or twice.  8 years later I still feel the same.


PS to the above person who asked about it being hygroscopic...I am aware of subsequent bathes that WERE NOT hygroscopic but no idea what is out there today.


5-MeO-MiPT seemed to resemble 5-MeO-DMT more than anything (when smoked) but I only tried that one once or twice.  5-MeO-MiPT seemed more body oriented vs visionary.  4-AcO-MiPT is just delicious gourmet stuff.  4-Ho-MiPT....cool and VERY colorful but just lacks something.  No idea why the acetoxy changes the effects so much.

After the train wreck where  Ialmost had the very first panic attack in my life,  fever-like symptoms, and other extremely negative bodyload (more detailed on a reply on top). I have noticed this trigged some social anxiety, perhaps this was already latent, but I'm not sure. It also decreased my ability to "let go", that had learned before with other psychedelics. Obviously I decided to do nice break, and been 3 weeks without psychedelics, objective beingfor 6 weeks...


 Now im wondering,  should i try a low dose with this psychedelic to make peace with it? Or  focus on this issue with another   psychedelic  that im at ease (like 4-aco-dmt)?

Well I had last weekend a 10mg experience (divided into 5mg 30mn apart, with some bread eaten)  without  almost no side-effects. I think the reason is that crosses too quickly BBB frying my brain? lol I heard about this approach of spreading a dose over small doses in a period of time to reduce side-effects (e.g. nausea) from other thread.

Here's my two cents, i tried it this morning with my girlfriend, 16mg for her and 28 for me, this one have a very fast come up within ten minutes i had slight oev, but nothing crazy. Physically we both had shivers and goosebumps and had to throw up. It was quite harsh on the body and i did not found nothing erotic at the come up at all since my balls shrinked as never. 


After a shower, i felt slightly better, but as some one said previously a little bit dumb, with difficulties in every day tasks, but with a very giggly mood. 


I would not take more of it because the come up was too harsh for the final effects not so overwhelming. It may be fun if you dont have much time and a solid stomach.

It was always a super benign fun house ride for me! I've really really been pondering grabbing more for the longest time....! I am always effected oddly by 4-subs as well but this one was just a gentle nice ride on down the creek throughout.

I've been watching this thread for some time now and finally just got around to creating a Bluelight account..


I am very interested in this compound. I decided to invest into 4-AcO-DMT and a -MiPT but I have yet to see any real direct comparisons of 4-AcO-MiPT to 4-HO-MiPT. Many have said that the Acetoxy and Hydroxy of DiPT were "interchangeable" and I've found comparisons of this compound to a slew of others, just not its 4-HO-..although I'm having a difficult time finding a source for the 4ace I figure I should get some more information on the two before I buy like 100g of anything.

I appreciate it.

i was taking 4-ho-mipt earlier on in the year taking 50mg doses and that was great and giving me amazing experiences. then i switched to 4-aco-dmt for couple of months. but now that ive gone back to 4-ho-mipt, 50mg is hardly doing anything. whats the deal? have i build up some kind of tolerance?

How often did you trip? 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT sounds like a very high dose, if it is comparable to 4-AcO-MiPT.

That is insanely high.  I found 12-14mg plenty for full immersion.

I have stored 4-AcO-MiPT for almost 2 years in the freezer. It is a truly wonderful compound and I am considering a new experience. It looks normal, but after this time there is quite a chance of degradation or loss in potency, right?

If I had to venture a guess, I'd say probably not.  It was in the freezer and I assume kept airtight?  If it looks good then I think it should be fine and I wouldn't think degraded beyond maybe a tiny bit.

I haven't tried either the hydroxy or acetoxy of MiPT, but from my experience with a lot of different tryptamines, the two are likely not interchangeable.  The AcO esters are mostly quite different from their HO counterparts, although of course there are commonalities.

In that case I need to reconsider my plan.  My previous experiences were with ~22mg and ~21mg, which I both would settle in a upper-medium dosage.

I would like to take it a bit further. Some reports make me think that a range from 25mg to 30mg should do the trick.

If the time is right, given these beautiful spring days, I will test it out. Thanks!


And yes: light, but not as "mellow" as 4-HO-MET in my experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have only had the 5-Meo, and it's the best of the 5-MeOs by far in my opinion, at least that I've had.  Super light and thought, crisp clarity, absolutely no body awkwardness whatsoever.

Well, I have to admit that the body awkwardness (![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)) can be an irritating thing. Moving my limbs, dancing or making repetitive moves with a weird - yet confident - smile on my face helps a lot %)

The 5-MeOs are uncharted territory for me. Maybe someday I will get the opportunity and then I will embrace it with respectful joy, hahaha.

I don't find any of them to be nearly as good as the MiPT one.  I am excited to try the AcO and HO because of it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  5-MeO-MiPT is very possibly the cleanest feeling psychedelic there is, for me.

Right? I was actually going to say that. I think thirty milligrams would be good, that was my go to higher end dose for using it alone. I think this one really shines in combos as well, seems to add a lot of things, and a good amount of general merriment.

I will keep in mind, that 5-MeO-MiPT might be the one I want. Take care with the 4-sub-MiPTs and expect a little discomfort. But it will fade eventually and then it is up to you what you make of it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I know a few combos that went well for me. I know I've combined it at varying quantities with 2c-B, DOC, MDMA, MXE,  ketamine, 3-MeO-PCP, 4-HO-MET, and DMT. Not all at once but some of those were also combined together with 4-AcO-MiPT. All them worked well but I love combos so....![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I revisited this... last week...WOW

 Bought it during the time of when; 4-ho-mipt turned to goo, mine turned to a dark gravely powder.. My AC0-mipt went from white to brown too. That was about 5 years ago.


My 4-Ho did indeed become very week... But My 4-AC0 at 25mg kicked my but in a nice way... 


They where both stored in amber bottles in a cool place... so what gives? why would one go bad and the other not... 


Well, I also tried (recently) a new batch of  the Furmate 4-ho Mipt... and i loved it too... @ 25mg

I think i like the older AC0 better... The floors where moving a whole lot and lots of blues and purples with hints of red... and a really good vibe to it...

20 mg is a dose that will make me feel good but I prefer a heavy dose of 35 or a little more mixed with mox or the 4ho MET. I have a friend who mixed up two baggies and instead of eating 10 mg moxy he ate 100 Mg of 4 ho mipt. he dindnt even realize until why he was tripping so hard until I told him he ate the wrong bag. some people man..... how do you mix 10 mg with 100???

Oh, but anyways the guy was totally fine he was just sitting in his camping chair tripping balls for a couple hours before he was comfortable to move around. he was the first one up that morning and started a fire and cooked breakfast so in my opinion one could eat a A LOT  of 4ho mipt.

I've started getting into higher doses of tryptamines too... I used to go for the 20-25mg level with 4-sub-Ts, but lately I've been going more like 35-40mg.

As I understand it, the hydroxy esters tend to be less stable than the acetoxy ones.

I keep mine stored well... frozen -2 in argon gas... I have a batch of fur-mate too.. The HO went bad but the ACO did not.. i did use the ho allot and more often.. I just got back into the aco.. i have not touched it in years... I don't party like i did with people 10 plus years ago.. So.. so it seen the less it is exposed to air and moister the better... there is little to no humility here...

You should have at least a little humility or they'll go bad soon enough.


Seriously though, when you say, "the HO went bad," I assume you mean in non-ideal conditions as opposed to your frozen argon wonderland? I would assume that, kept frozen, any of these chemicals would last forever...

I cant believe the last post was two years ago?!... 


I have just tried this substance at 20mg a few days ago and I fell in love with it instantly! I have posted the same info in another thread about 4-subbed trypts comparison but I want to revive this thread as well! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


4-Aco-MiPT started a lot quicker and  smoother than it's 4-HO counterpart and it developed into a very  beautiful, energetic and highly visual state with no body load  whatsoever!

On the same dose of 4-HO-MiPT my stomach would be pretty upset and I'd  get strong chest compression. The trip is somewhat similar to 4-HO, but I  liked 4-Aco a lot better because it was less hectic and a lot more  manageable with pretty strong OEVs and CEVs. 


But the best part is how strong physically, mentally and spiritually it  made me feel, I felt very empowered, like there's no one and nothing  that could have shaken me down from that state. I sat there meditating  for couple of hours with the singing bowl and felt the perfection in  every imperfection of my body, of my thought process, of the whole  reality - it was really beautiful. I also felt strong sexual desire  enhancement but unfortunately didn't have my GF nearby to test the  erotic stuff, I bet it would be amazing! 8) 

 The afterglow was amazing and lasted two days after the trip, strangely my eyes  became a lot lighter in color and brighter after the trip and for the  whole afterglow duration (I've had it happened on LSD many times) ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)


All in all, I can't recommend this substance enough, that's how good it was to me! %)

In my estimation, 4-AcO-MiPT is superior (albeit not by much) to its HO variant.

From today's journal entry:


A few days ago, I took a small dose (~2-3 mg) of 4-AcO-MiPT fumarate, mostly for the purpose of testing a new bag. But, I ended up having a shockingly blissful and insightful quasi-trip on the material, which was strong enough to betray the methyl-isopropyl signature. [...] Ever since that day, I have been stimulated, inspired, and somehow more focused. The world seems more colorful. I've also noticed something which often happens when I'm feeling particularly euphoric and energized, and which I just love: sights and sounds from the world around me evoke, by some tangential association, fond memories of positive experiences from my distant past, reaching all the way back to the earliest memories of my childhood.​

Now I'm contemplating to combine both 4-AcO-MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT together to see if they compliment each other or rather make it uncomfortable, thinking of 12-15mg of 4-AcO with 10mg of 4-HO...8)

They don't in my experience. Just take either, they're both pretty much the same anyway. If you want synergy, try a low dissociative dose on top of the psychedelic.

We trialed this for the first time tonight at 40mg and noticed that it seems much less potent than the HO version.

40mg of 4-HO-MiPT would had me tripping hard but I felt like I should have taken probably 60mg or so which I think would be roughly equivalent to 40mg 4-HO-MiPT.

I also found the AcO version to be less stimulating and much longer lasting which is to be expected over the HO version.

I'll have to try a higher dose next time for a better comparison but I feel like I prefer the HO version at this point. 

Also, as an interesting side note 4-HO-MIPT induced a sort of urethritis (which bordered on itching to orgasms) in several female testers but this was not noticed at all on 4-AcO-MiPT.

Interesting observation about females urethritis and 4-HO-MiPT, now I recall my girl saying something about feeling itchy horny while on it...8)


I find 4-AcO-MiPT to be more LSD-like and 4-HO-MiPT to be more mushroom-like, if it makes any sense at all. 8![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png))  So 4-AcO-MiPT feels like its more stimulating to me, contrary with your findings. Differences in metabolism?.. 


Did you notice an afterglow with 4-AcO one? I felt it much stronger than with 4-HO and it was very cleansing feeling, like a shower for the soul...:D

I find it fascinating that you use the metaphor of bathing to describe 4-AcO-MiPT, because just yesterday I described it to a friend as "bathing in a crystalline freshwater mountain stream".


After taking this drug again on Saturday at 14 mg, I think I've concluded that this is my all-time favorite psychedelic, period.

4-AcO-MiPT - electric airy version of Miprocin! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

It is very good indeed, found it to go extremely nice with Proscaline - Only 20mg of P with about 15mg of 4-AcO-MiPT results in complex CEVs, greatly increased music appreciation and a sense of being in a God's kingdom for few hours. Great stuff! :D

Would it be safe to say that at lower doses (8 to 20mg) this chemical leans much closer to a fun, bright, almost MDMA feeling than a heavy, mind altering experience?

That's been my experience for sure.  Or even at higher dosages, though it gets heavier, it still has the same general character.

Hey so I want thoughts I just saw a post saying bluelight kills that made good points about how they do save lives but also indirectly promote the use of rcs and other dangerous substances that some people wouldnt have been exposed to if it hadnt been for this website anyone got thoughts on this and also this is kind of controversial plz dont ban me mods im just curious

An interesting question.  We've had criticism before, both from frightened/angry parents of kids who died or got into trouble with drugs who were on Bluelight, and also from a group of disgruntled people in the recent past who were mad about getting banned and decided to try to undermine us.  The fact is, you can find out about this stuff everywhere now.  Reddit, one of the most visible and visited sites on the planet, has way more talk about RCs than we do, and it's largely much less regulated and tempered with experienced advice than it is here.  We believe here that suppressing talk about these things is more harmful than talking about them and dispensing good information.  If you found out about certain drugs at Bluelight, you could have also found out about them in a random google search from reddit, or drugs-forum, or other sources.  If we did not then allow discussion about how to use them safely, people would still do the drugs, but they wouldn't be able to talk to anyone about how to safely use them.  It can be tempting, for frightened parents or people who tried drugs and developed problems, to blame someone, but I don't think blaming a place that is trying to help people be safer is the way to go.


Any time you talk about drugs, you indirectly promote their use, if you think about it that way... if no one on the Internet talked about them, most people wouldn't know they exist.  But people do know they exist, so there needs to be a resource that people can use to learn what they can about these substances before using them.

The age old question that's stupider then fuck. Do we just let people die and not give them the essential information that we have because it might cause more to use even though regardless more will use....? Or do we save lives? This question is so simple it's not even funny to me. Of course we save lives. If people die anyways I'll work my whole life to save the few I can. I'm not a monster. I don't hide in ignorance and I do what I can to help those I can. This world is dominated by Darwinism. Some live some die but at the end we all die anyways. The sad truth is you can't save everyone but I'd rather save a few then save none...

^ 100% on your description. I'm *quite *excited  about what you said about mipracetin and proscaline. I have a friend  that raves about miprocin and mescaline, which is a combination that  seems to me like it would almost make sense, but not quite. Mipracetin  and proscaline, both lighter and less serious than their relatives, seem  like a cleaner, more natural fit for wholesome, heartwarming hedonism.  Sad that proscaline and MAL disappeared so quickly (they seemed nice,)  while allylescaline and escaline lingered (they sounded forgettable.)

I'm a bad judge of 4-HO-MiPT, a  molecule that is magical for everyone but me, it seems. I really want to  like it, and apart from the higher-than-average incidence of minor  side-effects, I love it until the tail of the experience arrives. This  is true regardless of dose. I find lighter doses are often not light and  stronger doses are often not strong, but as a rule for me 8-12mg is  light and 16-18mg is common. Some of my acquaintances need higher doses.  


I explored 4-AcO-MiPT in the hope that it would have less of  the weirdness of 4-HO-MiPT while retaining what I like about it (sensory  enhancement, emotional enhancement, appetite enhancement, narrative  engagement, etc.) It did and it didn't. It's light and electric,  empathogenic and enhancing, but it doesn't have the deep level of  full-throated engagement that 4-HO-MiPT had for me, where I get sucked  into every activity with total enthusiasm and appreciation (the primal  quality that I talk about with it.) I can take it or leave it, which  kind of defeats the purpose for me...and I still get a hint of the weird  creepiness that 4-HO-MiPT brought. 


5-MeO-MiPT has none of the  weirdness of the 4-subs for me, but it's a different experience. While  clearly in the same family, the headspace is generally lighter at lower  doses, and far less productive or threatening. It's probably my favorite  recreational material, and one that enriches my life in tangential  ways, but at common doses it lacks a lot of attributes conventionally  associated with psychedelics. 


MiPT itself is a hard one to  characterize. I find it to be the lightest of the bunch. Vaporized, it  doesn't do a lot for me. Shadowmeister mentioned that about DET, and for  me the same is true of MiPT. Oral doses are the richest and most  rewarding, but they have been light and use a lot of material. Rectal  (and to some extent insufflated) have been pretty good, as well, but  still quite light. While light, it retains a lot of the empathy and  emotional richness of its relatives, generally adding a sultry sparkle  to a few hours of the day, obliterating negative states of mind and  allowing me to attend to the present in a way that is enjoyable (but not  especially productive or therapeutic in my experience.) I really need  to explore this material more to see if this characterization holds  true, but I haven't had the opportunity as EPT and its sweet nothings  have proven more charming. I had hoped that MiPT vaporization would be  great, but like Shadowmeister mentioned about DET, I find it simply  stoning and uninteresting.

I mentioned it about MPT actually, I've nerver tried DET but reports make DET sound quite powerful.


I had a subtle yet very powerful experience on vaporized MPT, very meaningful to me (was able to see my fried who ODd and died as she was before the end and say I was sorry and forgive her), yet I was not tripping too hard... the next time I tried it it was just pleasant and very subtle.

I was extremely lucky to actually have some of this arrive at my house. Shocking, considering I was extremely naive and actually ordered it from a clear web site using only google pay. After 2 weeks and no feedback from the company, I figured they had just taken my scratch. And i deserved it. But shockingly, it actually came. Light brown color.


Now that it's here, i have several questions. No problems if these are too "noob-ish", and if so, they can be deleted by whoever does that sort of thing.


But, here we go.


1st) How do you guys measure your dose? I have a scale that goes to the hundredth decimal, but that's it. So, it'll be risky. I'll be able to tell if I'm taking between 10mg and 20 mg. But not the exact amount. I have 250mg. So do you just pour it all out and try to weigh lines of it?


2nd) How do you take it? Do you mix it with alcohol and just throw it back? Do you parachute it? You don't snort it, do you?


Again, apologies for the extremely elementary questions. But psychedelic substances, as we all know, are scary. I'll risk looking like a dummy in order to make sure me and my friends have a good time and don't spend 4 hours losing our shit.


Thanks for any tips, guys. Truly! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

(1) Invest in a milligram scale (.001).  They cost the same (roughly) as the .1 and .01 scales.  You can get one on amazon or ebay for like $25, on amazon you can have it in 2 days (if you have prime anyway).  Absolutely no excuse to not get one, your scale is not going to cut it if you're dealing with research chemicals.  


If you had a phenethylamine (like 2C-B or something) you would be able to dissolve the whole amount in some vodka or similar alcohol, say 250mg in 250mL of liquid, and then you could use an oral syringe (you can get them for free or buy slightly nicer ones at a pharmacy, they're just used to measure liquid medicines) to accurately dose yourself without a scale... you would know that each mL of liquid contained 1mg of the chemical.  Of course, you have to weigh the total amount first to make sure they sent you the right amount, you can't assume they did (I've had places send me twice as much as I paid for before).  Your scale would probably work fine for that, because if it was off by 10mg, that error would be divided across all the doses so you'd still be pretty accurate with liquid measurement.  HOWEVER, with tryptamines (like 4-AcO-MiPT), you shouldn't store them in liquid because they break down rapidly (unlike phenethylamines which will last a long time in stored in a cold environment in liquid).  So this method won't work in your case (but it's good to know about if you end up getting some other thing, especially very potent things where even a milligram scale can be too inaccurate).


Do NOT eyeball it/try to divide it into lines, 2 piles of powder that weigh the same can look quite different especially if the powder is fluffy.  There's no good way to do this, especially if you're new to this sort of thing (but really, no one should ever eyeball, it's irresponsible).


I wanted to give you some general information since it's important to learn, but what you need to do is order a .001 scale, that way you'll be safe.  


(2) Don't snort it, I mean you can, but the effects are better orally.  I just put the powder in my mouth and swallow but some people can't bear the taste, so yeah, you can mix it in liquid and chug it down (it won't break down that quickly, it breaks down over the course of days/weeks/months), or put it in a gel cap, or parachute it.  However you feel is best to get it down.


Enjoy!  4-AcO-MiPT is a great substance, one of my faves.  Please come back with any other questions you have. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thank you so much, man. I will definitely invest in a sufficient scale.


Another question, though; How do you get it out of the bag? Dealing with such small amounts, do you use one of those "coke spoons"? A popsicle stick? Do you just pat the bag until your desired amount falls out?


Update: Bought the scale.

I usually use a tiny spoon, or tap the bag til it comes out.  Some will end up getting stuck to the sides of the bags at the end, and to get that you can rinse it out some alcohol and then evaporate it on some glass and scrape it up.

I have exactly one experience with 4-HO-MiPT, many more experiences will follow in the next 10 years. Can I expect 4-HO-MiPT to be totally similiar (i.e. indistinguishable) from 4-AcO-MiPT, because this is a prodrug to 4-HO-MiPT?

I don't have direct experience with the 4-x-MiPTs but I believe the general consensus is they are not the same. At the very least, pharmacokinetics are different (because of the additional metabolism step I presume), meaning that people frequently report the 4-AcO-xxTs as feeling "smoother" and perhaps lasting a little bit longer. There's a [short but high quality thread](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/821886-4-subbed-Tryptamines-Acetoxy-VS-Hydroxy-Subjective-general-differences) about comparisons between them, actually.

It seems like some people find the 4-AcO and 4-HO tryptamines to be indistinguishable, but most find at least some differences, with some people finding them distinct enough to be able to tell apart in a blind test.  My belief is that it has to do with individual metabolic factors, and that the 4-AcO is broken down in vivo to its corresponding 4-HO, but that the 4-AcO itself is also able to pass the BBB, so that the differences in the way people react to them is based on how quickly they break it down.


For me, I find that the 4-AcO is different, it lasts a little longer and is smoother/more sparkly.  The difference seems to be greatest with 4-AcO/HO-DMT for me, as I find those to be very different drugs (and I've tried pure 4-HO-DMT a few times).


But yeah they at least have a lot of similarities.  I find 4-HO-MiPT and 4-ACO-MiPT to be quite similar.

You think 8 to 10 mg is a good starter dose? We ain't looking to do deep. Just have a little fun.


Update: Went with 5mg. What a bitch to weigh out. Good luck to myself!

You certainly won't go too deep at that dose.  Couldn't hurt, better to dip your toes in first than jump into the deep end.

So, me and 2 friends ended up taking 5mg a piece.


I would compare more to a 1/2 hit of normal, 100 ug acid (so 50 ug) but it was much, much cleaner than a 1/2 hit usually is. I love doing a 1/2 hit. But it usually comes with all the bad things about LSD and only some of the good things. This shit was cleeeeeean. So clean. We weren't tripping, probably even "tripping" less than you would on a 1/2 hit. But it was way better. No visuals, CE or OE, but lots of euphoria and the feeling of being simultaneously the smartest and dumbest I've ever felt. Which is one of my favorite parts about psych's. I have a sight headache now, but I'm not willing to blame this stuff for it.


Overall, very enjoyable and will almost certainly double the dose to 10 to 12mg's and I expect to have a hell of night.


PS: Absolute pain in the ass to weigh that small of an amount out. Probably wasted 1 or 2mg's on it simply sticking to the tip of the knife or whatever utensil I was using to get it out. Also, boy does it taste terrible. Especially when you just lick it off a little sticky note like i did.

Nice, I'm glad you enjoyed it.  My favorite dose is around 30mg.  I'm a bit of a hardhead, but I bet you'll like it a lot more at a higher dose.  If 5mg did something substantial for you, you're likely very sensitive to make sure to work up slowly.

Yeah, I trip a lot, but I almost always do smaller doses. Always between 1.75 to 3.5g of mushroom and almost always 1 hit of normal, street grade LSD (Although once, we got our hands on some super powerful stuff. That was a great night). I use these drugs strictly recreationally. I've had a big, life altering ego death and I wouldn't trade it for the world, but I'm fine if it never happens again. I just want to laugh my face off and have a great time with my friends.


I think 10-15 mg's for myself would be the sweet spot. Where I'm actually tripping but I'm not at the point of no return. But who knows, this stuff seems so friendly. 20mg's might not be out of the question!

For me 30mg is a fun night with friends, a strong trip but purely recreational.  This particular substance is highly recreational, it has a lot more euphoria and laughter to it than most tryptamines.

What would you consider a recreational dose of LSD or Mushrooms for yourself? 


I honestly need to up my LSD dose. 1 hit just doesn't have the magic anymore. It's still fun, but I'm a little too used to it.

LSD - 125-250ug (but I generally use ALD-52 which is slightly smoother, but I know the dose for sure - it's 2 hits, but it's rare to find street hits as strong as 125ug), or mushrooms... up to 3.5 grams.  Mushrooms produce a lot more anxiety, or at least they're much more prone to it, than 4-AcO-MiPT or LSD.

Wow, you ARE a little bit of a hardhead with this one. That's how I am with 4-AcO-MET, but I'm much more sensitive to 4-AcO-MiPT. With 4-HO-MiPT, I've had a ++ off of 9mg and 12mg, and a strong ++ from 17-18mg. 22mg is a +++ for me, if I remember correctly. With 4-AcO-MiPT, the experience is noticeably lighter, and it seems like maybe 15% less potent, but lasts longer. Most of my friends preferred 4-AcO, but haven't found it necessary to up the dose to account for the lower potency. Sadly, neither of them play well with my receptors, but I decidedly prefer the 4-AcO. If I wanted a light experience these days, I'd probably take 12-14mg, and if I wanted a common experience, I'd probably take 17-21mg.


I can see why you'd like dosing higher with this one. The euphoria and positivity of the space on top of the space are just so pleasurable. My friend compares the space to being "super stoned," although that analogy doesn't resonate for me.

Well when I mentioned doses, they're doses of 4-HO-MiPT, not the AcO.  I actually have a small bit of the Aco but haven't had the opportunity to try it yet.  But yeah, 25-30mg is where I like with 4-HO-MiPT, 20mg is a little low for my tastes.  Still enjoyable but a bit generic.  I prefer taking it with friends.  At that dose, the next day our faces will hurt and maybe even our abs from so much laughter, and we spend the evening engaging in wordplay and music and stories and philosophical conversations.

Mushrooms produce a lot more anxiety, or at least they're much more prone to it, than 4-AcO-MiPT or LSD.

Agree on the mushrooms. I love them to death, but there are times where my heart starts racing and I think "You better watch something funny or listen to something happy or you're in for a long night."

My belief is that it has to do with individual metabolic factors, and that the 4-AcO is broken down in vivo to its corresponding 4-HO, but that the 4-AcO itself is also able to pass the BBB, so that the differences in the way people react to them is based on how quickly they break it down.

So, if I understand you correctly, the Pharmacokinetics is different (at least a bit), but the Pharmacodynamics is identical? Do you think that 4-AcO-substituted tryptamines directly dock on some brain receptors, or only their 4-HO-counterparts do?


My dose for 4-HO-MiPT was 20 mg last time, and it gave me a quite profound experience. I thought that it induced more neogen colors than Psilocybn-containing mushrooms do, but maybe this was just caused because of my Set. The next time I try it, I will increase the dose to 25-30 mg.

I think they both are able to directly dock in brain receptors, but that some people aren't able to experience their unique effects very much because they convert it to the hydroxy nearly completely before it has a chance.  BUT, this is my theory, I wouldn't take it as fact.  It explains the differences in peoples' experiences, though.  For me and others I've talked to, 4-AcO-DMT begins exactly like an oral smoked DMT experience... it has that same high-frequecncy buzzing, same sort of mind state, same style of visuals... then after the peak it feels almost exactly like mushrooms.  But for some people, they report it being indistinguishable from mushrooms.

This is exciting to me! I already have 4-AcO-DMT in my collection, but never taken it. This makes me eager to make it the next 4-substituted tryptamine to try. What I know from oral communication by a fellow psychonaut from my town: if one has experienced the machine elves from smoking DMT, they also appear after eating Psilocybin-containing mushrooms. Unfortunately, I have never met entities while being on tryptamines yet, but, very recently while on a high dose of 3-HO-PCP.

Currently in the midst (4 hours in) of a 10mg dose. As are 3 of my friends.


Still an absolute pain in the ass to weigh out. Partly because it's such a small dose and partly because my scale, while seemingly accurate, is also a pain in the ass.


Decided to drive about a half an hour over the mountain for a hike. Bad idea. Anyone that lives around mountains knows that over the mountain essentially means a hellacious turn every 20 seconds. Pretty much the entire car was nauseous with the driver having to stop the car so he could puke.


But, we eventually got there. And just like 5mg, 10mg is an easy ride. Euphoric and Bright. Again like a 1/2 hit of acid without the negative side effects that presents. I don't feel like i'm tripping, i just feel enhanced. Like I just ran my brain through a car wash. Pretty much non-existent OEV's and Very Mild CEV's.


Would love to re-dose 5 more mg's to push it closer to "tripping" territory, but I think I'm past the point of re-dosing for strength and am in the extending the high area.


Will not hesitate to do 15mg's next time around. Maybe even 20.

Back again with another pathetically basic question, but alas, I’m a dipshit.


I’m pretty positive this stuff is water soluble. So, let’s say I have 2 cups of water and 100mg of powder. If I dissolve the powder into the water and then divide that water into 4 equal measures, the chemical will also be evenly dispersed, right? So there would be 25mg in every 1/2 cup, right?


This seems obvious to me. But hey, what’s the point of being on a drug forum if you’re not gonna ask stupid questions every once in a while?

That's correct, it's highly water soluble, and once it's dissolved, it will be evenly distributed.  That's the whole reasoning behind using liquid measurement for really potent chems (and why you always see LSD in liquid form or on blotters/etc).


No question is stupid to ask if you're trying to be careful with drugs. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I assume you're planning to dose a few people and want to split the dose evenly?  That'll work just fine.  But a word of warning, if you're planning to store some of the doses, tryptamines break down rather quickly when they're dissolved in liquid.  So if you're trying to keep it around for a while, I wouldn't do this.  If you are trying to store it and this is just the way you're using to ensure you dose 25mg accurately, and you don't have a scale, I would recommend using a small amount of alcohol (like vodka or something), or at the VERY LEAST *distilled* water, and then freezing the unused doses, in the liquid (if you use vodka, it won't freeze but store it in the freezer).  The alcohol will prevent it from being contaminated by microorganisms.  The freezer will make it take longer to break down.  You should only bother with this if you're not trying to consume it all right away.  Also it's best to use a smaller amount of liquid than a cup full, if possible.  100mg of it will dissolve into a very small amount of water or alcohol.  Again, i you're consuming it all immediately, that also doesn't matter.  The reason I suggest a small amount is that if you use alcohol, which you should, you won't need to drink a significant amount of alcohol when you dose it.


As an aside, if you can afford drugs you can afford an AWS Gemini-20 milligram scale from amazon, they're under $30, and then you'll always be able to accurately dose.  This particular model is pretty good, with an error of +/-2mg.  It's all I've ever used

Thanks a lot, brother.


And I got a good scale. I think on your recommendation, honestly. And it works. But when weighing this stuff out in such tiny amounts, I’ve found it to be quite the pain. Trying to weigh out 15mg and I put 23mg on the scale and then i try to put 8mg back into the bag and end up putting 12mg back into it and my hands are shaking and I spill 3 mg and all that good stuff.


That’s not to say it hasn’t been a great buy. The scale has become the scale my whole group uses to weigh drugs with.

Nice, yeah they can be kind of a pain.  What I noticed makes them read more accurately is to tare it with nothing on it, then put the tray on and note how many milligrams.  Then put the drug in the tray and take note of what it weighs then, and subtract.  For some reason these scales read more accurately when they're in the middle of their range.  So if the tray weighs 2234mg, decide you want 25mg, then put powder on there until the scale reads 2259mg.

That’s actually exactly how I did it.


So, I’ve got 150mgs. If I want to dissolve it all at once but not use it immediately, I should dissolve it into an alcohol, correct? Then store the remaining liquid in the freezer?

Yeah that's what I'd do.  Though, with my Gemini-20 scale I never seem to have any problems weighing doses of tryptamines.  Just be aware it will break down much faster in liquid.  If you plan to use it all relatively soon, you're probably fine especially if you keep it in the freezer.  I wouldn't personally but you could.

Ended up just mixing it into water since we were just gonna take it immediately. This stuff really tastes like hell and it’s an added bonus to watch your friends nearly throw up after drinking 1/4th cup of MiPT flavored water. We went with 20mg a piece.


20 minutes in and we thought we might have gotten ourselves into something we didn’t want any part of. Heavy body load. Almost like an opiate, imo. Friends smoked a blunt and like last time, felt the full brunt of the load. They were lying on the deck trying to hang on for dear life. And then....bang. Light as a feather. 6 hours of laughter. Great substance and a great night. Smoooooth comedown. Easy sleep.

All I want to say is that I love 4-AcO-MiPT. I've taken it at doses from 10mg to 40mg several times in the past few months and all of the experiences were amazing in their own way. At lower doses (15mg is good) it's still quite powerful for me but I can do anything I set my mind to (writing, whatever). My partner and I took 15mg and had an incredible and insightful bonding experience.


At 40mg it found me an observer of consciousness itself. Incredible is all I can say.

I haven't had the AcO yet, but I absolutely adore 4-HO-MiPT, it's among the most good-natured and good-humored psychedelics, while still having the potential for great depth.

Musings of a man during the afternoon influenced by approximately 22 mg of the aforementioned molecule (4-HO-MiPT). I've had a religious experience while making my favorite chilli soup that I felt the need to share. A revelation I'm sure everyone who ventures to look deep forth into the void finds at one point or another:


Studying chemical interaction amongst elements has been one of the more elucidating areas of study as to my understanding of the balance of the universe.


It’s very evident that charges have a tendency to want to balance, easily observed by the attractive forces of metals and non metals on the periodic table.


I pose a question:


To what do we call ourselves, when we assign strict policies of “good”,and “evil”, upon chemical reactions that are simply balancing acts of nature. They are a result of net attractive and repulsive forces in nature, with indifference. Yet we assign human qualities to things that exist without our acknowledgment, like the natural order of these balancing forces. As such, the “goodness” or “badness” of a thing is merely a human construct imposed by us upon an indifferent nature. I suggest to anyone who reads on, that we are as significant as a single carbon atom in any organic molecule. An organism’s sole function is to survive and divide. End of discussion.


I then suggest unto any readers, that simply by existing, we fulfill our purpose in the universe. Bilogically speaking. Survive, divide, consume, die, repeat.


But there remains something deeper, of the nature of the period, in the book that is the universe that is the human experience. That which feels as significant or as insignificant as we assign it.


Cest La Vie. This is life. Love it, hate it, accept it, fight it.


Everything is as it wants to be, and everything will balance everything out in the eventuality that is existence. Such is the nature of +1 and -1. Zero. as if nothing ever happened.


Commentaries:

This was written in a +++ state.


Pre trip readings; 30 mins before the trip, fasted for 20 hours, stable blood pressure and psychologically prepared (or so I thought)...

L arm 124 / 75 - RHR 51

R arm 125 / 78 - RHR 58


Biometric readouts were (blood pressure and heart rate) Left arm; 149 / 70 RHR 91 BPM at T+3 hrs into the experience.


I felt as if I had just leapt out of an airplane without a parachute, unafraid to meet the ground. Reflections on loved ones past and the inevitable end of all of our lives played a big role as a revolving theme. I felt as if we had all been here before, and done things similar, and that we are all heading for the neutrality of (+1) + (-1) = 0. And acceptance was liberating, fear of death was extinct, I felt absolved of all anxieties, but the adrenaline coursing through my veins was incredibly potent. Like the biggest hit of meth I'd ever taken X 2 in comparison to this adrenaline and dopamine rush. Acceptance, contentedness, peace, euphoria. It was absolute bliss wrapped in adrenaline wrapped in cognitive euphoria. Like the truth has been hidden in plain sight, and the campaign of fear is built around the purely human concept that "death is bad and life is good", whereas, really, death is part of life, and we are all headed to the same place nomatter what happens inbetween. And while this is true, it is the here and the now that truly matters. And being anchored to the present is so liberating from anxieties of what may come in the future, or what has transpired in the past.


It was very freeing to accept death in this way. And also dually interesting to consider that the significance of our experience is purely subjective. And to marvel at how a complex series of chemical reactions can form a cognizant being, which every form of life in some respect, has the ability to detect stimuli, respond to these stimuli, reproduce, consume other ogranisims or molecules to help achieve the baisic functions of any entity: Survive and divide.


The racing pulse was quite an unavoidably prevasive sensation, so I had to abort the trip with 2.5 mg Etizolam. I've annoyed my girlfriend with my anecdotes and she had to leave the house to let me be in my excited, agitated, mind blown, pie eyed state. I did some yoga and drank some water. I'm not much of a yoga guy but it helped me calm down for sure.


Biometric readouts at T+4

Still coming down from one of the most incredible psychedelic experiences I've ever had while making soup.


I saw the nature of what I would dare call god, in the simplistic nature of all things. Not as an entity, but as an undeniable force, the forces of attraction and repulsion, the effect of intent on the material plane, the miracles that happen every day all around us that we take for granted every moment of every day.


It has been quite a ride. I hope this experience helps others navigate this chemical with some foresight.


Biometric readout T+5

L arm - 131 / 76 - RHR 85


Almost time to puff a joint and just ease into the evening. What a fucking ride. Wow.


Arrived home after a walk and ONE puff off a joit


8:00 pm (T+6.5 hrs)

L Arm - 135 / 76 - RHR 119.  The addition of cannabis was perhaps an unnecessary addition to the evening. Just waiting for the tachycardia to subside. Unpleasant.


The walk was a really integrative experience, every color was super saturated still, smells were more pronounced, the sun was setting, I felt a better connection with my body and my gait was very stable and straight considering all the chemicals in my body. I felt tuned in and symmeyrical, just processing all the thoughts and taking in the beauty of the supernatural world I was experiencing. It was like being in a cartoon, but more real. Very hard to explain. The etizolam definitely detracted from the depth. Upon arriving home pulse was found to be on a runaway. Most probably from just dialing in in it too much after arriving home.


+ 1 mg etizolam


Next day reflections;


In retrospect, I very much wish I hadn't had to take the etizolam, and I also wish the puff off a joint didn't make my heart rate jump up to a rate as if I was running at a medium pace.


The aborting at the first adverse reading felt like the right thing to do, if I was able to move around outside or walk or do something to keep my mind off my pounding heart, I feel like it wouldn't have been as much of an issue.


As far as concurrent readings, things seemed best at 6:30 pm (T+5 hrs after + 2.5 mg etizolam). But pulse pressure slowly widened afterwards as I continued to consume alcohol and smoke a small amount of cannabis.


Some things I'd change for next time are; stick with 17 mg total, not include any alcohol beyond about 4 drinks in total for the evening, and I'd personally avoid cannabis as it doesn't seem to mix well. And if at all possible, I'd try to avoid taking etizolam, it completely dulled the spark of the experience, but it helped ameliorate the dangerously high systolic and pulse pressure that was induced by probably partly my own psyche, and of course partly by the Miprocin.

This compound as well, just like 4-HO-MiPT has caused me the same auditory distortions I had while on DiPT. Which is interesting, I didn't have this on MiPT (without the "4-xx")

I did, on 50 mg of MiPT. I also had them on 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT and 30 mg of 4-HO-DiPT. None of them were as strong as on DiPT but none of them were as uncomfortable as DiPT was for me either, I can feel it in my ears and I get a distinct tinnitus from it both of which are unpleasant, unfortunately. Haven't had this problem yet from the other isopropyls that have done it yet though, thankfully.

I fortunately don't get auditory distortions from anything but N,N-DiPT.

I must confess I've only had 4-HO-MiPT and 4-Aco-MiPT a couple of times each, but my impression is that while both drugs have remarkably fast onset and short duration when taken orally, 4-Aco-MiPT actually seems faster in both regards.  Once when I drank a solution with 14 mg fumerate, I felt strong body energy after only 5 minutes, and after 20 minutes, I was pretty much tripping solidly with a peak reached at maybe 40 minutes in.  Sadly this peak (which was incredibly beautiful and serene) lasted only an hour or so, and by two hours in, effects had dropped off substantially.


Anyway, if 4-Aco-MiPT is absorbed faster than 4-HO-MiPT, then this might effect the qualitative experience also and may account for the subjective differences (other than time course) which people often perceive.

So it turns out that I  some 4-Aco-MiPT fumerate that is... 16 years old.  It was stored with air in a (mostly?) sealed container at room temperature and in a dark place.   These storage conditions definitely are not ideal for this compound.  I believe the color was light gray in its prime.  Now it's dark gray---almost black---and a lot of it seems to be sticking together.  Perhaps a desiccant may have helped?


So of course I had to try eating some, because it would be a tragedy to let such a fantastic compound go to waste, wouldn't it?  Of course, it could have degraded into something horrible toxic, but in my circumstances, I'm willing to take that risk.  So today I weighed out 5 mg, dropped it into some water, and swirled it.  I was pleasantly surprised to see it dissolve completely.  The liquid took on a very slight brown hue, presumably owing to impurities.  I drank it down in a few sips.  It tasted exactly as I recall.  And it worked!  It felt like it was very close full strength too.


I love this stuff!  I like that I don't really have to wait for it to come on.  I can practically feel it kicking in as soon as I drink it, and I'm well on my way after only 20 minutes.  I was surprised at the depth of the headspace at this level, which was essentially (+.5).  I pulled some weeds for 1.5 hours, and then grooved to some music.  By T+2 hours, I could tell I was already on the way down, but I had some very nice sex.  By T+3 hours, I ate a small meal, and followed that by a bigger one an hour or so later.  At T+5, it was basically done.


So actually I'd already tried this at 2.5 mg several days back, and got the response I expected.  Though it's so light, like a single 3.2% beer or something, that I wasn't sure it was really full strength.  Now after taking 5 mg, I'm fairly confident it's at least 80% of its original strength and probably higher.  Nothing here feels toxic at all.  Actually, I find 4-Aco-MiPT to feel very clean and body friendly.  I get a bunch of weird side-effects with mushrooms that I don't get here at all.  I just wish this stuff grew inside of some fungus.


My next trial, hopefully quite soon, will be with 10 mg.

I planned on taking 10 mg 4-Aco-MiPT fumerate, but my last scoop was a bit over generous and I ended up at around 11.5 mg.  I figured I might as well.  Come up started within minutes as usual.  By T+0:30, time dilation was strong and I was feeling rather strong effects.  By T+0:45 I was most of the way up, but I don't think it crested until maybe T+1:15.  It had definitely dropped a fair bit by T+2:00 but then it persisted at a fairly strong (++.5) level for some hours.  I'm at T+8:45 now, and I think it's still there at a low level.  The weed I'm smoking is helping a lot with feeling effects, but my eyes still seem dilated.  This is very weird.  In the past, I usually felt like I was pretty much done by 5 hours or so.  This time it's kept on going past 8 hours.  How very strange.


I was caught off guard by the intensity.  It was a solid (+++).  I was home alone and rode out the strongest effects in bed.  I was experiencing rather intense confusion and having trouble reasoning about time, though I didn't "lose it" completely.  I was not feeling especially comfortable in my body.  It was hard to put my finger on what was wrong, but there was a significant feeling of weakness.  Admittedly, I may have brought some anxiety into the trip and was also having kind of a "low" day for the body in the first place.  I've been exercising more intensely lately, and this week, I also got a lot of sun exposure and burned in some places.  These stresses trigger my body---nowhere near as bad as they used to, but I think I was triggered today.  I have some suspicion that the triggered state coincides with a temporary hyper-sensitivity to (at least some of the effects of) psychedelics.


While in bed, I had this thought loop in which the concept of "snakes" kept on being invoked, like a loud voice booming, over and over.  Snakes!  Snakes!  Snakes!  I have no idea why my brain latched onto that term.  I didn't arrive there from any stream of thought.  It just kind of happened and coincided with significant CEVs that weren't even very snake-like.  This episode did lead to thought tangents relating to snakes and snake symbolism: medicine, poison, the shaman as mediator of living and dead.  I had hoped that after the come-up my trip would crest into a euphoric plateau, but I wasn't finding it.  I was rather filled with fear.  Around T+1:40 I used the bathroom and looked in the mirror.  I looked frightened.  Why was I feeling so much fear?  I recognized that I was struggling to surrender to the trip and afraid to confront this fear.


I made my way out to the living room and started contemplating those things I am afraid of.  I felt strong ego blurring, and I related the fear I was feeling to the fear felt by humanity, especially those persons who wield power in our world.  I felt fearful of the future.   I felt fearful that I might die or cease to exist.  I tried to work through these things, following the music with my steps, and then I saw something truly disturbing:   ANTS!


Fucking ants.  They had invaded the house and were having a party in the middle of the floor of part of the living room.  I felt my trip immediately descend below the (+++) mark, and I acted quickly.  Experience shows that ants must be dealt with swiftly and decisively or they become very difficult to get rid of.  I immediately got out the vacuum cleaner.  I could now channel all this angst into my war against the ants.  I got rid of those I could see, turned off the vacuum, and then waited for more to show up.  Of course I was seeing crawling all over the place, so I had to distinguish between the real and merely hallucinated.


My wife came home 30 minutes later, and I commiserated with her.  She hates ants more than I do, but she thanked me for essentially shouldering the emotional burden.  Haha!  She helped a lot with lifting my mood, yet I seemed to ever prone to drift toward a rather anxious state.  I'm still feeling that tendency even now.


I decided to cook an egg and cheese sandwich because I figured I was coming down (not really) and had been annoyingly hungry the entire trip thus far.  I hoped my stomach wouldn't disagree.  I practically inhaled it, like I hadn't eaten in days.  From there on, my stomach was settled, but I didn't really get hungry again for more than a cracker here or there.


I went outside for a bit and followed my wife around the garden, trying to be helpful.  On my way out, I muttered to myself about how I was going to go outside and pretend to be me.  I did succeed in watering some things.  The visuals were definitely a lot more interesting out there, yet I felt uncomfortable.  That persistent anxiety was still with me, and I was feeling chilly.  We came inside and I fought against the ants some more and then took a bath.  The bath was great!  And then even though I didn't feel very hungry, I made myself eat at around T+7:00.  Again, I suddenly felt ravenous after I took my first bite.  I practically devoured a nice fat sandwich with lots of protein and fat.  My stomach was comfortable full.


Anyway, this experience definitely caught me off guard and has been quite difficult overall.  I'm fine as far as things go---happy to be feeling mostly reintegrated again, but it's definitely the most "out of my mind" I've felt on a psychedelic in a long time.  It's something I tend to relate to tryptamines as opposed to phenethylamines which I mostly prefer.  At the same time, the visuals weren't exactly "full on", and I feel like the mental and body aspects were a bit exaggerated relative to the other things.  The lesson for me may be that tripping when I'm "triggered" may not be the best idea because it may accentuate some but not all the effects.  At the least, I should maybe stick with lower doses under such circumstances.  Of course, I'll probably have a decent amount of post-trip integration over the next few days, and maybe I can get back to exploring those feelings of fear I got before the ants interrupted my trip.


The other thing I can say is that this 16 year old 4-Aco-MiPT fumerate, stored in the dark in a small bottle at room temperature, does not seem to have lost any significant potency.  If anything, I'm going to be a bit apprehensive about taking this again at any significant dosage because this experience was so strong and long lasting as well.

I think it's fascinating just how easy it is to eat and how good food tastes on all of the mipt family materials

It's strange.  On the one hand, I seemed to struggle with time.  On the other, my cooking ability (including synchronizing different preparation tasks) was not impaired at all.  The egg and cheese sandwich was made with a homemade sourdough english muffin, toasted and generously buttered.  The eggs were scrambled medium.  The cheese was a sharp white cheddar.  My first bite was just egg, and it went down like jello.  Absolutely delicious even by itself.  The sandwich didn't stand a chance!


Edit: We are keeping a sourdough, and earlier in the week we made the muffins.  It's a bit of effort, but they taste so good, way better than the store bought ones.  They also keep for many days at room temperature.
