## Interactions

### ⚠️ Unsafe
- **pregabalin**: There is a risk of seizures from this combination, especially at higher dosages. Caffeine additionally reduces pregabalin’s anticonvulsant effects found in lower dosages. Caffeine increases respiration rate allowing for a higher dose of sedatives than normal. If amphetamines wears off first, recreational dosages of pregabalin may overcome the individual and cause respiratory arrest. Both substances at recreational dosages cause strain of the heart and may lead to further dangerous heart complications. Medical dosages are unlikely to be of concern.

### ⚡ Caution
- **amphetamines**: This combination of stimulants is not generally necessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and greater physical discomfort.
- **amt**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **cocaine**: Both stimulants, risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and in extreme cases heart failure.
- **dextromethorphan**: High doses of caffeine can potentially exacerbate anxiety, especially during a dissociative experience, due to its stimulating effects. This combination might also lead to physical discomfort. However, individual responses to caffeine can vary significantly, often influenced by factors like habitual versus occasional usage.
- **diphenhydramine**: Caffeine as a stimulant may mask some negative side effects of DPH, leading to delusions of sobriety, which has additional concerns in states of delirium. The combination of stimulants will increase strain on the heart and may cause some physical discomfort, and has the chance to cause cardiovascular issues such as complex tachycardia. The combination may increase anxiety levels and risks of thought loops at higher dosages, in addition to increasing each other's negative side effects. Medical dosages are reported to not be a concern.
- **dox**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating it may cause some physical discomfort.
- **mdma**: Caffeine is not really necessary with MDMA and increases any neurotoxic effects from MDMA
- **mephedrone**: This combination of stimulants is not generally necessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and great physical discomfort. However, individual responses to caffeine can vary significantly, often influenced by factors like habitual versus occasional usage.
- **nbomes**: Caffeine can bring out the natural stimulation from psychedelic drugs to make it uncomfortable. High doses can cause anxiety which is hard to handle while tripping
- **pcp**: Details of this combination are not well understood but PCP generally interacts in an unpredictable manner.

### ↓ Low Risk & Decrease
- **benzodiazepines**

### ✓ Low Risk & No Synergy
- **2c-t-x**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **2c-x**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **5-meo-xxt**: High doses of caffeine may cause anxiety which is less manageable when tripping, and since both are stimulating the combination may cause some physical discomfort.
- **alcohol**
- **cannabis**
- **dmt**
- **ghb/gbl**
- **ketamine**: No unexpected interactions.
- **lsd**
- **maois**
