## SYNTHESIS
A stirred suspension of 4.8 g LAH in 400 mL anhydrous THF was brought up to a reflux, and then treated with a solution of 5.0 g of the impure N-acetyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine in 20 mL anhydrous THF. Reflux conditions were maintained for 3 days, and then after cooling in an ice bath, the excess hydride was destroyed with the careful addition of H2O. The 4.8 mL H2O (in a little THF) was followed with 4.8 mL of 15% NaOH, and finally an additional 15 mL H2O. The white, granular, basic mass of inorganic salts was removed by filtration, the filter cake washed with additional THF, and the combined filtrate and washings stripped of solvent under vacuum. The residue was dissolved in 20 mL IPA, made acidic with 40 drops of concentrated HCl, and diluted with 150 mL anhydrous Et2O. The crystalline product was removed by filtration, washed with 80% Et2O (containing IPA) followed by Et2O itself, and then air dried to provide 3.0 g of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine hydrochloride (MDE) as fine white crystals with a mp of 198â199 Â°C.

(from 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone with aluminum amalgam) To 40 g of thin aluminum foil cut in 1 inch squares (in a 2 L wide mouth Erlenmeyer flask) there was added 1400 mL H2O containing 1 g mercuric chloride. Amalgamation was allowed to proceed until there was the evolution of fine bubbles, the formation of a light grey precipitate, and the appearance of occasional silvery spots on the surface of the aluminum. This takes between 15 and 30 min depending on the freshness of the surfaces and the temperature of the H2O. The H2O was removed by decantation, and the aluminum was washed with 2Ã1400 mL of fresh H2O. The residual H2O was removed as thoroughly as possible by shaking, and there was added, in succession and with swirling, 72.5 g ethylamine hydrochloride dissolved in 60 mL warm H2O, 180 mL IPA, 145 mL 25% NaOH, 53 g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (see under MDMA for its preparation), and finally 350 mL IPA. The exothermic reaction was kept below 60 Â°C with occasional immersion into cold water and, when it was thermally stable, it was allowed to stand until it had returned to room temperature and all the insolubles settled to the bottom as a grey sludge. The clear yellow overhead was decanted and the sludge removed by filtration and washed with MeOH. The combined decantation, mother liquors, and washes, were stripped of solvent under vacuum, the residue suspended in 1500 mL of H2O, and sufficient HCl added to make the phase distinctly acidic. This was then washed with 2Ã100 mL CH2Cl2, made basic with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL of CH2Cl2. After removal of the solvent from the combined extracts, there remained 59.5 g of an amber oil which was distilled at 145â150 Â°C at 0.5 mm/Hg, producing 40.3 g of an off-white oil. This was dissolved in 600 mL IPA, neutralized with about 20 mL of concentrated HCl and then treated with 300 mL anhydrous Et2O. After filtering off the white crystals, washing with a IPA/Et2O (2:1) mixture, with Et2O and air drying, the final 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine hydrochloride (MDE) weighed 37.4 g.

(from 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone with NaBH3CN) To a well stirred solution of 31.0 g ethylamine hydrochloride in 110 mL MeOH there was added 6.6 g of 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (see under MDMA for its preparation) followed by 3.0 g sodium cyanoborohydride. Concentrated HCl in MeOH was added as required to maintain the pH at about 6 as determined with external, dampened universal pH paper. About 2 days were required for the reduction to be complete as determined by the final stabilization of the pH. The reaction mixture was added to 1 L H2O and made strongly acidic with an excess of HCl. After washing with 2Ã100 mL CH2Cl2 the aqueous phase was made basic with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent under vacuum yielded 8.3 g of a pale amber oil that was distilled at 85â100 Â°C at 0.2 mm/Hg. There was obtained 6.0 g of a water-white oil that was dissolved in 65 mL IPA and neutralized with 75 drops of concentrated HCl which produced crystals spontaneously. These were diluted with some 20 mL of anhydrous Et2O removed by filtration, washed first with IPA/Et2O (2:1), and then with Et2O. After air drying there was obtained 6.1 g of 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine hydrochloride (MDE) with a mp of 201â202 Â°C. Anal. (C12H18ClNO2) N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 160 mg) âThe first effects were felt in forty minutes and I seemed to be completely there by the end of that first hour. There was an initial slightly dizzy intoxication, and then I felt very nice. A good intoxication, with maybe a little motor incoordination. There was absolutely no appetite at all. The next morning there was still some feeling of elation but I was still very relaxed. High marks for the quality of the experience.â

(with 160 mg) âOverall this was a wonderful experience. I felt that the effect was stronger and smoother than MDMA, but perhaps the group enhancement may be partly responsible. I felt definitely fewer physiological side-effects than with MDMA, particularly the urinating problem; although there was dehydration, there was less burning annoyance.â

(with 160 mg) âI was hard hit, to the extent that there was difficulty in verbalizing and following other peopleâs thoughts. I entered the experience with some cold symptoms, and my sore throat disappeared. I felt quite intoxicated and tranquilized.â

(with 200 mg) âVery stoned. There was some nausea in the beginning of the experience. As it developed I found it very difficult to concentrate on what I was thinking or saying simply due to the extraordinary nature of coming on to this material. There is noticeable jaw-clenching and rice crispies in the ears. This is a meditative material not unlike MDMA except there are more difficulties in forming words. And there is a problem in focusing the eyes, what I want to call âeye-romp.â My anorexia was extremely long-livedâperhaps a total of 72 hours. This may have been too high a dosage.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The effects of MDE are similar in many ways to those of MDMA, but there are believable differences. The particular magic, and affective transference, does not appear to be there. There is a stoning intoxication, as there is with MDA, and there is a seemingly unrewarding aspect to the upping of the dosages, again similar to MDA, and the properties of unusually easy communication and positive self-viewing of MDMA seem to be absent. Maybe the âSâ isomer would have these properties, and they are lost in the racemate due to something coming from a more potent âintoxicatingâ âRâ isomer. The optical isomers have never been evaluated separately in man.

There are only two ways in which two drugs can interact to produce a result that is not obvious from the summing of their individual actions. One is the process of synergism, where two active materials are allowed to interact within a single individual and at one time, and the consequence of this interaction is different than that which would have been expected. The other is the process of potentiation, where only one drug is active, but the presence of the second (and inactive) drug enhances the observed action of the first. MDE seems to fall in the first category.

The âpiggy-backâ or âwindow exploitationâ studes were first discovered and explored with MDE, and have subsequently been extended most successfully with MDMA. The earliest procedure used was to assay modest quantities of active materials at the drop-off period of MDE, to exploit the open and benign state that was present. Usually, only a fraction of the standard dosage of the following drug was necessary to evoke a full experience. In psychotherapy applications, this sequence has been frequently used with MDMA followed by a second material that has been chosen to modify and expand the opening that the MDMA produced.

With the placement of MDMA under legal control in 1985, MDE occasionally appeared in the illicit street trade. It had been called EVE, which carries some perverse logic in light of the nickname used occasionally for MDMA, which was ADAM. The term INTELLECT has been used for it as well, but there has been no apparent reason advanced for this. And a final note on nomenclature. An old literature use of the code MDE was for the compound 3,4-methylenedioxyethanolamine. See the discussion on this under the recipe for DME.

I have been told of an analogue of MDE that has been synthesized, and explored by the researcher who synthesized it. It contains the N-trifluoroethyl group common to several pharmaceuticals such as Quazepam. The analogue is 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)amphetamine hydrochloride (mp 207â209 Â°C) which was made from 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine and 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone and sodium cyanoborohydride in methanol. The best final line for this compound is that it is âpossibly active.â The most heroic dosage schedule mentioned was a total of 500 milligrams, taken in three approximately equal portions over the course of five or six hours, with only a very mild intoxication and little or no sympathomimetic effects. And what little there might have been was quickly gone. A collection of totally unexplored N-substituted homologues and analogues of MDE is gathered at the end of the recipe for MDBZ.

Another direction that has been used to homologate the MDMA and MDE structure is with the length of the aliphatic chain that carries the phenyl ring and the amine function.  âHâ shows the two-carbon chain, âIâ shows the amphetamine chain length, and MDE can be called ETHYL-I. The four-carbon chain is the âJâ group, and this entire Muni-Metro concept is explained under METHYL-J.

**3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine** (also known as **MDEA** , **MDE** , and colloquially as **Eve** ) is a lesser-known [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. MDEA is chemically similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) . It produces its effects by increasing levels of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain.

The first recorded human use of MDEA was in 1976 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who noted its similarity to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) in both effects and potency, though faster to act and shorter in duration. The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of MDEA and a series of related compounds were published in 1980. MDEA is included in Shulgin's 1991 book " [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) " (" [Phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) I Have Known and Loved").

In the United States, MDEA was introduced recreationally in 1985 as a legal substitute to the newly banned MDMA before it was made a Schedule I substance two years later. Since then, MDEA has rarely been sold on its own and has largely been used as an occasional additive or substitute ingredient in pills of "Ecstasy".

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MDEA,. As a result it is highly advised to approach this potentially habit-forming [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if choosing to use it.

## History and culture

In the United States, MDEA was introduced recreationally in 1985 as a legal substitute to the newly banned MDMA before it was made a Schedule I substance two years later on August 13, 1987 under the Federal Analogue Act. Since then, MDEA has rarely been sold on its own and has largely been used as an occasional additive or substitute ingredient in pills of "Ecstasy" (for instance, studies conducted in the 1990s found MDEA present in approximately four percent of ecstasy tablets).

While MDEA shares many of the core entactogenic properties of MDMA, it is slightly less potent and considered to be more "stoning", lacking the pro-socializing and energizing "magic" most party-goers seek in their MDMA experiences. As a result, it is largely considered by most people to be a less desirable variant of MDMA and is thus rarely produced and sold in the illicit drug market, typically showing up only in small batches synthesized and distributed by hobbyist clandestine chemists.

## Chemistry

MDEA, also known as 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) chemical class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Additionally, MDEA contains an ethyl substitution on R N , which is a single carbon extension of the methyl group present in MDMA. MDEA also contains substitutions at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups that are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene bridge. MDEA shares this methylenedioxy ring with other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) .

## Pharmacology

MDEA acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) and [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) . These neurotransmitters are responsible for modulating focus, motivation, pleasure, and reward.

The "stoning" effects of MDEA are thought to arise from the higher relative activity MDEA has on releasing serotonin over dopamine compared to MDMA.

MDEA stimulates the release of oxytocin and prolactin, two hormones that are currently being studied for their potential roles in modulating the feeling of trust and love.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, MDEA is commonly regarded as significantly less stimulating and energizing than MDMA, while still retaining its core entactogenic effects. Unlike MDMA, which encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes it a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The distinct style of stimulation which MDEA presents can be described as mildly to moderately forced, trending more towards sedation and relaxation. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control, though to a far lesser degree than with MDMA.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDEA can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric relaxing sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses to the point of "flooring" or immobilizing the user. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached, before steadily dropping off. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - This effect, combined with sedation, is possibly the basis for why MDEA is frequently characterized as "stoning" relative to other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , which often have more pronounced [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) effects.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - As MDEA is a serotonin releasing agent, rise in core body temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose results in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) which can be fatal if left untreated. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - As MDEA is a serotonin releasing agent, rise in core body temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose results in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) which can be fatal if left untreated.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Like related entactogenic stimulants, feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDEA; this effect is a product of an [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and metabolism. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been a number of users who have suffered from [water intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking, so it is advised that users simply sip at the water and never over-drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of MDEA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is caused by MDEA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is usually only present in the higher dose range, and to a lesser extent than the teeth grinding associated with MDMA.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
MDEA presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctively present. These generally include:
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
MDEA is capable of producing a unique range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects are far more common during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of the experience and commonly include:
 
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of MDEA can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The broad head space of MDEA is described by many as one of moderate mental stimulation, feelings of love, warmth or empathy and powerful relaxing euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is present, but not nearly as consistent, pronounced, powerful and therapeutic than one would experience with MDMA With time and repeated use, however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instills becomes fully grounded and already in place, making people feel merely stimulated and euphoric with no new found urges to communicate, with others. Some users report that MDEA "loses its magic" with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities disappear. This does not appear to be valid for all users, however, with many users reporting that they have not experienced any decrease in quality of the experience despite dozens or even hundreds of uses.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDEA and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within MDEA and speed up the experience of time quite noticeably.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate doses of anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness between level 1 - 2 are common within MDEA. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** & **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** - Some users note extremely strange, vivid and sometimes rather scary dreams for several nights after taking large doses of MDEA.
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users note sleep paralysis after consuming MDEA, particularly in high doses or in conjunction with other factors such as lack of sleep or physical fatigue.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDEA](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDE.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Short-term physical health risks of MDEA consumption include [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) , and hyponatremia. Continuous activity without sufficient rest or rehydration may cause body temperature to rise to dangerous levels, and loss of fluid via excessive perspiration puts the body at further risk as the stimulatory and euphoric qualities of the drug may render the user oblivious to their energy expenditure for quite some time. Diuretics such as alcohol may exacerbate these risks further.

The exact toxic dosage is unknown, but considered to be far greater than its active dose.

### Neurotoxicity

As with MDMA, the neurotoxicity of MDEA use has long been the subject of debate. Scientific study has resulted in the general agreement that, although it is physically safe to try in a responsible context, the administration of repeated or high dosages of MDEA is likely to be neurotoxic and cardiotoxic in some form.

Like other powerful serotonin releasing agents, MDEA is thought to cause down-regulation of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) reuptake transporters in the brain. The rate at which the brain recovers from serotonergic changes is unclear. One study demonstrated lasting serotonergic changes in some animals exposed to MDMA, which likely applies to MDEA as well. Other studies have suggested that the brain may recover from serotonergic damage.

### Cardiotoxicity

Like with MDMA, the long-term heavy use of MDEA is likely similarly cardiotoxic, leading to valvulopathy through its actions on the 5-HT 2B receptor. In one study, 28% of long-term MDMA users (2-3 doses per week for a mean of 6 years, mean of age 24.3 years) had developed clinically evident valvular heart disease.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of MDEA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MDEA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly larger doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1-1.5 months for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2-3 months to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). MDEA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and entactogens, meaning that after the consumption of MDEA all of these will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDEA should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDEA may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **Stimulants** - The neurotoxic effects of MDEA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **Cocaine** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when MDEA is taken with many antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Additionally, if MDEA is taken with SSRIs and SNRIs, the MDEA will be significantly less powerful or may have no distinguishable effects at all.

## Effects
MDEA is closely related to MDMA. It differs mainly in how well one's own feelings are perceived (entactogenic effect), how strong empathic understanding (empathic effect) and hallucinogenic effects occur.

## Dosage
1.3 mg per kg body weight (1.3 mg x 80 kg = 100 mg)

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Nausea to nausea, dry mouth, cramping of the jaw muscles, sweating, coordination disorders, sleep disorders and trembling.

### Long-term Risks
MDA is both neurotoxic (damaging to the nerves) and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver); regular use can lead to schizophrenia-like symptoms.

## Safer Use
- First test a third or half a pill.
- Wait two hours for the effect to take effect before adding more.
- Refrain from mixed consumption.
- Avoid alcohol, drink enough non-alcoholic beverages (0.3-0.5 L per hour).
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air in between.
- Take regular breaks from consumption. The body needs time to recover.
- People taking medication are advised to inform themselves about interactions.

  "wikipedia": `# 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine*

3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine (MDEA; also called MDE and colloquially, Eve) is an empathogenic psychoactive drug. MDEA is a substituted amphetamine and a substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine. MDEA acts as a serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor.
Possession of MDEA is illegal in most countries. Some limited exceptions exist for scientific and medical research.

## Uses

### Medical

MDEA currently has no accepted medical uses.

### Recreational

MDEA is used recreationally in a similar manner to MDMA (also called ecstasy), however the subjective effects of MDEA are milder and shorter lasting. Alexander Shulgin reported it to be stoning in high doses. Most frequently consumed orally, recreational doses of MDEA are in the range 100 to 200 mg. Infrequently, MDEA is an adulterant of ecstasy pills. Studies conducted in the 1990s found MDEA present in approximately four percent of ecstasy tablets.

## Adverse effects

Reported adverse effects from MDEA include the following:

Hyperthermia
Mydriasis
Loss of appetite

## Overdose

Reported overdose symptoms of MDEA include the following:

Disseminated intravascular coagulation
Muscle rigidity
Rhabdomyolysis
Convulsions
Tachycardia
Hypotension
Sweating

## Interactions

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

MDEA is typically synthesized from essential oils such as safrole or piperonal.

## History

Alexander Shulgin conducted research on methylenedioxy compounds in the 1960s. In a 1967 lab notebook entry, Shulgin briefly mentioned a colleague's report of no effect from the substance with a 100 mg dose. Shulgin later characterized the substance in his book PiHKAL.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United States

In the United States, MDEA was introduced recreationally in 1985 as a legal substitute to the newly banned MDMA. MDEA was made a Schedule 1 substance in the United States on October 15, 1987.
