2C-B-AN, also known as 4-bromo-N-(α′-cyanobenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or as brolphetaminil, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, 2C, and N-benzylphenethylamine families related to 2C-B. It is the derivative of 2C-B with a modified NBOMe-like N-(α′-cyanobenzyl) substitution. The drug is chemically unstable and has been found to be a prodrug of 2C-B in vivo. It is active at a dose of 50 mg orally and has a duration of 5 to 8 hours. 2C-B-AN has been described as producing stimulation and certain visual alterations. It was described in the scientific literature by Daniel Trachsel in 2013, who cited personal communication with P. Rausch in 2009 as the source for the information. 2C-B-AN was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2016.
