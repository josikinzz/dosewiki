5-MeO-EiPT is a tryptamine drug that appears to have psychedelic effects. Little is known about the substance, there are nearly no experience reports for it, and the drug hasn’t really been studied.

From what is known about the drug, it may have lighter mental effects than other psychedelics. It has been made illegal in Japan and it was detected in at least one “designer drug” product in Japan in the late 2000s.

Given the lack of information about 5-MeO-EiPT, it should be taken infrequently, at the lowest possible dose, and without combinations.
