6-EAPB, also known as 1-(benzofuran-6-yl)-N-ethylpropan-2-amine, is a potentially psychedelic and potentially entactogenic drug of the benzofuran class; it is structurally related to 6-APB and MDMA.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

6-EAPB is a potent monoamine reuptake inhibitor. It shows very low potency as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

As an N-ethyl derivative of 6-APB, 6-EAPB fell outside the scope of the Temporary Class Drug ban issued by the Home Office on June 10, 2013.
The ACMD has advised that 6-EAPB (and other benzofurans) are moved to Class B, this came into action on 10 June 2014.
