**4-Hydroxy-DIPT Chemistry** 
 **by Erowid** 
---
 
 
4-HO-DiPT and [4-Acetoxy-DiPT](https://erowid.org/../4_acetoxy_dipt/4_acetoxy_dipt_chemistry.shtml) are closely related chemicals. It is possible that 4-Acetoxy-DiPT is metabolized into 4-HO-DiPT in the body in much the same way that Psilocybin is metabolized into Psilocin before it reaches the brain. They will both have very similar effects when taken orally, though dosage will be slightly different.
