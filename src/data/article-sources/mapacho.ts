## Subjective Experience

Mapacho (nicotiana rustica) has a rich history of entheogenic use, primarily amongst
South American shamans, and sometimes during ayahuasca ceremonies. It is not to
be confused with common tobacco (nicotiana tabacum), not least because its nicotine
content is commonly stated to be about 20 times higher.

My experience with this was, shall we say, not successful. Perhaps being a non-
smoker didn't help, but it was a sorry story.

\`\`\`
REPORT #1
I undertook the experiment at about 6pm. I loaded the leaves, still pungent
and fresh, into a large bong, and took two enormous hits. I'm not sure why I
was so greedy: perhaps it was the foolish notion that it was only tobacco.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
It was a pretty rough smoke, and then boom: I was suddenly dizzy and was
almost falling over as I slumped towards a soft chair. I thought I might pass
out, but I didn't.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I felt rough, very rough, with head spinning and a sense of nausea.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This gradually wore off and I returned to some sort of normality in about 15-
20 minutes. I didn't fully recover until the next day, and I had a very poor
night’s sleep.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I was completely overwhelmed by it, and vowed never to smoke it again. It
didn't feel healthy at all.
\`\`\`
Did I actually use the words “vowed never to smoke it again”? I suspect that the
following report, circa 2016, could fall under the heading "he never learns".

\`\`\`
REPORT #2
Last week I was in Vietnam, and as I tend to whenever I am in a far flung
country, I checked out the local (legal) psychoactive scene.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
In this case, I found very little. Occasionally, however, I did notice small
groups of men in the streets smoking something from huge bamboo pipes. I
presumed this to be tobacco, although I hoped it was something else.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Naturally I couldn't resist, so I approached a couple of chaps, who looked
friendly enough, and offered a few local shekels for a toke.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
They refused the money but proffered the pipe freely. In fact, they urged me to
sit down, an offer which I accepted.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Taking a large hit I immediately realized why.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I was hit for six. I was dizzy, I thought I was fainting, and I felt nausea
coming-on. It wasn’t nice. It felt very much like a re-run of my earlier
nicotiana rustica ordeal.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I didn't slump into a heap this time, but I was close.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
After a few minutes, and many deep breaths, I started to slowly get my head
together, and I took a photograph of the packet.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
On returning to the hotel, later in the evening, I asked the concierge if they
could translate the front of this and explain what it was. Yes, it was indeed
nicotiana rustica, which also bore the words Aztec tobacco and wild tobacco. I
also discovered that its more formal name there was thuoc lao.
\`\`\`
What did I deduce from this second slap in the face?

1. Perhaps this feeling is normal, and people get off on it. God knows how. By
    seating me the locals obviously knew what was coming.
2. I had consumed about 3 bottles of beer: the experience sobered me up
    instantly, and I remained so for the rest of the evening. Indeed, I didn't feel
    like engaging any further intoxicant of any type, and didn't drink for the
    rest of the night.

\`\`\`
After about half an hour, I felt half-decent and strangely clear-headed. In
fact, I felt quite good. Perhaps this phase is the attraction.
\`\`\`
3. Like the first time, it felt rather toxic and unhealthy. It's hard to see how
    anyone could get used to this, but they do appear to. I have no idea what it
    does to the health of habitual users, but it certainly can't be good news.

Despite the flip side, I'm glad that I re-sampled, largely to have experienced it in a
more authentic setting than my room. However, I don't see any scenario at all in
which I will repeat it again.

This time I mean it.

ADDITIONAL SAFETY NOTE
It is reported that due to its high nicotine content large doses of mapacho can present
the risk of acute poisoning and potentially death. Take it easy!

  "wikipedia": `# Nicotiana rustica
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_rustica*

Nicotiana rustica, commonly known as Aztec tobacco or strong tobacco, is a rainforest plant in the family Solanaceae native to South America.  It is a very potent variety of tobacco, containing up to nine times more nicotine than common species of Nicotiana such as Nicotiana tabacum (common tobacco). More specifically, N. rustica leaves have a nicotine content as high as 9%, whereas N. tabacum leaves contain about 1 to 3%. The high concentration of nicotine in its leaves makes it useful for producing pesticides, and it has a wide variety of uses specific to cultures around the world. However, N. rustica is no longer cultivated in North America (except in small quantities by certain Native American tribes) as N. tabacum has replaced it.

## Uses

### South America

Nicotiana rustica is called mapacho in South America. It is often used for entheogenic purposes by South American shamans, because of the comparatively high levels of harmala alkaloids and nicotine. There are many methods of administration in South American ethnobotanical preparations. In a preparation known as singado or singa, N. rustica is allowed to soak or be infused in water, and the water is then insufflated. In Peru it is known as "Mapacho" and is smoked in pipes or drunk as a juice. The plant can also be smoked in cigars, administered as an enema, and made into a lickable product known as ambil. Finally, N. rustica is a common ingredient in rapé, a smokeless tobacco product usually used as a nasal snuff. (See also Göteborgs Rapé.)  Rapé is often a combination of N. rustica and a host of other herbs, depending on the intended use, including tonka beans, cinnamon, clove buds, soda ash (creating nu-nu), Anadenanthera, Erythroxylum, Virola, and more. In Amazonian traditions, rapé is a finely powdered nasal snuff typically prepared from the leaves of Nicotiana rustica mixed with ashes derived from the bark of particular tree species. The dried ingredients are pounded and filtered to produce a very fine dust. Varieties of N. rustica used include “corda”, “moi”, and in some contexts fermented mapacho. Due to its high nicotine content—often several times greater than Nicotiana tabacum—rapé is considered potent and is used ritually for its grounding and focusing effects. The choice of tree ashes and additional plant ingredients varies among different groups and is often specific to individual tribes.

### Russia

In Russia, N. rustica is called makhorka (маxорка). Historically, makhorka was smoked mainly by the lower classes. N. rustica is a hardy plant and can be grown in most of Russia (as opposed to other Nicotiana species which require a warm climate), it was more readily and cheaply available, and did not depend on transport in a country with an underdeveloped road network and climatic portage problems. This remained the case until cultivated tobacco became widely available in the 20th century.
During Soviet times, rustic tobacco was an important industrial crop of agriculture. In those times, dozens of varieties were bred, some of them considered equal in quality to cultivated tobacco. In modern times, makhorka is still sometimes smoked by peasants and farmers due to its high availability and being almost free for them.

### Vietnam

The plant is called Thuốc lào in Vietnam, and is most commonly smoked after a meal on a full stomach to "aid in digestion", or along with green tea or local beer (most commonly the cheap bia hơi). A "rít" of thuốc lào is followed by a flood of nicotine to the bloodstream inducing strong dizziness that lasts several seconds. Heavy cigarette smokers have had trouble with the intense volume of smoke and the high nicotine content; side effects include nausea and vomiting.
There are many "brands" of tobacco, most of which are specific to the region in which they are grown. Some of these "brands" are mellow in flavor and effect, some are more energizing, and some are known for their relaxing properties.
Water pipes can be found everywhere, and are a fixture of local tea booths, eateries, and cafes. It is common to find a table with a small box of tobacco at these establishments from which anyone can help themselves to a bowl during a tea or work break.
The main difference between smoking thuốc lào and the use of other tobaccos is in the method of consumption, in that thuốc lào is consumed with a water pipe. The smoker is presented with either a bamboo pipe called a điếu cày (English: "farmer's pipe") or a ceramic hookah called a điếu bát. It may also occasionally be smoked in a more uncommon pipe known as a điếu ống. The pipe is filled with an appropriate amount of water and a small amount of thuốc lào is pressed into the bowl.

One then ignites the tobacco and inhales to create a body of smoke inside the pipe, before exhaling the smoke, reversing the process of air in the pipe by blowing into it to pop out the tobacco. The smoker then sharply inhales, usually tilting the pipe upwards to an almost horizontal position (but not completely, as the water would drain into the mouth).

### Turkey

Maraş otu (English: Maraş weed) is a chewing variant of Nicotiana rustica commonly used by people who live in Maraş, Turkey and other areas of the country. Maraş Otu is a mixture of Oak tree ash and Nicotiana rustica that resembles henna.  They use this by putting the mixture under their lips like Swedish snus or Afghan naswar. It is recognized as a drug by anti-drug activists. It can contribute to mouth cancers.

### Sudan

In Sudan, this type of tobacco is called toombak (Arabic: توومباك).  It has been used for over 400 years. Being a form of smokeless tobacco, the tobacco leaves are cured, dried, ground and then mixed with sodium bicarbonate. As such, the freebase nicotine in this product is highly addictive.

## Ecology

Nicotiana rustica serves as a larval host plant for Chrysodeixis includens and Phthorimaea operculella. Known pollinators of Nicotiana rustica include: Augochlorella aurata, Lasioglossum perpunctatum, Bombus impatiens, Lasioglossum tegulare, Augochlora pura, Lasioglossum michiganense, Lasioglossum versans, Bombus vagans, Halictus ligatus, Lasioglossum oblongum, Halictus rubicundus, Megachile frigida, and Sphecodes heraclei.
