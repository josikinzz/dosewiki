## Subjective Experience

Noopept was developed by a Russian pharmaceutical company in the 1970s, and is a
prescription drug in that country.

In recent years it has emerged as one of the most commonly used drugs in this class.
Its profile and popularity has been such that it has repeatedly attracted the attention
of the mainstream media.

This experiment was, in fact, my first experience with a formally recognised
nootropic. Given again that I purposely refrain from ever taking the same chemical
on a regular basis, it was a one-off exercise, which is counter to the usual modus
operandi for this class of drug.

```
T+0:00 I take two 10mg pills
```
```
T+0:20 A light head tingle is now developing. There is no body-load or any
other physical effect.
```

```
T +1:00 I am experiencing a low level buzz, but no blur. There is no euphoria
or significant mood shift, but my disposition is generally good. I simply feel
content, so if a mood-shift is in play at all, it is slightly positive. There is
certainly no anxiety.
```
```
T +4:00 I take my afternoon power-nap, and I am able to sleep normally. Note
as background that last night was a late night.
```
```
T+5:00 I take another 10mg.
```
```
T+6:00 It is easy to forget that I have consumed a chemical, but at the same
time, I am aware of its effects when I do actually think about it.
```
```
Subjectively I believe that am experiencing some mental clarity and focus, but
the accompanying buzz is extremely mild.
```
```
T+7:00 At this point I swallow another 10mg pill, bringing the overall dose for
the day to 40mg.
```
```
In one respect this feels like the opposite of alcohol, with which vision (along
with perception) tends to be hazy. Vision under the influence of this chemical
seems to be clearer than usual, and if the experience itself is focused upon, I
feel a certain strangeness, which is not unpleasant.
```
```
Also unlike post-alcohol consumption, I am also able to work well, with
lucidity and a clear head.
```
```
T+8:00 I take a final 10mg, and continue to feel more or less as I have for the
last couple of hours.
```
```
At 50mg my total intake over the last 8 hours has been a somewhat heavy, and
is not recommended. To some degree curiosity rather than compulsion has got
the better of me.
```
```
Do I have the slight hint of a headache? Perhaps I have, but it is mild, and it
passes.
```
```
From here, I drift slowly back to normality, before retiring to bed.
```
Noopept probably does more or less what is described in the script. There is a strange
background feel about it, with visible clarity, and there is at least the perception of a
positive effect on mental functionality.

This is not really a stimulant, sedative or psychedelic, in the traditional sense, but
there is a distinct experience in play, albeit a mild one.

Notwithstanding its subtle nature, I found noopept to be one of the more noticeable
chemicals in this class.
