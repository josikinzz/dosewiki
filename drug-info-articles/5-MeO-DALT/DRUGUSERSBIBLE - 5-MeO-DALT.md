## Subjective Experience

This compound is memorable largely because it represents the most glaring mistake
I have ever made with respect to dosing. Given the advice I provide throughout this
book regarding this issue, I cannot possibly account for the error. It was a mental
aberration, and I was fortunate that it occurred with a relatively benign drug.

The dose I was aiming for was 10mg, hoping for a light and relatively short
psychedelic buzz. I went ahead and measured 0.1 on the scales. Yes, this was 100mg;
or 10x my intended dose.

Once it was down the hatch I realized what I had done but it was too late. I made
efforts to vomit, even drinking salty water, but to no avail. The panic which ensued
was far from pleasant, but the onset of the drug itself took the edge away, and I
manoeuvred my way through it, consuming copious amounts of water, and eating
like a pig.

The trip itself was far from remarkable. It comprised largely a light psychedelic
headspace, accompanied by body tingles and perhaps some sedation. There was no
significant come-down or hangover; just a lesson never to repeat the same mistake.
