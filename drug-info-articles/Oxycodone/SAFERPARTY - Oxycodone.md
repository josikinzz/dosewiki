## Effects
Oxycodone has analgesic, depressant, antianxiety, cough suppressant and psychotropic properties. More intense dreams may also occur. Due to its relaxing and euphoric properties, it is used as a recreational drug, and is said to be more stimulating and mood-lifting than other opioids.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Very common side effects, as with all opioids, are constipation and constriction of the pupils. Drowsiness, dizziness, headache, itching, muscle twitching, sleep disturbances and mood swings are also to be expected. In women, menstruation may also be absent.
Other opioid-typical side effects such as hallucinations, confusion, vomiting and nausea are less common with oxycodone.
Overdoses with oxycodone are life-threatening, as the substance has a strong respiratory depressant effect even in low doses when abused, which can lead to respiratory arrest and coma. For opioid addicts, the lethal dose can be much higher. An overdose is treated by taking naloxone, an opioid antagonist.

### Long-term Risks
The consumption of oxycodone leads to physical and psychological dependence after a short time, even more quickly than with morphine. Tolerance builds up, which is why higher and higher doses have to be consumed. Strong withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, irritability, depression, insomnia, sweating, cold shivers, vomiting, diarrhoea and painful cramps may occur.

## Safer Use
- Opioids are highly effective drugs that should only be used for a limited time and at best under medical supervision.
- Start with a low dose and wait for the effect and tolerance before adding more. Do not exceed the maximum daily dose.
- If you inject opioids, dose even more carefully, as the range between desired effect (rush) and dangerous overdose is even more difficult to assess. Avoid injecting fentanyl; the risk of overdose is particularly high. Always use new (clean and sterile) injection material! Never exchange syringes, filters, water, disinfection swabs to avoid transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use opioids. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses are much higher and can be fatal for new users.
- Take longer breaks (at least several days) between consumption.
- After a period of abstinence, take a much lower dose! The usual dose before the abstinence phase can otherwise quickly have life-threatening consequences.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, benzodiazepines and/or other opioids is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!
- Refrain from citrus fruits (especially grapefruit) before or during consumption. The combination can lead to an increase in the effect of the opiate and/or to respiratory depression.
