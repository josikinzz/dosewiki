## Subjective Experience

My experiences with salvia divinorum bore little resemblance to those of the
shamans, as reported in literature. This is surely due to the fact that they chewed,
whilst I smoked. Indeed, I smoked extracts on each of my three trips, rather than the
raw plant itself, and these were of the order of 50x.

These forays were not pleasant. Each time I was overwhelmed, largely by fear. This
was despite the fact that on the last two occasions I thought I had it nailed.

The first trip took me completely by surprise: I do mean completely, given that I
thought I had purchased some sort of cannabinoid. For the second I was better
prepared: I lay on a bed in the dark to contemplate. For the third, I had a sitter.
Regardless of circumstance, however, I felt myself leaving my bodily existence and
hanging on, or trying to hang on, in abject terror.

Colour became bright, edges became extremely sharp, and everything seemed to be
morphing in a terrifying manner, stacking into an infinity of two dimensional layers.
None of this was helped by the fact that I was inexperienced: these were amongst my
earliest expeditions into the deliriant /psychedelic world

During each trip I had the curious notion that I was in a realm from which I could see
different timelines unfolding and inviting in front of me. Also, that there was some
form of intelligence there, which was aloof, and which was not necessarily benign.
Indeed, the undertones were sinister.

I felt at the time that I got nothing out of these, at least in a positive sense. I now
realise that the long-term value of the insights and perspectives I gained from them
was in fact significant, even if the experiences themselves were traumatic (see the
train metaphor described in Section 2.2).

The three trips were recorded as follows:

```
TRIP #1
I took a single hit of my apparent cannabinoid in the garden, from my small
portable bong. I then walked slowly through the kitchen towards my office,
when it struck me: suddenly.
```
```
Rather than a mellowing and glowing relaxation, there was sharpness to
edges, and there was a transposed repetition of objects like they were stacked
behind each other multiple times. There was the immediate understanding
that I was gripped by something and it wasn’t a cannabinoid!
```
```
Yes, I was terrified, as I stumbled into the office. Sinking to my hands and
knees I crawled, and somehow pulled myself up into my chair.
```
```
Everything on the computer screen presented the same stacked manifestation,
with each window being repeated behind itself into the distance. I hit the
keyboard in panic, obviously to no effect.
```
```
How long would this last? Had I permanently damaged myself? Had I really
done it this time?
```
```
I was overcome by the fear that I might never return to normality.
```
```
Eventually, I did start to return, to my enormous gratitude and relief. I
managed to walk back into the kitchen. As I stood I felt something very
strange. I felt connected to others, not through memory but through some
strange sense; a sense that was in fact focused through a lens of compassion.
This passed quickly, and could have been related to the overwhelming sense of
relief that I was still feeling, but I distinctly recall it to this day.
```
```
Of course, as soon as I was able, I researched salvia divinorum via the
Internet, and the cause of this apparent derangement became clear.
```
```
TRIP #2
On the second occasion I planned the experience carefully, and I thought I was
ready. I drew the curtains in my bedroom and lay on the bed. I was fearful of
walking and hurting myself so I blocked the door.
```

```
Unfortunately, the preparation and anticipation did not mitigate the shock. It
was still harrowing. The same sliced manifestation of reality occurred, with
the same infinity of 2D layers morphing before me.
```
```
I sensed some other entity, possibly hostile, and had to suppress the urge to
negotiate and plead for my safe return.
```
```
The experience was again other-worldly. I felt as though I was being sucked
out of this reality, into some other. Perhaps this is why some of the people in
those YouTube trip videos appear to pull against some invisible non-existent
force.
```
```
This feeling induced panic. I didn’t want to go, and I sensed that the
anomalous presence was not benevolent. I swore myself to be a force for good,
as I felt like I was bargaining for my life.
```
```
Fearing that I was leaving this realm for ever, I thought about my family, and
all that I valued. I felt a primal need to fight to stay: I got off the bed and
pushed my way out of the door.
```
```
As I lurched onto the landing, I thought momentarily that I was recovering,
but I wasn’t.
```
```
I found myself looking up the stairs to the third floor, and again, the notion
occurred that I was looking at alternative timelines, or parallel worlds. The
thought that I might return to the wrong one suddenly struck me, as my usual
surroundings felt so alien and unfamiliar. In some of those worlds, it seemed
that the house even had the wrong number of floors.
```
```
Things still didn’t seem to be right as I shuffled down the stairs, but I was
slowly emerging and returning to normality. When I came round sufficiently, I
called family and friends, just to connect and to make sure that all was well
and that I had found my way back into the correct slice of the continuum.
```
```
TRIP #3
This was a chicken trip; meaning that I barely inhaled. I did, however, smoke
enough to skirt around the experience and semi immerse.
```
```
The same feelings were prevalent, but having someone present gave me a
firmer anchor of this reality. I was still scared, very scared, as I stared into the
threatening space which enveloped me, and I recall that again I tried to open
dialogue, through panic.
```
```
As this slowly wore off I swore that I wouldn’t put myself through it again.
```
Despite all this, if I ever find the opportunity to engage this interesting plant through
its traditional and shamanic oral route, I will probably take it. Otherwise: no chance!

AN ANECDOTAL TALE (THE BLAST)
As I approached the counter in the head shop, a young man, perhaps 20 years of age,
was stood directly in front of me, dithering. He pointed at a colourful packet which
sat on the display, and mumbled words to the effect that he and his friends wanted to
have “a blast”.

The sales attendant couldn’t help or advise, and would only respond to his questions
with the legally prescribed mantra: “It’s not for human consumption”.

I then noticed that our young test pilot was pointing at a sachet of salvia divinorum
(60x extract).

This rang alarm bells: his mates were clearly hiding around the corner outside, and
they were likely to smoke this stuff somewhere in the street, with no idea at all of the
effect they would be inducing.

Salvia wouldn’t give them a blast; it would detonate the unexpected trauma of an
out-of-body experience, potentially in a packed street, potentially on a busy road. I
felt compelled to intervene.

I tried to explain, but the guy had clearly been drinking alcohol.

What to do?

I looked for the safest bet on offer on the presentation stand, and referred him to a
well known stimulant. I explained that this was a terrible idea (given his alcohol
consumption), but that snorting a stim would on balance be more likely to give him a
good time, and less likely to lead to a nasty accident in the middle of the city.

He bought my logic, and purchased.

The assistant then smiled at me and said “Well done. Are you his dad or just a good
Samaritan?”

Then it took a turn for the worse.

The kid returned, and asked for the salvia instead. It appeared that the scare story
had appealed to his foolhardy mates. So off he went, armed with his blast, to take
him directly to la-la land.

I am pretty certain that one toke on the salvia joint (which is how they planned to
smoke it) will have demonstrated that my every word had been correct. I sincerely
hope that their lesson was learned in a park or somewhere quiet, rather than in a
place of potentially fatal danger.

You can’t win ‘em all.
