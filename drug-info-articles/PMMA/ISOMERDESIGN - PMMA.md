For a completely silly and romantic reason. When the MDMA story became front-page news back in mid-1985, the cartoonist-author of Doonesbury, Gary Trudeau, did a two-week feature on it, playing it humorous, and almost (but not quite) straight, in a hilarious sequence of twelve strips. On August 19, 1985 he had Duke, president of Baby Doc College, introduce the drug design team from USC in the form of two brilliant twins, Drs. Albie and Bunny Gorp. They vividly demonstrated to the enthusiastic conference that their new drug âIntensityâ was simply MDMA with one of the two oxygens removed. âVoila,â said one of them, with a molecular model in his hands, âLegal as sea salt.â And what is MDMA with one oxygen atom removed? It is 4-methoxy-N-methylamphetamine or METHYL-MA which, according to the twins, should give the illusion of substance to oneâs alter ego. So, I called it Doonesamine, or simply âDOONEâ for short. Maybe that was also a homonym for Frank Herbertâs science fiction book, âDune,â wherein the magical drug âspiceâ provided a most remarkable alteration of the userâs state of consciousness.

This comic strip presentation was the first nationally distributed allusion to the term âdesigner drugs,â and perhaps it lent unexpected support for the passage, just a year later, of the Controlled Substances Analogue Enforcement Act of 1986. This intentionally vague piece of legislation makes the giving of, or the taking of, or even the possession with the intent to take, any drug that in any way alters your state of consciousness, a felony. A shameful and desperate effort by the governmental authorities to maintain the image of control in a lost situation.

Enough editorial. Back to historic technicalities. In truth, METHYL-MA is a well studied drug, at least in animals. In both mice and rats, it is an exceptionally potent agent in creating the state of catatonia. Animal studies, prompted by the clandestine synthesis of METHYL-MA, have shown that there is indeed locomotor stimulation and some central effects, but these effects are somehow different than those of a simple amphetamine-like agent. The experimenterâs conclusions, based on its structural resemblance to 4-MA and its proclivity to produce catatonia in some animal species and the ever-present possibility that there might be unsuspected neurochemical changes to be seen with its use, are that human experimentation should be discouraged. I have come to the same conclusion, but in my case this is based on a much more succinct observation: I tried it and I didnât like it.

A brief comment on two of the N,N-dimethylhomologues of methoxyamphetamine. One was 4-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine, 4-MNNA. This material, made by the reductive amination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone with dimethylamine, was a colorless oil, which distilled at 70â85 Â°C at 0.3 mm/Hg. The corresponding 2-methoxy-N,N-dimethylamphetamine was similarly made. 2-MNNA was also a colorless oil and had the same bp. Both of them were fluorinated with 18F labelled acetyl hypofluorite (3% and 6% yields respectively) but neither of them was pursued any further in the search for a brain blood flow indicator.
