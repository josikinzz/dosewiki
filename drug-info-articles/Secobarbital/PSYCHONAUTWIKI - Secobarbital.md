**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Secobarbital** , also known as **secobarbitone** in British English and by the brand name **Seconal** , is a short-acting psychoactive drug of the [barbiturate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) class which produces powerful anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and amnesic effects. The combination drug **Tuinal** has a combination of secobarbital and amobarbital. Secobarbital is used medically as a hypnotic for the short-term treatment of insomnia and as an [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression) in emergency situations, such as status epilepticus. Secobarbital works in a similar fashion to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) , however, barbiturates bind to a different and distinct allosteric site on the GABA A receptor.

Compared to other barbiturates such as [phenobarbital](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenobarbital) , secobarbital has a prompt onset of action, generally working within fifteen minutes of ingestion. Secobarbital's anxiolytic effects may last for up to 24 hours after the primary effects have worn off.

Secobarbital, like most short-acting barbiturates, is deemed to be extremely addictive. The abrupt discontinuation of secobarbital in dependent individuals may be life-threatening and lead to [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) and even death . Secobarbital drastically enhances the effects of other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) such as [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , and concurrent use may lead to [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) and possibly death.

## Chemistry

Secobarbital is a drug of the [barbiturate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) class. Barbiturate drugs contain the backbone of barbituric acid. Secobarbital has a propenyl, and a methylpentane substitution on the 5-position of the barbituric acid backbone which gives it its unique pharmacological effects. The empirical formula of secobarbital is C 12 H 18 N 2 O 3 and has a molar mass of 238.283 grams per mole.

## Pharmacology

Barbiturates behave similarly to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) . Secobarbital binds to an allosteric site on the GABA A receptor and potentiates the effects of the endogenous ligand, [gamma-aminobutyric acid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) . When barbiturates bind to the GABA A receptor, it causes the ion pore to open for extended periods of time, causing an increase of intracellular chlorine ion concentrations. As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of barbiturates on the nervous system.

Around 45-60% of the secobarbital binds to membrane proteins. Secobarbital is metabolized in the liver and excreted by the kidneys. Its biological half-life is from 15 to 40 hours.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, this drug has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)** - Barbiturates may decrease blood pressure in some individuals and have occasionally been used to reduce intracranial pressure.
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Compared to other GABAergic [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , this effect is particularly strong.
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - Compared to other agents such as [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) , this effect is generally considered to be quite weak. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , high doses of secobarbital may cause blurred vision. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Compared to other GABAergic [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) , this effect is particularly strong. The feeling itself can be described as an extremely strong feeling of relaxed contentment.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - At higher doses, secobarbital is known to cause slurred speech.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary, such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Toxicity and harm potential

Secobarbital likely has moderate toxicity relative to dose. However, secobarbital is [[Toxicity::potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) . Secobarbital has a higher risk of death or serious adverse effects associated with concurrent [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) use than other drugs such as benzodiazepines. There have been studies linking the use of barbiturates, particularly [phenobarbital](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenobarbital) , with the development of cancer.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Secobarbital is extremely physically and psychologically addictive. Barbiturate withdrawal is medically serious and can potentially cause a life-threatening withdrawal syndrome that can cause [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and death. Drugs that lower the seizure threshold, such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) should be avoided during withdrawal. If an individual is addicted to a short-acting barbiturate such as secobarbital, switching to a longer acting drug such as [phenobarbital](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenobarbital) may be of some benefit.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects of secobarbital after prolonged use. It is unknown exactly how long it takes for tolerance to reach baseline. Secobarbital presents cross-tolerance with all barbiturates, meaning that after its consumption, all barbiturates will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many drugs are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be harmless in low doses of each but still increase the potential risk of death. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should try to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.Secobarbital is deemed to have an increased incidence of serious adverse effects when used concurrently with other depressants than other depressants.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can lead to an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is unsafe to combine barbiturates with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of barbiturates, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of barbiturates will be considerably increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as other effects. If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of barbiturates per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

### Overdose

Barbiturate overdose may occur when a barbiturate is taken in extremely heavy quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work in a similar fashion but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor, thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Barbiturate overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and properly. Barbiturate overdose has an increased frequency of serious adverse effects when compared to other depressants.

Symptoms of a barbiturate overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death.
