## Subjective Experience

I sampled this in March 2015, shortly before it was banned in the UK via a
Temporary Class Drug Order (TCDO). Compared to other stims in its class it was
potent, at least mg for mg, but I did not find it to be particularly recreational.

It was certainly functional, in that I was lively and awake under its influence. In line
with the durations cited by reference sites, I also recall that I was stimulated for
almost the entire day.

Due to the legislation, lack of significant uplift in mood, and occasional warnings of
vasoconstriction and associated risks, I only tested it on the one occasion. Despite
this, and again demonstrating that experience is subjective, 3,4-CTMP was a winner
('fastest riser') in the VICE Netherlands Designer Drug Awards in 2014. It was also
the most searched for drug on one of the main Internet forums in 2012, and was
sometimes suggested as an alternative to methylphenidate.

By and large, it now appears to have faded into the annals of history.
