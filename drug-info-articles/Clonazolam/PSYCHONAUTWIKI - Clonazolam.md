**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Clonazolam** (also known as **Clonitrazolam** ) is a novel [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) chemical class which produces [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) , [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) , [muscle relaxant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxant) , and [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . This compound is a novel [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) derivative of the FDA-approved drugs [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) ( **Klonopin** , **Rivitrol** ) and [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) ( **Xanax** ). Clonazolam is reported to be roughly 2.5x as potent as alprazolam.

The synthesis of clonazolam was first reported in 1971. It was described as the most active compound in the series tested. Clonazolam is reputed to be highly potent, and concerns have been raised that it and [flubromazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Flubromazolam) may pose comparatively higher risks than other designer benzodiazepines due to their ability to produce strong sedation and amnesia at oral doses as low as 0.5 mg, or 500 micrograms (µg). It is reported to have a medium-length onset of action (20 - 60 minutes).

Very little is known about this substance, but it has recently become easily accessible through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors where it is being sold as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) . Due to its extremely high potency, it is often found on blotter paper or in [volumetrically dosed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) solutions. Ingestion of raw clonazolam powder is unsafe due to its microgram-range potency and the ease in which it can lead to multi-day blackouts.

[Sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can cause seizures (which may be life-threatening in certain cases ) for individuals who have been heavily using them for a prolonged period of time. For this reason, it is recommended to gradually lower the daily dose over a period of time instead of stopping abruptly — a technique known as [tapering](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tapering) .

Due to the high dependence-forming and addiction potential that this substance shares with other members of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class, as well as its [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) -like ability to induce dangerously [disinhibited](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) [black-out](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) states, it is strongly advised to use proper [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if choosing to use this substance.

## Chemistry

Clonazolam is a drug of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class. Benzodiazepine drugs contain a benzene ring fused to a diazepine ring, which is a seven membered ring with the two nitrogen constituents located at R 1 and R 4 . The benzyl ring of clonazolam is substituted at R 8 with a nitro group, NO 2 -. Further, the diazepine ring is bonded at R 6 to a 2-chlorinated phenyl ring.

Clonazolam also contains a 1-methylated triazole ring fused to and incorporating R 1 and R 2 of its diazepine ring. Clonazolam belongs to a class of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) containing this fused triazole ring, called triazolobenzodiazepines, distinguished by the suffix "-zolam." Clonazolam is also a nitrobenzodiazepine, a subclass of benzodiazepines which contain a nitro (NO 2 -) group. Other nitrobenzodiazepines include [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) and flunitrazepam.

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of Clonazolam on the nervous system.

The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels (VDSC) rather than benzodiazepine receptors. Clonazolam is hydroxylated, and is mainly reduced to the 7-amino benzodiazepine and then acetylated.

In a series of triazolobenzodiazepines, it was the most active overall, sometimes proving effective at under 10 μg/kg in mice.

## Subjective effects

Clonazolam is reported to be similar to alprazolam and other benzodiazepines that suppress emotions and produce moderate-strong feelings of relaxation, pleasure and comfort in the body. This seems to present itself more often in those with pre-existing anxiety. Many anecdotal reports from users of this compound have stated it as being one of the most euphoric benzodiazepines.

The cognitive effects of clonazolam are thought to be mainly amnesic, but also include most other typical effects seen with benzodiazepines. Clonazolam is reported to cause "blackouts" at a higher rate than other benzodiazepines.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Clonazolam has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - This effect is particularly strong when compared to other benzodiazepines such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - This effect is particularly strong when compared to other benzodiazepines. Losing your balance can become easy incredibly quickly if not careful. Holding onto a wall or rail is sometimes necessary due to the severe inability to walk straight.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Like many [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , Clonazolam is known to cause blurred or otherwise suppressed visual acuity in higher doses. ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). 
These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Clonazolam is reported to cause "blackouts" at a higher rate than other benzodiazepines.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - A distinct portion of users report feeling a marked sense of emotional well-being and comfort while under the influence of this substance. Because this does not occur regularly or consistently for most users, it is speculated that this effect only manifests among those who have unusually high baseline levels of anxiety. However, people without anxiety issues also report clonazolam as being euphoric.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of antipsychotics.
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Clonazolam primarily suppresses short-term memory, resulting in forgetfulness, and/or disorganized behaviors.
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Due to clonazolam's heavy sedation and lethargy, doing any type of activity that requires moving, or high amounts of effort may be difficult to do on this compound, especially at higher doses.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - Clonazolam & most benzodiazepines are known to cause slurred speech and difficulty communicating words in a clear fashion.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** or **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While clonazolam can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, its effects may persist into the morning afterwards, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**

## Common usage

### Preparation methods

- **[Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing)** - If one's benzodiazepines are in powder form, they are unlikely to weigh out accurately without the most expensive of scales due to their extreme potency. Clonazolam is especially important to weigh out and volumetrically dose properly due to it being active in the microgram range. To avoid adverse effects, one can dissolve the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) volumetrically into a solution and dose it accurately based upon the methodological instructions linked within this tutorial [here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Clonazolam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially lethal when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Clonazolam is generally considered to be extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases, this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Clonazolam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Discontinuation and withdrawal

Benzodiazepine discontinuation is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals using regularly to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [high blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/High_blood_pressure) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Substances which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Abrupt discontinuation also causes rebound stimulation which presents as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) and restlessness. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

If one wishes to discontinue after a period of regular use, it is safest to reduce the dose each day by a very small amount for a couple of weeks until close to abstinence. If using a short half-life benzodiazepine such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) or [etizolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam) , a longer acting variety such as [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) or [clonazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonazepam) can be substituted. Symptoms may still be present, but their severity will be reduced significantly.

For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) . Small quantities of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) can also help to reduce the symptoms, but otherwise cannot be used as an effective tapering agent.

The duration and severity of withdrawal symptoms depend on a number of factors including the half-life of the substance used, tolerance and the duration of abuse. Major symptoms will usually start within just a few days after discontinuation and persist for around a week for shorter lasting benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines with longer half-lives will exhibit withdrawal symptoms with a slow onset and extended duration. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur with extremely high doses or, more commonly, when it is taken with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) . This risk is especially present with other [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) depressants, such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , since they work in a similar fashion but bind to distinct sites on the GABA A receptor, resulting in significant cross-potentiation. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly. Symptoms may include severe [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , and non-responsiveness. The user might seem like they are sleepwalking. The user is also more susceptible to consume more of the same or another substance due to their impaired judgement, which is typically not seen with other substances during overdose.

Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Care is primarily supportive in nature, although overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist or additional procedures such as [adrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) injections if other substances are involved. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.
