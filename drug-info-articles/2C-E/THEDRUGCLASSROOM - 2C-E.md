# 2C-E
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-e/*

2C-E is a psychedelic phenethylamine which also has some entactogen effects. It’s a member of the 2C family ( [2C-B](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-b/) , 2C-P, [2C-I](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-i/) , etc) and is a very energetic and stimulating psychedelic.

When you’re in a social setting, it’s possible for some empathy and love effects to appear, though they are not as intense or notable as MDMA’s.

The drug is often harder to handle than 2C-B due to intense psychological and physical effects.

Its LD50 is not known and while a couple deaths have been attributed to it, it’s not clear what amount should be considered dangerous. Due to the lack of information, it’s wise to minimize your use, take the smallest possible dose, and avoid combinations.
