LSA (also known as Ergine, d-lysergic acid amide, and d-lysergamide) is an alkaloid of the ergoline family that occurs in various species of vines, the morning glory flower and some species of fungi. It is the dominant alkaloid found in the seeds of several varieties of morning glories in concentrations of approximately 10 µg per seed, as well as Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds at a concentration of around 0.13% of dry weight. It has structural similarities to LSD, putting it in the lysergamide family of psychedelics.

A traditional use of morning glory seeds by Mexican Native Americans was first described by Richard Schultes in 1941 in a short report documenting their use going back to Aztec times. Further research was published in 1960, when Don Thomes MacDougall reported that the seeds of morning glory flowers were used as sacraments by certain Zapotecs (sometimes in conjunction with the seeds of Rivea corymbosa, another species of morning glory which has a similar chemical composition, containing lysergol instead of LSA).

LSA was assayed for human activity by Albert Hofmann in self-trials in 1947 (well before it was known to be a natural compound). Intramuscular administration of a 500 microgram dose led to a tired, dreamy state with an inability to maintain clear thoughts. After a short period of sleep, the effects were gone and normal baseline was recovered within five hours. This suggests that the theory of LSA being the main psychedelic compound within morning glory seeds and Hawaiian baby woodrose is debatable as anecdotal reports suggest that the effects of synthetic LSA and iso-LSA are only slightly psychedelic in their effects and may well be triggered by a mixture of various lysergamides instead of one specific compound.

The LSA experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of LSA can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the body high of LSA can be described as a mild yet pleasurable, soft tingling sensation. This is largely noticed in high doses and is accompanied by strong waves of physical euphoria which are usually manifested spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the trip but can also maintain a consistent presence. In either case, they steadily rise with the onset and hit their limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - in terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, LSA tends to be sedating, however, it can be setting dependent. For example, when taken in settings with large amounts of stimulus or during physically strenuous activities such as walking, running, climbing or dancing it is fully capable of becoming stimulating and energetic. In contrast, however, when taken in calm environments such as darkened rooms with comfortable seating it is consistently relaxing, peaceful and quite sedating.
- **Vasoconstriction**

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of LSA is described by many as extremely relaxing yet lucid and clear headed in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or Psilocin. Although it is primarily sedating, it is accompanied by fast paced bursts of thought.

LSA contains a large number of psychedelic cognitive effects. The most prominent of these typical effects include:

- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Introspection**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion**
- **Direct communication with the subconscious**
- **Deja-Vu**

**Visual Effects:**

The visual effects of LSA are mostly present when large doses have been consumed.

*Enhancements*

LSA presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, these are significantly more simplistic from that of open eye distortions found with other psychedelics. Effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as mild but highly detailed yet cartoon-like in appearance. They are fast yet smooth in motion and fleeting in their permanence. This is an inconsistently manifested effect with some never reporting such distortions.
- **Colour shifting**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD or 2C-B. They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, zoomed out and small in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in their edges and rounded in their corners. They have a much more “natural” feel to them than LSD and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

LSA produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is very consistent when taken in large doses. The effects of such states include:

- **External hallucinations** - these are extremely common within LSA and partially follow the content of the user’s current thought process.
- **Internal hallucinations** - unlike LSD, LSA consistently produces moderate to high level hallucinatory states in high doses. This particular effect can be compared to a lucid dream state and commonly contains hallucinations with plots, settings, autonomous entity contact and scenarios. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively religious, spiritual, mystical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. These hallucinations are complemented by a powerful enhancement of the ability to visualize concepts. This ability eventually becomes so drawn out proportional to dosage that it leads to full blown hallucinatory states that are entirely lucid and for the most part controllable.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of LSA are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- Enhancements
- Distortions
- Hallucinations

**Natural Sources:**

**Morning Glory Seeds**

The seeds of many species of morning glory contain lysergamide alkaloids (including the psychedelic known as LSA). The seeds are found in many gardening stores, however, it’s worth noting that the seeds from commercial sources are often coated in some form of pesticide or methylmercury which can result in extreme nausea if ingested. Seeds without these pesticides can be purchased cheaply online and are freely available through search engines such as Google.

When using morning glory seeds, the dosage for oral consumption is generally considered to be:

- **Light** : *50 - 100 seeds* / *1.5 - 3 g*
- **Common** : *100 - 250 seeds */* 3 - 6 g*
- **Strong** : *250 - 400 seeds */* 6 - 10 g*
- **Heavy** : *400 + seeds */* 10 + g*

**Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds**

Hawaiian Baby Woodrose is a perennial climbing vine that is native to the Indian subcontinent and was introduced to numerous areas worldwide including Hawaii, Africa and the Caribbean. Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds may be consumed for their various lysergamide alkaloids such as LSA. These seeds are found in many gardening stores, however, the seeds from commercial sources are often coated in some form of pesticide or methylmercury which can result in extreme nausea if ingested. Seeds without these pesticides can be purchased cheaply online and are freely available through search engines such as Google.

When using morning glory seeds, the dosage for oral consumption is generally considered to be:

- **Threshold** : *1 - 4 seeds*
- **Light** : *3 - 6 seeds*
- **Common** : *5 - 8 seeds*
- **Strong** : *7 - 12 seeds*
- **Heavy** : *12 + seeds*

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

The toxic dosage of LSA is unknown as there has never been a single reported overdose. This suggests that LSA is perfectly safe to simply try on the odd occasion.

However, LSA should not be used on a frequent basis. When used repeatedly over a short period of time, the vasoconstriction effects build up while the psychoactive effects get weaker. If you’re feeling sore legs, this is a sign of the vasoconstriction effects building up in your body. The legs feel sore because not enough blood is getting to the muscles. Your upper leg muscles are the largest, most energy eating muscles in your body, and they will feel sore if blood flow to them is lowered even a little bit. If you’ve taken HBWR seeds, morning glory seeds, or pure LSA and are experiencing sore legs you need to hold off for a while. Let your body get back to baseline before using them again. This is more important with LSA (HBWR, morning glories, etc.). With LSA, it can take up to 3 days of abstinence to get back to baseline.

It’s important to note that LSA is non-habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to LSA after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing its full effects more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal Issues:**

- The consumption of LSA containing materials is prohibited under state legislation in most Australian states.
- LSA is not listed in Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances act and is therefore not illegal to possess. It is probably illegal to sell for human consumption as a drug, though the plants that contain it are not controlled in Canada.
- LSA is not legally classified as a drug, so consumption or possession of LSA or LSA containing-materials is not prohibited.
- LSA is controlled in the Netherlands. This makes it illegal to possess, distribute, and produce without a license.
- Chemical LSA is controlled as a drug in New Zealand. The plants and seeds of morning glory species are legal to possess, cultivate, buy, and distribute. Seeds are reportedly sprayed and warnings are included on the packets to not consume the seeds.
- The status of LSA as chemical is unknown, but LSA-containing plants appear to be uncontrolled in Poland.
- Sweden is planning to control a number of chemicals as of May 1, 2007 including LSA, 2C-T-4, DXM, and DOI.
- LSA is a Class A substance within the United Kingdom and categorized as a precursor to LSD (Misuse of Drugs Act 1971).

**Preparation Methods:**

LSA containing seeds can be prepared in a number of different ways. Click the links below for detailed step by step techniques.

- [Extraction of LSA tincture](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Extraction_of_LSA_tincture) - This extraction uses household chemicals such as naptha and ethanol to extract the LSA into a pure and nausea free liquid form. It is perfectly safe if performed correctly and can take between a few hours to several days depending on the desired potency.
- [Nausea free LSA extraction with garlic ](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_free_LSA_extraction)- This extraction uses cold tap water and a refrigerator to extract the LSA from the seeds and into a glass of water. It uses garlic to minimize the nausea and takes at least 4 hours in total.
- [LSA Adducts](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA_Adducts) - This preparation method is not an extraction and merely theoretical but based around well-reasoned chemistry and consistently themed anecdotal reports. It uses common household herbs such as peppermint and cinnamon bark essential oil to convert LSA into other substances with radically altered subjective effects including LSH and CDLSA.

**In Conclusion:**

The entirety of the LSA subjective effects breakdown for this particular article was not written by myself but the [PsychonautWiki](http://www.PsychonautWiki.org) admin known as [Cocoanatta](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/User:Cocoanatta). I have tried LSA myself on numerous occasions and can confirm that this article is indeed accurate.

As for the substance itself, although LSA is well known across the psychedelic community, this substance has a pretty bad reputation for causing painful states of nausea, vomiting and vasoconstriction despite the fact that this can be greatly reduced depending on the method of preparation. Alongside of this, LSA is also perceived as a substance which only causes very mild visual and cognitive effects in comparison to other more “classical” psychedelics.

This assumption however is simply untrue. LSA goes just as deep as LSD, mushrooms, ayahuasca or any other psychedelic and you simply need to find the right dosage and extract it correctly. This makes LSA an excellent choice for any psychonaut, especially when considering how cost effective and widely available the natural plant sources are.
