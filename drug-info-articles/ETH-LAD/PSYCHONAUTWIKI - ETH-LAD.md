**6-Ethyl-6- *nor* -lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **N-Ethyl- *nor* -lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide** , **N-Ethyl- *nor* -LSD** , and **ETH-LAD** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. ETH-LAD is chemically similar to LSD and has a similar mechanism of action, acting primarily by stimulating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

The human use of ETH-LAD was first documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is noted for its "modified visual distortion" relative to LSD. It has been marketed alongside psychedelic [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and commercially distributed through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

ETH-LAD has been shown to be moderately to significantly more potent than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself in animal studies with an active dose reported at between 40 and 100 micrograms. Anecdotal reports suggest that while it produces similar effects to LSD at low to common doses, it displays a notably divergent effects profile at higher doses, sometimes described as producing "algorithmic" and "warped" visual and [auditory distortions](/w/index.php?title=Auditory_distortions&action=edit&redlink=1) , combined with a more "introspective" and "analytical", if not more "neutral" head space.

ETH-LAD has also been reported to more readily produce adverse physical effects such as severe and persisting [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [temperature dysregulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression) , and generalized [bodily discomfort](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures) , particularly at higher doses. This has been speculated to owe itself to an unusually sensitive and unpredictable dose-response curve, as low to common dose experiences are generally described as being very manageable and non-threatening.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of ETH-LAD, and it has little history of human usage. Along with its sensitive dose-response and potentially concerning physical side effects, many reports suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

ETH-LAD, or 6-ethyl-6- *nor* -lysergic acid diethylamide, is a synthetic [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class. ETH-LAD is a structural analog of lysergic acid with an N,N-diethylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an indole derivative and has both overlapping tryptamine and phenethylamine skeletons embedded within its molecular structure (although it is principally classified as a tryptamine). ETH-LAD's structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group ( *nor* -lysergic acid).

ETH-LAD does not contain a methyl group substituted at R6 of its *nor-* lysergic acid skeleton as is the case with LSD; this is represented by the *nor-* prefix. Instead, ETH-LAD is substituted at R6 with an [ethyl](/w/index.php?title=Ethyl&action=edit&redlink=1) group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline, a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound in the same configuration of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

ETH-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R5 and R8. ETH-LAD, also called (+)-D-ETH-LAD, has an absolute configuration of (5R, 8R). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

As with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and other compounds in the lysergamide family, ETH-LAD likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from ETH-LAD's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors, although it is likely that like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , ETH-LAD also binds to a wide range of different receptors, including multiple different subtypes of serotonin receptors as well as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [adrenoreceptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) well. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

While the subjective effects of ETH-LAD are reported to largely overlap with those of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it has been noted for the tendency to be more visually and auditorily distortive, [introspective](/w/index.php?title=Introspective&action=edit&redlink=1) , [analytical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement) and [immersive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement) yet with the capacity to produce pronounced [discomforting physical effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Discomforting_physical_effects) like severe and persisting [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and temperature dysregulation past the common dose range in a seemingly unpredictable manner.

Due to its high potency and sensitive dose-response, many reports also indicate that the effects of this substance may be overly intense for those who are not already very experienced with psychedelics. Users are advised to approach this substance with caution, use a full array of [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) , and pay close attention to their physical conditions and environment if using this substance.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, ETH-LAD is regarded as being able to produce a spectrum of either predominantly stimulating or sedating effects, often alternating throughout the experience, sometimes to the point of feeling forced. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of ETH-LAD can be characterized as prominent in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. Like LSD, it can behave as a fast-moving, sharp and location specific or generalized tingling sensation, although this feeling is not necessarily pleasant and often manifests in a neutral way. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the experience, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached, which users tend to report as feeling "neutral", with the emphasis instead placed on alterations in the "head space". 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This component can occur with the development of spontaneous bodily sensations, but is not as consistent as it is with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and has more of a tendency to spontaneously produce mild to strong neutral if not uncomfortable physical sensations such as those that can be experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)** - This can manifest as either negative or pleasant bodily sensations capable of occurring anywhere, but particularly in the central areas of the body including the inner cavities like the chest or the lungs.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it may be pronounced in ETH-LAD. It is highly advised that users of this compound, especially at heavier doses, monitor their bodily temperature and use techniques like hot showers or cold packs to regulate their core and brain temperature throughout the experience, and to generally always maintain proximity to a climate-controlled environment. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - In comparison to traditional psychedelics, ETH-LAD has been noted for being able to produce nausea and other " [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) " type feelings more readily, potentially at any point during the experience but most prominently during the ["come up"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Coming_up) .
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This effect typically occurs either spontaneously, or on the comedown of higher doses than is thought the body can handle.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This is generally mild in comparison to traditional [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Users are advised to pay careful attention to both their water and electrolyte levels when taking ETH-LAD, being cautious to neither under nor over drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** or **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)** - While lysergamides are known for their interactions with the kidneys and bladder, ETH-LAD seems to affect it more so than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** - This effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this substance.
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** - This effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this substance.
- **[Gustatory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_hallucination)**
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)**
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and happens more readily than with related substances like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , perhaps owing to the greater degree of stimulation it produces.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an effect whose likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as states of dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. Although the extent to which this differs from the seizure risk posed by [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) is totally unknown, it is highly advised that users should always be prepared for the worst case scenario. ### Visual effects
 
- ETH-LAD is reported to produce a remarkable and unique range of visual effects that are often described as "synthetic", "digital", and highly complex in feeling. It has been noted for its capacity to produce profoundly complex [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic_visuals) , including higher level geometry, in a much more reliable and consistent manner than other members of the lysergamide family. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 
#### Enhancements
 
The effects listed below are generally considered more pronounced than they are for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) at equipotent doses.
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
The effects listed below are generally considered to be more pronounced than they are for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) at equipotent doses.
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )*
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Diffraction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diffraction)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on ETH-LAD can be generally described as more similar in appearance to that of [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, structured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it may almost consistently result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
ETH-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This effect is moderately more likely to occur than with LSD, particularly with strong to heavy doses. These machinescapes should not be confused for the ones commonly experienced on salvia however.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of ETH-LAD can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , ETH-LAD is often described as significantly more [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and fast-paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream(s) produced and contains a large number of potential effects. It should be noted that that higher doses appear to be readily capable of producing cognitive impairment and general sensory processing overload for reasons that are not currently understood. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect seems to be one of the uniquely pronounced features of this substance relative to other chemicals in its class. The kind of analysis enhancement experienced has drawn comparisons to the headspaces of drugs like [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , with a more emotionally neutral charge than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** - While this effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this compound until the heavy dose range is reached.
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this compound.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - These effects do not occur as commonly at low to moderate doses, particularly when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account, but can be overwhelming at higher doses. The negative sensations produced by this effect are seemingly more likely to manifest when the substance is combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Therefore, this combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves while taking only a fraction of their usual amount.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within one's internal narrative. It appears to be less prominent at low doses and more prominent at high doses compared to related lysergamides like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - This component and subcomponent may happen more readily and unpredictably than with other psychedelic compounds. For this reason, harm-reduction practices like having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) arranged beforehand when taking higher doses of this substance are highly advised. 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - This compound has been reported to produce more amnesic effects than LSD at higher doses.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - Some users have reported that the strong hallucinatory and memory suppressing effects of ETH-LAD at higher doses may lend itself more readily to states of confusion and disorientation than other psychedelics.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with ETH-LAD when it does occur.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This component has been reported to be particularly pronounced relative to other psychedelics.
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially likely to occur with this compound.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- Auditory effects are reported to be more pronounced with ETH-LAD than for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . ETH-LAD has been noted for the sheer depth and range of auditory hallucinations and alterations it is capable of producing, for reasons that are yet poorly understood. 
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** - The audio hallucinations produced by ETH-LAD seem to be more prominent compared to many other psychedelics. The reasons are not yet understood, but those who use this substance are advised to be prepared for the uncontrollable auditory hallucinations it can produce.
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - This effect is uniquely pronounced relative to other members of the lysergamide family. At doses above the common dose, they are liable to either be neutral if not mildly disturbing or intriguing. ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - Many reports suggest that this substance is especially reliable at inducing synaesthetic states in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ETH-LAD use in humans does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because ETH-LAD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried ETH-LAD suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (although nothing can be guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

ETH-LAD is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. As with most psychedelics, it is generally considered to have a built-in, self-regulating aspect to it, although cases of its abuse have been reported. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Tolerance to the effects of ETH-LAD builds almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ETH-LAD presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of ETH-LAD all psychedelics will display a reduced effect.

### Overdose

While ETH-LAD has no known toxic dosage, many anecdotal reports suggest this compound to be harsher to handle in overdoses when compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or other [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) . Overdose effects can already start in the heavy dose range and are described as being particularly uncomfortable and bizarre. Some of these effects include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , severe [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and body load, and more rarely [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed if suspected of severe psychotic episodes or [“fake acid”](/w/index.php?title=Fake_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the negative cognitive effects.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of ETH-LAD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.

## Legal status

ETH-LAD is currently a gray area compound within many parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within most countries. People may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws (as an analogue of LSD) and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : ETH-LAD is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : ETH-LAD is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Latvia** : ETH-LAD is illegal in Latvia. Although ETH-LAD is not officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Poland** : ETH-LAD is a NPS class drug in Poland, making it illegal to possess or distribute.
- **Switzerland** : ETH-LAD is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E. . It is scheduled as of the of December 1, 2015.
- **Turkey:** ETH-LAD is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : As of January 7, 2015, ETH-LAD is specifically named in the U.K. Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class A controlled substance.
- **United States** : ETH-LAD is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) (which is a Schedule I compound under the Controlled Substances Act). As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific research could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.
