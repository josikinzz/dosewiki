## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 25 μg
- Light: 2 - 3 mg
- Common: 4 - 5 mg
- Strong: 6 - 8 mg
- Heavy: 8 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 2 - 6 hours
- Onset: 15 - 45 minutes
- Peak: 60 - 120 minutes
**Tizanidine can induce dangerously low blood pressures when used in excessive doses**
 
Care should be taken when taking high doses of tizanidine, **even with an established tolerance** . Users taking hallucinogenic doses should have a hypertensive agent available or a supervisor present. Exercise extreme caution when attempting hallucinogenic doses.
**Tizanidine** (known by the trade names **Zanaflex** and **Trinex** among others) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the imidazoline class closely related to [clonidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Clonidine) . Tizanidine is primarily used primarily as an antispasmodic drug. Tizanidine's effectivness is similar to that of [baclofen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Baclofen) or [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) .

Tizanidine is a central α 2 adrenergic agonist. The relationship between the α 2 receptor agonism and the spasmolytic function of tizanidine is not fully understood .

While recreational use is extremely rare, some users take tizanidine for its standalone sedative effects or to potentiate the effects of [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates)    . In higher doses, tizanidine is capable of inducing [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)   .

## Chemistry

Tizanidine is 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole substituted at C-4 by a Delta(1)-imidazolin-2-ylamino group and at C-4 by a chloro group. It is an agonist at α 2 -adrenergic receptor sites. It is a benzothiadiazole and a member of imidazoles .

## Pharmacology

Tizanidine is an [imidazoline](/w/index.php?title=Imidazoline&action=edit&redlink=1) derivative and centrally acting α 2 [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) closely related to Clonidine. Tizanidine inhibits the release of excitatory amino acids from spinal interneurons. As a result, Tizanidine enhances the presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons .

Tizanidine also has some affinity for the α 1 receptors, but to a lesser than Clonidine, which may explain why its cardiovascular effects are so much milder than that of Clonidine . Tizanidine has approximately one tenth to one fifteenth of the blood pressure lowering effect of clonidine .

Tizanidine has also been found to have [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) effects against strychnine-induced seizures but not against [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) -induced seizures. The α 2 receptor mediated inhibition of inter-neuronal activity appears to be the cause of Tizanidine's anti-convulsant properties .

Tizanidine has an oral bioavailability of 20-34% and an elimination half-life of 2.5 hours. It attains steady-state concentration within 24-48 hours after administration

The table below compares the selectivity of Tizanidine and other drugs to the imidzaoline-receptor and the α 2 receptors in rats. Tizanidine has a significantly greater selectivity to the imidazoline receptor than clonidine. The imidazoline receptor selectivity of tizanidine may be responsible for its unique pharmacological profile .

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** - Tizanidine has been found to suppress strycnine induced seizures, but not GABA induced seizures.
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Tizanidine can produce a strong sedative effect. Users can become very tired and sleep through stimuli that would otherwise wake them.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This effect is very mild and may not be pronounced at all in some users.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - It only occurs at higher doses as a result of low blood pressure and mostly at lips.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Because of the cardiovascular effects of Tizanidine, users can become dizzy or lightheaded.
- **[Headache](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headache)** - When taking excessive doses, headaches are a common side effect.
- **[Watery eyes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Watery_eyes)**
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression)** - This effect typically presents itself at higher doses.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
- **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)**
 
#### Geometry
 
At high doses, geometry can be observed likely due to experiencing low blood pressure and circulation to the brain. The geometry is distinct from psychedelic and dissociative drugs. It can be described as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit, multicolored in scheme, flat in shading, soft in edges, smooth in motion, slow in speed, small in size, angular in corners, non-immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity.
 
The geometry of Tizanidine never exceeds level 4. The doses required to observe such geometries can induce dangerously low blood pressures and cause one to lose consciousness . Users should exercise caution when taking hallucinogenic doses, as the threshold for hallucinations is not far from the threshold for psychosis in many users .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
In higher doses, Tizanidine is capable of inducing a delirious state.
 
- **[Scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Some users of tizanidine notice strange or increasingly vivid dreams after continuous use of tizanidine.
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - This effect occurs at higher doses
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** - At extremely high doses, delirium can be induced.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - This is the most prevalent cognitive effect of Tizanidine ### After effects
 
- - **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to tizanidine's cardiovascular effects and typically presents itself after prolonged use.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This occurs as a rebound effect to tizanidine's cardiovascular effects and typically presents itself after prolonged use.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Soreness](/w/index.php?title=Soreness&action=edit&redlink=1)** - After the effects of tizanidine wear off, muscles that weren't sore before using the drug can become sore with more ease. For most users, this first presents itself as an increased soreness in the neck.

## Toxicity and harm potential

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

While no long term studies of tizanidine use in humans have been done, studies done in animals indicate no signs of long term carcinogenicity. However, tizanidine has been shown to have a developmental effect on young rats .

Some long term tizanidine use has been attributed to liver problems and in extreme cases, liver failure and death .

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of oral tizanidine in rats was found to be 414mg/kg in rats and 235 mg/kg in mice .

In some cases, Tizanidine overdose can be reversed with naloxone; however, this is not the case with everyone .

### Tolerance and addiction potential

While dependence is rare, use of Tizanidine exceeding 36mg daily over an extended period of time can lead to hypertensive withdrawals. In cases where dependence has been built, a user should taper to avoid a hypertensive crisis .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **Stimulants** - Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.
