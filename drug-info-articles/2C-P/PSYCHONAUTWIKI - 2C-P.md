## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 1 mg
- Light: 2 - 6 mg
- Common: 6 - 10 mg
- Strong: 10 - 16 mg
- Heavy: 16 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 10 - 20 hours
- Onset: 1 - 3 hours
- Come up: 2 - 4 hours
- Peak: 4 - 8 hours
- Offset: 3 - 6 hours
- After effects: 8 - 48 hours
**2C-P is very difficult to dose properly.**
 
Due to its unusually slow onset, long duration, and steep dose-response curve, it is strongly discouraged to re-dose 2C-P earlier than every 3 hours to a total of 2 milligrams above a previously evaluated dose. Also, even for experienced trippers, it is advised to not go above a *common* dose for the first time (see dosage table) per 70 kg body weight, as the session will last for several times longer compared to most psychedelics. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-propylphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-P** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. 2C-P is a relatively obscure member of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of psychedelic phenethylamines, which are closely related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . It is known as one of the most potent, dose-sensitive, and long-lasting of the series. Although the precise mechanism is not known, it is thought to produce its psychoactive effects by activating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in parts of the brain.

2C-P was first synthesized and tested for human activity by the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who documented his findings in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). The reports found in the 2C-P PiHKAL entry remark on its depth and long onset and duration of action, with the commentary section describing 16 mg as a clear overdose with "physical consequences." The commentary also notes the small window separating an adequate dose from an excessive dose, suggesting it is relatively easy to overdose on.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports tend to characterize the effects of 2C-P in terms of its unusually long duration, powerful, sometimes overwhelming visuals, and intense "body load" consisting of [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [muscle tension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_tension) , and general bodily discomfort. Some reports suggest it may be easier to experience agitation and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) on 2C-P than other 2C's, perhaps owing to the ease in which it can be mis-dosed. As a result, it is considered to have an unfavorable safety profile among psychedelics.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-P. Due its powerful effects and unusually long duration, 2C-P may be overly intense and difficult to use safely for those who are not highly experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance. These include avoiding "eye-balling" (i.e. measuring the dose with the naked eye instead of a reliable milligram scale) and non-oral [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . [Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) is commonly recommended when dealing with substances of this potency.

## Chemistry

2C-P or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-propylphenethylamine is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-P contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 and a propyl chain attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-P belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-P is a relatively potent and long acting psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family which possesses stimulant type effects as well. It was first described by Alexander Shulgin in his book *[PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL)* .

2C-P has been shown to produce a variety of intense [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) type effects ranging from drastic changes in consciousness and perception, to open and closed eye visuals. 2C-P is considered to be one of the strongest 2C-x compounds dosage for dosage, rivaled only by 2C-TFM.

2C-P's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how it results in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

2C-P's head space and visuals have been described as possessing more similarities to alkylated 2C's like [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than halogenated members like [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) .

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-P is considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is comparable to that of [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and other substances within the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family, being encouraged instead of forced.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - In comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , the "body high" of 2C-P can be considered as mild although still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. It is similar yet distinct from the "body high" experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is coupled by an equally intense yet slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body as well as a slight warm glow that manifests itself much less consistently than the other two physical components. All of these are capable of becoming very physically euphoric.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This effect is particularly prominent but capable of going in both pleasurable and uncomfortable directions. This can result in pleasurable tactile sensations but also enhances bodily aches and pains which one may not have previously been aware of to the point of extreme discomfort.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - 2C-P is reported to be able to cause large perceived increases and decreases in temperature in a dose dependent manner. This can become extremely uncomfortable if not dangerous at larger doses due to the fever-like delirium that is sometimes reported. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - A common theme found in many 2C-P reports is the way in which it can heighten and enhance sexual arousal. When experienced, this sensation is not overwhelming or out of control but simply remains something that the user is constantly aware of. If sexual activities of any kind are engaged in, they are have been reported to be immensely more pleasurable than anything that can be achieved in a sober state.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - A very common effect of 2C-P, and more pronounced with 2C-P than other 2C's or psychedelic substances in general. Can become very uncomfortable, especially with higher doses. ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Color shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry present can be described as being more similar in appearance to that of [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocetin) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . They can be comprehensively described as structured in their organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in their edges and equally rounded and angular in their corners. It gives off a contradictory natural and synthetic feel that at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) . There seems to be visual geometry that is distinct from [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and can be described as faster moving and more intense in proportion to cognitive and physical effects than [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
2C-P produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. This holds particularly true in comparison to other 2C-x [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) or [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . These effects include:
 
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 2C-P is extremely high in hallucinations embedded within visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) . This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[Unspeakable horrors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unspeakable_horrors)** - This is an effect that is typically associated with [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) rather than [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Based on anecdotal reports, they only tend to occur at higher doses and are likely a result of the pronounced temperature increasing properties this substance has compared to other [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which can lend readily to [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) -like states. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 2C-P have been described as both insightful and relatively normal in their thought processes up to moderate dosages, after which their confusing, and disorienting effects can increase considerably.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-P use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-P is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose
**2C-P is difficult to dose properly, and requires patience. Be aware that impulsive overdosing can lead to an overdose. Please structure a calculated dosage regimen and stick to it.**
 
- 2C-P has a **steep dose-response curve** : As little as a few extra milligrams separating a manageable dose and an overdose. Users who wish to take high doses of this compound are advised to titrate upward slowly, use reliable milligram scales to measure doses, and avoid non-oral routes of administration such as insufflation or injection.
- 2C-P has a **very slow onset** : The peak effects reportedly do not occur for 1 to 3 hours. Thus it's advised to wait for *at least* 3 hours before re-dosing is considered, and even longer for full stomach content.
- 2C-P has a **very long half-life** : The anecdotal estimated elimination half-life is 19 hours.
The LD 50 of 2C-P has not been established. However, it is believed that 2C-P is likely to have a smaller therapeutic window compared to other 2C's, meaning a lethal dose may be achieved more easily.

In 2017, a 25-year old British female died following the ingestion of a large dose of 2C-P at a music festival. No source reported clear evidence that 2C-P by itself led to the immediate death of the female.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As a [serotonergic psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) , 2C-P is considered to have a low potential for abuse and dependence.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-P is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-P produces cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-P all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-P. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

2C-P is not scheduled under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances. It is considered to exist in a legal grey area in many countries, meaning that while it is not specifically illegal, individuals may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : 2C-P is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). In its Schedule II, the further specifying NPSV (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Verordnung Österreich) explicitly bans all substituted phenetylamines.
- **Canada** : 2C-P would be considered Schedule III as it is a derivative of 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine.
- **China** : As of October 2015, 2C-P is a controlled substance in China.
- **Denmark** : 2C-P is on the list of Schedule B controlled substances.
- **Germany** : 2C-P is controlled under Anlage I BtMG ( *Narcotics Act, Schedule I* ) as of December 13, 2014. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, import, export, buy, sell, procure or dispense it without a license.
- **Japan** : 2C-P is a controlled substance in Japan effective March 25th, 2015.
- **Latvia** : 2C-P is a Schedule I controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : 2C-P is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **Turkey:** 2C-P is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **The Netherlands:** 2C-P is currently legal, but it is part of a substance group that may be banned soon as part of a recently passed law on New Psychoactive Substances (NPS).
- **United Kingdom** : 2C-P is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the phenethylamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 2C-P is a Schedule I controlled substance. This means 2C-P is illegal to manufacture, buy, possess, process, or distribute without a license from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
