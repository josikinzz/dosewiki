## Subjective Experience

3-FPM is an analogue of phenmetrazine, which was allegedly used by The Beatles in
Hamburg as a functional aid, to enable them to perform for excessively long hours.
Whilst phenmetrazine disappeared from the market over time, 3-FPM emerged late
in 2014, sold via online vendors and sourced, presumably, from Chinese labs. It
gained a reasonable amount of traction over a relatively short period of time.

I sampled it on a number of occasions, writing on forums over several months. My
contributions amounted to the following (edited for continuity):

\`\`\`
Well, that was a nice little experience. I consumed this orally as a series of
50mg doses, to test the water. This produced a mild buzz, confirming other
observations what we are probably talking 100mg+ for the full effect, at least
via this RoA.
\`\`\`

And:

\`\`\`
I insufflated over the course of the evening. The intensity gradually increased
to produce an extremely nice ride, although I was still generally functional if I
needed to be.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Interestingly, whilst not pleasant, I didn't find insufflation to be so terrible.
Certainly, my last snorting exercise, with kanna, was much more problematic.
This lack of discomfort could have been mitigated by the fact that I had
consumed a small amount orally beforehand, but I was expecting far worse.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Less positive news came with residue stim. I was awake until around 1am, at
which point I popped 1mg of Etizolam. This did the trick, and I slept like a
baby.
\`\`\`
The upshot of what I now consider to be reckless dosing was that this provided a
fairly pleasant experience. However, my final post described another side to the coin:

\`\`\`
The thread on this substance is extraordinary. I was one of the early jumpers
and was as enthusiastic as anyone. It seemed to be nice and clean, and was
certainly the source of an enjoyable buzz. However, it soon became obvious
that there was a ceiling, and that I was consuming increasing amounts to get
beyond it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
This was a red light for me, so I stopped after a few sessions.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I had cold and flu-like symptoms over Christmas, but although I suspect it was
implicated, I can't pin it on this chemical with any certainty. What I definitely
experienced was increasing body load, and lower returns in terms of reward.
This got to the point where the positive effects were simply not worth the
aftermath.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The reports of illness and other reactions are alarming. It really is so easy to
fall into the redosing trap with this one, even for experienced researchers who
should know better.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Take it easy.
\`\`\`
During the following months claims emerged that 3-FPM was the cause of
inflammation and that it had detrimental effects upon the immune system. Certainly,
it seemed to linger in the body longer than most.

I never returned to this following these early tests. Functionally, there were better
options available, and recreationally I felt no inclination to take undue risks.

Notwithstanding the above, at one point this was one of the most popular legal
stimulants on the market.

**3-Fluorophenmetrazine** (also known as **3F-Phenmetrazine** , **PAL-593** , and **3-FPM** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [phenylmorpholine](/w/index.php?title=Phenylmorpholine&action=edit&redlink=1) class. 3-FPM is a derivative of [phenmetrazine](/w/index.php?title=Phenmetrazine&action=edit&redlink=1) , a once-popular stimulant substance that was clinically used as an anorectic in Europe in the 1950s. It produces its activity by increasing the levels of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

The synthesis and pharmacology of 3-FPM was first reported in a patent filed in 2011. Reports of human use first surfaced in early 2015 after it appeared for sale on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [enhanced focus](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) and [motivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Users commonly report that 3-FPM produces classical stimulant effects comparable to those of amphetamine. Many reports describe 3-FPM as having a relatively subtle and controlled stimulant effect which produces less nervousness, insomnia and euphoria than other stimulants, which makes it suitable as a study-aid or productivity-enhancer. A few but significant number of anecdotal reports indicate some people experience serious nervous system reactions to 3-FPM .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3-FPM. Due to the lack of information on its properties, it is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3-Fluorophenmetrazine (3-FPM) is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. 3-FPM contains a fluorine atom attached at R 3 of the phenyl ring. Additionally, part of its amphetamine skeleton is incorporated into a morpholine ring. At R 2 of its chain, an oxygen group is bound -- this oxygen group is linked by an ethyl chain to the terminal amine of the amphetamine chain to form a morpholine group. 3-FPM is a fluorinated derivative of [phenmetrazine](/w/index.php?title=Phenmetrazine&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

3-FPM is a sympathomimetic drug which has classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects when consumed. Its mechanism of action appears to function by acting as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , increasing their concentrations in the synaptic clefts of neurons in the brain. This accumulation of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) results in the experience of [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) effects. Its parent compound, phenmetrazine, was previously marketed as an [appetite suppressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppressant) in the 60s and 70s but has since been withdrawn from the market due to concerns of abuse and addiction.

Below is a table showing 3-FPM's potency for inducing release (EC50) of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) (DA), [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) (5-HT) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) (NE) in comparison to phenmetrazine:

## Subjective effects

According to anecdotal reports, 3-FPM is considered to be more subtle in its effects when compared to other stimulants and produces less [nervousness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) than substances of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class, leading to its adoption as a study and productivity-enhancing drug as opposed to the more typical recreational stimulant with pronounced [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) properties.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 3-FPM is usually considered to be mildly to moderately energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is considerably weaker in comparison to that of traditional recreational stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) . This encourages physical activities such as performing chores and repetitive tasks which would otherwise be boring and strenuous physical activities.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - In comparison to other stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , 3-FPM only has a mild effect on one's heart rate. This effect may be more pronounced with higher doses aswell with redosing.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - The above components are also accompanied by a suppression of appetite which is usually much less intense in strength in comparison to the appetite suppression experienced with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - 3-FPM is known for having aphrodisiac properties and is said to enhance sex drive and improve sexual performance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** - 3-FPM is known for increasing sexual activity. But while being a CNS stimulant vasoconstriction that occurs with stimulants can make sexual activity more strenuous [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and many other stimulants. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - While 3-FPM is often noted for its potential functional applications, higher doses can result in the kind of disinhibition seen in traditional stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , leading to increased sociability.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This component is much less intense than the euphoria experienced with other stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) .
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate doses as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)** - This component is experienced in a functional form even at moderate to high doses.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- Although many report 3-FPM to have minor comedowns, many also report redosing can produce moderate to full on of the effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of 3-FPM are usually less consistent and only mildly noticeable at higher dosages and sleep deprivation. They are somewhat comparable to deliriants and occur more readily in darker areas. Visual effects include: 
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - People often report an increase of Brightness on 3-FPM in their subjective experiences. Based on anecdotal reports

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-FPM use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-FPM has very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that 3-FPM is relatively well-tolerated, with most users encountering few side-effects at low to moderate doses. However, several users have encountered serious flu-like symptoms on the comedown of 3-FPM, consisting of muscle and joint aches, fever and chills, and headaches, sometimes with migraine auras present. This is speculated to be systemic inflammation induced by 3-FPM. Therefore new users should exercise great caution in dosing to gauge their own physiological response to 3-FPM. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of 3-FPM can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-FPM develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-FPM presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-FPM all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with 3-FPM should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - 3-FPM may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/3-fluorophenmetrazine-3-fpm/*

3-Fluorophenmetrazine (3-FPM) is a substituted amphetamine that’s similar to phenmetrazine, a stimulant which was used for weight loss decades ago. 3-FPM has only been used since 2014.

It provides relatively moderate effects and is more of a productive stimulant than a recreational one. A limit on its positive effects has been noted, so the drug usually doesn’t provide notably better effects at strong+ doses.

Due to a lack of information about the substance, it’s hard to say how safe it is, especially with long-term use. Common doses don’t appear acutely dangerous for healthy people. No deaths have been reported.

  "wikipedia": `# 3-Fluorophenmetrazine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Fluorophenmetrazine*

3-Fluorophenmetrazine  (also known as 3-FPM, 3-FPH and PAL-593) is a phenylmorpholine-based stimulant and fluorinated analogue of phenmetrazine that has been sold online as a designer drug.

## Chemistry

3-Fluorophenmetrazine is a fluorinated analogue of phenmetrazine, a stimulant of the morpholine class.
3-Fluorophenmetrazine is a regioisomer of both 2-fluorophenmetrazine and 4-fluorophenmetrazine.

## Pharmacology

3-FPM acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent with EC50 values of 30 nM and 43 nM, respectively. It shows only negligible efficacy as a releaser of serotonin, with an EC50 value of 2558 nM.
3-FPM also inhibits uptake mediated by dopamine transporters and norepinephrine transporters in HEK293 cells with potencies comparable to cocaine (IC50 values <2.5 μM), but with less potent effects at serotonin transporters (IC50 values >80 μM).
At sufficient doses, 3-FPM is capable of  reversing monoamine transporters, particularly transporters of the catecholamines dopamine and norepinephrine, and, to a much lesser degree, serotonin transporters, thereby releasing these neurotransmitters from the cytosol into the extracellular space, where they are active.
Evaluation of its metabolic pathway revealed N-oxidation, aryl hydroxylation and subsequent O-methylation, alkyl hydroxylation, oxidation, and degradation of the ethyl-bridge yielding the O/N-bis-dealkylated metabolite, combinations thereof and further glucuronidation or sulfations.

## Legality

In the United States, 3-fluorophenmetrazine is not explicitly illegal at the federal level, but may be considered under the federal analogue act if intended for consumption as a structural analog of the Schedule II drug Phenmetrazine, but only if intended for human consumption.
On November 16, 2016, it became an illegal substance in the state of Virginia. As of 2019, it is also a schedule I substance in Virginia. The positional isomers of 3-fluorophenmetrazine such as 2-fluorophenmetrazine and 4-fluorophenmetrazine are also illegal under Virginia law, but not federal law.
Sweden's public health agency suggested to classify 3-Fluorophenmetrazine as illegal narcotic on June 1, 2015. It was finally classified on October 15, 2015.
3-Fluorophenmetrazine is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015.
