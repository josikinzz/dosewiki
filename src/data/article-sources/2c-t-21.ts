U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-T-21**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Possible Analog
 
2C-T-21 is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of 2C-T-7), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) . 
 
 
In 2004 [several cases](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) related to research chemicals were pending in U.S. federal court. A chemical supplier was federally charged in fall of 2004 with intent to distribute "2C-T-2 1 [2,5-Dimethoxy-4- (2-fluoroethylthio)Phenethylamine HCL],...controlled substance analogues as defined by Title 21, United States Code, Section 802(32)(A), knowing that the substances were intended for human consumption." -- [See indictment of American Chemical Supply](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_law2.shtml) . On March 21, 2005, Burton plead guilty to Count One of the indictment. See [DEA press release about subsequent sentencing](http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/lam/press/press0510.html#burton) . We are unaware of any cases against individuals for possession alone (10/2/2006).

*PiHKAL Entry #49*


## SYNTHESIS
A mixture of 26.8 g POCl3 and 24.8 g N-methylformanilide was heated for 10 min on the steam bath. To this claret-colored solution was added 17.0 g of 2,5- dimethoxyphenyl 2-fluoroethyl sulfide, and the mixture heated an additional 25 min on the steam bath. This was then added to 1.5 L of well-stirred warm H2O (pre-heated to 55 Â°C) and the oily phase that formed solidified almost immediately. This brown sugar-like product was removed by filtration, and washed with additional H2O. After sucking as dry as possible, the residual solids (weighing 19.0 g wet) were dissolved in an equal weight of boiling MeOH which, after cooling in an ice-bath, deposited pale ivory colored crystals of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)benzaldehyde. This was air dried to constant weight, which was 15.1 g.

To a solution of 15.0 g 2,5-dimethoxy-(2-fluoroethylthio)benzaldehyde in 75 mL nitromethane there was added 1.35 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate, and the mixture was heated on the steam bath for 70 min (the progress of the reaction must be followed by continuous TLC monitoring). The clear deeply-colored solution was decanted from some insoluble material and the excess nitromethane removed under vacuum. There resulted 17.78 g of almost dry brick-red crystals which were dissolved in 110 mL boiling EtOAc. After cooling overnight in the refrigerator, the crystalline product was removed, washed with EtOAc, and air dried. There was obtained 14.33 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)-Î²-nitrostyrene as bright orange crystals.

A solution of LAH (140 mL of a 1 M solution in THF) was cooled, under He, to 0 Â°C with an external ice bath. With good stirring there was added 3.7 mL 100% H2SO4 dropwise, to minimize charring. This was followed by the addition of 8.9 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)-Î²-nitrostyrene in 40 mL of hot anhydrous THF (a heat lamp was needed to keep the nitrostyrene in solution). As the nitrostyrene entered the hydride solution, there was an immediate loss of color. After 1 h stirring at room temperature, the temperature was brought up to a gentle reflux on the steam bath, then all was cooled again to 0 Â°C. The excess hydride was destroyed by the cautious addition of 15 mL IPA and the inorganic solids were made white and filterable by the addition of 15 mL 15% NaOH. The loose cottage-cheesy solids were removed by filtration, and washed with additional THF. The filtrate and washes were pooled and stripped of solvent under vacuum providing 7.39 g of a pale amber oil. This was dissolved in 600 mL dilute H2SO4, and washed with 3Ã50 mL CH2Cl2 (which removed the light yellow color). The aqueous phase was made strongly basic with 25% NaOH, extracted with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 and, after pooling, the solvent was removed under vacuum leaving 4.91 g of product as an oil. This was distilled at 145â160 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg giving 3.91 g of a white oil. This was dissolved in 40 mL IPA and neutralized with 35 drops of concentrated HCl. The beautiful white solids that formed were removed by filtration, and washed with IPA. All were suspended in, and ground under, 40 mL anhydrous Et2O, refiltered and air dried. The final weight of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)phenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-T-21) was 4.07 g of glistening white crystals.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 8 mg) âComes on very gradually and slowly. Takes about an hour to feel. Reasonably intense in two hours, ++. Very pleasant material, enhancing communication, clear thinking, good feeling. There is a feeling of closeness; the bondedness with the group grows steadily during the day, reaching a highly rewarding level. For me a couple of firsts regarding food. I was hungry only two hours into it. I usually donât want food âtil well down as I usually feel that it interferes with the experience. And, also, I nibbled constantly as I felt that there was nothing in my body. And I enjoyed it thoroughly, feeling only the warmth and energy, with no contrary developments. There was a nice feeling of inner strength and peace.â

(with 8 mg) âIt was very difficult to fix the times of ascent or descent. Some chilling during onset but not later. And there was some yawning and ear-popping. It is easy on the body, in no way threatening. This time I am very relaxed and somewhat lethargic; the visuals are not too pronounced. Excellent sleep.â

(with 10 mg) âI find I can use it if I set my energy in a direction I really want to go in. Otherwise I can just be stoned and self-indulgent. Not out-of-body cosmic at all. But itâs good material, an ally, not presenting hidden negatives.â

(with 12 mg) âWell â¦ 12 milligrams is quite enough for a +3, which was established within the first hour and plateauâd by the end of the second. Body felt quite safe, again, but there was considerable push of energy. I did not feel particularly interested in doing anything like writing and in fact preferred to watch television while rocking a bit on the couch, to ease the push. Mood was faintly grim, but not more than faintly. I noted something that I hadnât seen before with this material: time slowing. The first two hours seemed to last a very long time. There was no anorexia. It wasnât until 10 p.m. [fifth hour] that the idea of writing had any appeal at all. By then, I was still +3 but a lot more at ease. I wrote two letters and enjoyed the process. Sleep was fine. My mood next day was slightly introverted, not very spontaneous for a while. Late in the afternoon, it was a lot better.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A logical extension of 2C-T-21 is the three carbon amphetamine analogue which should be, by comparing structures and activities, a very potent and interesting material in its own rights. This would be 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)amphetamine or, following the nomenclature used with the earlier members of this series, ALEPH-21. A solution of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)benzaldehyde (see earlier in this recipe) in nitroethane with ammonium acetate gave 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2-fluoroethylthio)phenyl)-2-nitropropene as yellow-orange crystals from MeOH with a melting point of 102â104 Â°C. And that is where the project now stands. It has not yet been reduced to the amine.

This phenethylamine, 2C-T-21, was the last of the 2C-Tâs to be completed. A couple of other sulfur analogues have been given numbers, and have been started, but the syntheses are still at some intermediate state.

The n-butyl compound, named 2C-T-19, has been taken to the nitrostyrene stage. Reaction between 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and n-butylbromide with KOH gave 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl n-butyl sulfide as a colorless oil. This, with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide, provided 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)benzaldehyde as pale orange solids from MeOH, with a melting point of 78â79 Â°C. This, with nitromethane and ammonium acetate, gave 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(n-butylthio)-Î²-nitrostyrene, with a melting point of 133â134 Â°C from either IPA or acetonitrile.

The 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl compound, which I have named 2C-T-22, has been taken to the benzaldehyde stage. Reaction between 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyliodide with KOH gives 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl sulfide as a very pale amber oil. This, with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide provided 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzaldehyde as crystals that proved to be exceedingly difficult to purify. Yellow solids can be obtained from several solvents, and they melt in the 70 Â°C area. The initially isolated fraction melted at 69â72 Â°C and showed three major spots by both TLC and GCMS. The largest GC peak was the correct product with a parent peak of 280 m/e, and cracking fragments at 154 and 234 m/e. A small sample was finally obtained from hexane with a melting point of 78â79 Â°C but I am not sure that even it is particularly pure. Not surprisingly, the reaction of this crude benzaldehyde with nitromethane and ammonium acetate gave a nitrostyrene product that was a complex mixture. And there that project also rests.

A couple of additional efforts warrant comment. The reaction between trifluoromethyliodide and 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol should have produced 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl trifluoromethyl sulfide, but it didnât produce anything. And one more. What about a bare thio group at the 4-position in this 2C-T-family? Maybe this can be protected through everything as the disulfide, and be reduced at the last step! The disulfide, 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl disulfide (see under 2C-T-15) was aimed towards the needed bis-aldehyde with phosphorus oxychloride and N-methylformanilide, but all that came out of this were black oils and tars. This has also been abandoned for now.

And it has just occurred to me that there is yet another effort that is certainly worth making, inspired by the observation that 2,2-difluoroethyl iodide is commercially available and not prohibitively expensive. It, with 2,5-dimethoxythiophenol, and following the obvious steps to the aldehyde, the nitrostyrene, and the final amine, would produce 2,5-dimethoxy-4-(2,2-difluoroethylthio)phenethylamine hydrochloride. It lies exactly half way between the highly potent 2C-T-21 (the mono-fluoro), and the yet to be finished 2C-T-22 (the trifluoro). Letâs be weird, and call it 2C-T-21.5. I will wager mucho that it will be very potent.

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-ethylfluorothiophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-T-21** , or colloquially as **Aurora** ) is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-T-21 was first synthesized by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and documented in his book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). The dosage range is listed as 8–12 mg. It is described in various reports as being generally relaxed and clear-headed with mild visual effects. In *Thanatos To Eros, 35 Years of Psychedelic Exploration* , Myron Stolaroff describes it as "not psychedelic, but a wonderful energizer", along with displaying a notable lack of [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) typically observed with members of its class. However he also mentions concerns regarding toxicity.

In March 2004, a 22-year-old American male died after ingesting an unknown amount of 2C-T-21. This death became part of a two-year DEA investigation called "Operation Web Tryp" which ended with the arrests of 10 persons involved in the online distribution of [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) . 2C-T-21 remains unscheduled in the United States.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-T-21, although a paper by Daniel Trachsel hypothesizes that one of its metabolites is the poison [fluoroacetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoroacetate) . It has little history of human usage. It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2C-T-21, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylfluorothiophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-T-21 contain methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 of the benzene ring as well as an ethylfluoro thioether group attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-T-21 belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines, all of which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-T-21's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

This compound, being similar in structure to [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) is also believed to potentially have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) properties.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2C-T-21 is generally considered to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion is comparable to that of other [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) such as [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-P](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-P) . However, at certain doses and contexts, it may produce periods of notable [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) .
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-T-21 is intense, but in comparison to [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , it can be considered mild though is still capable of becoming very powerful and highly physically euphoric. The sensation itself can be described as intense and will manifest itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 2C-T-21](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_2CT21.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

On March 9, 2004, a 22-year-old American male consumed an unknown dose of 2C-T-21 by sticking his tongue into a vial of powder he had purchased online. He developed a temperature of 108 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius), had a tonic-clonic seizure, and slipped into a coma before dying four days later. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] These symptoms are consistent with those seen in fluoroacetate poisoning, for which there is no known effective antidote.

Fluoroacetate is hypothesized to be a metabolite of 2C-T-21. Sub-lethal doses of fluoroacetate take up to four days to clear from the body. As such, it is likely dangerous to take 2C-T-21 multiple days in a row as this poisonous metabolite will accumulate. Furthermore, sub-lethal doses may cause damage to tissue with high energy needs (e.g. the brain, gonads, heart, lungs, and fetus). This may account for the experience of a couple who became "convinced that it is toxic" in Stolaroff's book.

There is no anecdotal evidence to suggest that a single, moderate dose of 2C-T-21 can cause negative health effects, although nothing can be guaranteed.

It is strongly discouraged to administer 2C-T-21 non-orally because this may cause vomiting, numerous negative side effects, or death at high doses.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

2C-T-21 is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-T-21 is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-T-21 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-T-21 all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

If 2C-T-21 does have [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) effects as commonly speculated, this could indicate that 2C-T-21 is more likely to induce [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) or general [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) overload (especially at high dosages) than other [serotonergic psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) . This may make it dangerous to combine it with other [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and certain substances which releases neurotransmitters such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) or [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . These substances include but are not limited to:

## Legal status

- **Austria** : 2C-T-21 is illegal to possess, produce and sell under the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Canada** : As of October 31st, 2016; 2C-T-21 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.
- **Germany** : 2C-T-21 is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 2C-T-21 are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : 2C-T-21 can be considered a controlled substance as a defined derivative of Phenethylamine under Verzeichnis E point 130. It is legal when used for scientific or industrial use.
- **United Kingdom** : 2C-T-21 is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the phenethylamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 2C-T-21 is technically not scheduled in the United States, but could be considered an analogue of 2C-T or 2C-T-7 and may therefore be considered a Schedule I drug under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-T-21*

2C-T-21, also known as 4-(2-fluoroethylthio)-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C family. It is taken orally.
2C-T-21 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1991. Shortly after this, Shulgin described 2C-T-17 in greater detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved).

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists the dose range as 8 to 12 mg orally and its duration as 7 to 10 hours. Its onset is described as 15 minutes to 1 hour and peak effects occur after 1 to 2 hours. The effects of 2C-T-21 have been described.

## Toxicity

On March 9, 2004, a 22-year-old quadriplegic man named James Edwards Downs in St. Francisville, Louisiana, consumed an unknown dose of 2C-T-21 by sticking his tongue into a vial of powder he had purchased online. He developed a temperature of 108 °F (42 °C), had a tonic-clonic seizure, and slipped into a coma.  Four days later, on March 13, Downs died at Lane Memorial Hospital in Zachary, LA.
This death became part of a two-year DEA investigation called Operation Web Tryp which was launched in 2002. On July 22, 2004, the owners of American Chemical Supply were arrested on federal charges relating to distribution of controlled substance analogues and the death of James Edwards Downs. Little is known about the toxicity of 2C-T-21 beyond this incident.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-T-21 shows high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 27 nM). It produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-T-21 has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-T-21 include 2C-T-2, 2C-T-21.5, and 2C-T-22, among others.

## History

2C-T-21 was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in a journal article in 1991. Shortly thereafter, it was described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The potential applications of 2C-T-21 in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy were explored by Myron Stolaroff.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

2C-T-21 is unscheduled and uncontrolled in the United States, but possession and sales of 2C-T-21 would probably be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act because of its structural similarities to 2C-T-7 and its known potential to cause death. In the wake of Operation Web Tryp in July 2004, at least one distributor faced charges as a consequence of the death of James Downs from 2C-T-21 overdose.

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-T-21 is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.
