# Etizolam

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Etizolam*

**Etizolam** is a research chemical analogue of the [benzodiazepine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Benzodiazepines) class of drugs - the benzene ring being replaced by a thiophene ring, making it a thienodiazepine. The drug largely shares the effect profile of benzodiazepine drugs (being both hypnotic and anxiolytic), however studies have shown some major differences between etizolam and the more traditional benzos used for treatments; it suffers much less from a rapid build-up of tolerance, and also has a larger range of observed side-effects with abuse.

## History

The availability of Etizolam in the more general research chemical scene began around 2011, and attention has only increased since. Its prevalence is probably due to both the low cost of the drug (with 500-1000 standard doses costing around £100, and is available in bulk powder form for even less), and the highly addictive nature it shares with benzodiazepines.

Though relatively new to the recreational research chemical scene, etizolam differs from most other research chemicals in that it is actually approved and actively prescribed as a medical treatment for anxiety in many countries around the world (such as India) under brand names such as Etilaam and Etizest. Its origins as a medical drug are actually very unclear, though medical papers citing its use in the treatment of anxiety are recorded as early as the 90s.

### Long Term Effects

- The effects of long-term Etizolam, as with benzodiazepine use include drug dependence as well as the possibility of adverse effects on cognitive function, physical health, and mental health.

- There are a number of side-effects associated with addiction to benzodiazepines such as depression and flu-like symptoms, though occurring in only a small amount of people.

- In some users, particular with abuse Etizolam has been shown to cause blepharospasm.

- In very rare cases, Etizolam has been responsible for skin lesions in abusers.

## Harm Reduction

- When on high doses of depressants, users are likely to black out and potentially hurt themselves through misadventure. If you are taking a hypnotic dose of Etizolam, it is best to confine yourself to your bed.

- Some users report Etizolam as given to compulsive redosing, especially when a user is 'blacked out'. To avoid this, keep doses low and be wary of reduced inhibitions while under the influence.

### Interactions

As with other depressants, Etizolam should not be combined with any other CNS depressants (such as [alcohol](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Alcohol)), at the risk of respiratory depression, which can lead to death.

See the [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) chart for more information.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Etizolam is absorbed fairly rapidly, with peak plasma levels achieved between 30 minutes and 2 hours. It has a mean elimination half life of about 3.5 hours. Etizolam acts as a full agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor to produce its range of therapeutic and adverse effects. In addition, etizolam, unlike most other benzodiazepines, has prolactogenic effects, leading to an increase in blood levels of prolactin, which is a protein that in humans is best known for its role in enabling female mammals to produce milk.

During a controlled clinical trial that compared the effectiveness of etizolam and several benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, it was found that etizolam became more effective over time, implying a type of reverse tolerance.

The LD50 of Etizolam is currently unknown.
