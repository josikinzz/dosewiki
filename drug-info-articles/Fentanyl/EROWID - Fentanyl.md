Fentanyl is schedule I in Canada. (Note: Canadian schedules are very different than U.S. schedules). In at least some parts of Ontario, those prescribed fentanyl patches must return their used patches in order to receive prescription refills. See [http://www.pcchu.ca/2014/02/18/local-healthcare-providers-collaborate-to-address-misuse-of-fentanyl-in-peterborough/](http://www.pcchu.ca/2014/02/18/local-healthcare-providers-collaborate-to-address-misuse-of-fentanyl-in-peterborough/) and [http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4905577-fentanyl-patch-program-aims-to-reduce-accidental-overdoses/](http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/4905577-fentanyl-patch-program-aims-to-reduce-accidental-overdoses/) . One visitor tells us that this policy will be implemented for all of Ontario as of Jan 1, 2015, but we've been unable to find confirmation of that. (thanks G) (last updated Oct 13 2014)
