Propylphenidate (also known as PPH) is a piperidine based stimulant drug, closely related to methylphenidate, but with the methyl ester replaced by a propyl ester. It was banned in the UK as a Temporary Class Drug from April 2015 following its unapproved sale as a designer drug.

## Legal status

Propylphenidate is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016, and in Finland since 2017.
