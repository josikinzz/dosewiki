## Subjective Experience

Hops are of course best known for use in the production of beer, but do in fact have
other purposes. Indeed, they are used for a variety of other beverages and in
traditional herbal medicines.

I have read a number of accounts which state that hops are psychoactive when
smoked or even when consumed alone with hot water, but equally, I have seen this
disputed just as frequently. Regarding the former, the claims usually assert that hops
are mildly sedating, and are sometimes evidenced by the fact that the plant is related
to cannabis.

Even though Erowid states that hops “Promotes Appetite and Sleep; Reduces
Anxiety” my expectations are not very high. Note that I was also initially concerned
when I noticed a label on the pack stating 'alpha-acid 6.17%', until I discovered that
this is a constituent part of the plant itself.

Electing to smoke, at least in the first instance, I pack my large bong at 4:45pm, light
and inhale deeply. I actually take three tokes, the second of which is harsh, whilst
the other two are smooth. Perhaps I inhaled at different temperatures.

Taking my seat I feel somewhat relaxed, with perhaps the mildest of heady sedations.
At this level, we are in placebo terrain, or possibly where, as a non-smoker, the
inhalation of smoke itself has caused a bit of a mental reset.

Ten minutes in I still feel a little flushed and calm, and my windpipe is recovering
nicely from its slight trauma. This calmness and face flush fade gradually but are still
present an hour later.

Could this simply be the impact of smoke aligned with placebo? It doesn’t feel this
way, but I am not stoned either. If I was forced to make a call, I would probably say
that there is a slight degree of psychoactivity here.

ORAL ADMINISTRATION
The next day I decide to initiate another experiment; this time by soaking half a mug
of hops in hot water, straining into another mug, and drinking as tea. Note here that
this is not alcoholic and there is no fermentation.

The taste is very bitter: revolting actually. I manage to get it down and I begin to feel
a little distant and for want of better words, light headed. There is no head flush as
per smoking, but I may be slightly more relaxed than earlier. In fact none of this is as
intense as the effect of the smoking route, and is subtle enough that I would probably
have missed it had I been active.

A couple of hours later it has faded although I remain relatively calm. I also feel a
little more sleepy than usual for the rest of the day.

Overall, there is probably something to this, although not a lot. In stating this I
should also add that I read the following on Wikipedia, which may or may not be a
factor here: "Hops tend to be unstable when exposed to light or air and lose their
potency after a few months' storage".

```
Hops are a constituent and fundamental part of the beer making process,
and are used primarily for bittering, flavouring, and stability.
