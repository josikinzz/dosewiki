U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**DOI**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Likely Analog
 
DOI is unscheduled in the United States. It is likely that it would be considered an analog (of DOB), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any such existing cases (6/21/04). DOI is regularly used in animal and in vitro research, Scheduling DOI would impose substantial costs to brain research.
