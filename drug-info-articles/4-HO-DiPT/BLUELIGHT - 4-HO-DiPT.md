**Welcome to the Big & Dandy 4-HO-DiPT Thread**


![200px-4-HO-DIPT.SVG.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F2%2F27%2F4-HO-DIPT.SVG%2F200px-4-HO-DIPT.SVG.png&hash=bcd4c509fe5719493be63c04c27c84e7)

​

At this moment you can consider this an archive on both 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT, however discussion is now split up

even if 4-HO vs. 4-AcO discussion is inevitable and allowed in both threads where relevant.

Firstly, has anyone here got any experience with this family of chemicals ?

You know, the two are NOT necessarily one and the same, what I'd be interested to know is if there's anyone who may have tried both and can contrast and compare. It's really pure theory that the acetoxy might be converted to hydroxy before having a chance to hit the brain. Hell, wasn't it only recently that they were even able to prove psilocybin converts to psilocin?

what is this about shuddering? i've heard of the infamous 'jelly legs'..does that apply to the 4-HO-DiPT or 4-AcO-DiPT or both?

I personally don't think they are alike from the sounds of the reports, but I as of yet have not sampled either material.  If anything, the acetoxy seems to last longer and this may reflect the possibility that it is converted in the body to 4-Ho-DiPT to become active.  Thus, this conversion would both slow down the onset and lengthen the comedown which, from the reports, seems to be happening.  4-Ho-DiPT trips (according to TIHKAL) do not last longer than 2.5 to 3 hours.  That factor alone can end up changing the very nature of the trip all together.

A friend of mine has extensive experience with 4-aco-dipt. For what it's worth, he says the experience is remarkably similar to the report given by Shulgin for 4-ho-dipt, except that the aco version lasts a lot longer. Excellent, excellent substance.

Read the TIHKAL entry on 4-Ho-DiPT, it is talked about.  I've also heard it mentioned in 4-AcO-DiPT reports.


Interestingly enough, I have experienced what I believe to be the same shuddering on 4-AcO-DET.  One time the trembeling was so severe I became quite alarmed.  I don't recall experiencing it the last few times though.

In TIHKAL, Shulgin lists a dosage of 4-Ho-DiPT to be 15 to 20 mg.  That dosage though sounds a bit on the low-side for a 4-AcO-DiPT trip.  Most people seem to report the best effects for 4-AcO-DiPT are in the 30 to 40 mg range.  Do you guys think this is just a case of Shulgin recommending dosages on the low side, or is maybe 4-Ho-DiPT is a bit more potent than its acetoxy ester.


Anyone have any personal experience with 4-Ho-DiPT?  I am going to experiment with this compound in the coming weeks and I don't want to take too much.

i haven't tried 4-ho-dipt, but i did have a couple tries with the 4-aco.


first, this was with several different people.  average onset time was around 20min +/- 5.  it lasted over 4 hours peak, 6 hours total.  highest dosage was 35mg with no booster, lowest was 10mg.  


i was the 35mg, and that was far too much for me.  maybe i'm just sensitive.  i usually have a high threashold for tryptamines, but this could be.  however, no one we tripped with was willing to go over 25mg a second time, everyone agreed it was too much.

See, your trip lasted so much longer than 4-Ho-DiPT trips are supposed to last.  Shulgin made such a big deal about how short the 4-Ho-DiPT was.  He said little action at 2.5 hr and nothing at 3 hr.  I think 4-AcO-DiPT and 4-Ho-DiPT are fairly different drugs as far as effects go.  I'll prolly start with 15 mg of 4-Ho-DiPT to be safe.  I can always try more some other time.  I wish I had some of the Aco to compare with.

^^^

that may well be, i don't deny that.  however, i have found that shulgin's times are off frequently, sometimes by a little, sometimes more.  i use his times as very loose guidelines, and usually plan for an extra hour or two on new ones.


please do let us know after your experiment, i'd love to have some 4-ho data to compare against my 4-aco.


peace

**4-Ho-DiPT**


and such a tight steep response curve!  even if Shulgin is off on the dose, and is going low, you have to admit the tight steep response curve is interesting, perhaps it is just a really potent tryptamine. based on the THIKAL entry, personal experience, educated guessing and a random tossing of chicken bones I would consider trying 16mg for a first go with 4-Ho-DiPT.  The 15mg seemed barely threshold, and its so short acting, what's another mg.

My psychadelic past: Ive used shrooms, mescaline, lsd, mdma, mda all in the past.


Of the research chems Ive only tried 4-ho-dipt.


I find the reports on erowid and shulgins report are very close to what I have experienced.


Ive tried 20mg, 20mg boosted with 10mg an hour later, and 25mg at the start. These were all seperate times.


More or less effects start at 15 minutes and by 40 minutes it is peaking or close to it.  At 2.5-3 hours things are almost baseline.  At 5 hours sleeping is not a problem.  It comes in waves so the peak is hard to know for sure.


One thing Ive run into with 4-ho-dipt is that it oxidized very quickly.  I put measured 500mg into 100mL of distilled water. Originally this was kept in a dark cupboard.  After a day the water was not clear looking and was now dark, almost like grape juice.


Myself and another have both experienced 4-ho-dipt since then and the fact that the solution darkened doesnt appear to make any difference.  It may have even sped up the onset.  I will know for sure after more research.


Highly recomended

fascinating. such rapid onset is very interesting to me.  did the 20mg+10mg booster experience differ much in total length and depth of effects from the 25mg at the start?  typical tryptamine gastro effects?

As far as sides go.. a little bit of a bloated feeling.. a few chills here and there but nothing like I had when on acid.  a lot of energy in the legs and feet (also had this with acid).  


the time I tried 20mg alone was my least favorite but it was still good.  I wanted to see how the come up and come down was without the booster.  This was also on an empty stomach.  


I liked the 22.5mg dose better, the little bit extra goes a long way.  The experience is good enough that I don't see much point in pushing the envelope with more.  Im guessing that the bad trip report on erowid (trembling) that they had too much or a different substance..  In that report, they "eyeballed" 20mg..  I wouldn't even try that. and measured out 500mg on a friends scale before mixing with 100mL distilled water.


with 20mg and 10mg booster I had eaten about  an hour before ingestion.  It was great. a nice body buzz, warm feeling, happy.  After experiencing the chem a couple other times with only one dose (no booster) the duration is roughly the same.  Once the effects are gone Im left feeling a little wired.. but nothing to complain about.


the first time, (20mg + 10mg booster at 1hr) I took at 10:00pm, and was asleep in bed by 3:30am.  


the time I took 22.5mg, ingested at 8:02 and was asleep before 1am.  This is good since I am normally quite the insomniac and have hard time falling asleep.


Also, I found the experience is very similar to the reports of BOTH 4-acetoxy-dipt and 4-ho-dipt.


To me it looks like 4-ace-dipt has a higher dosage, later onset, and longer duration, but the essense of the trip is the same. (only based on info I've read on here and the resources on erowid)

^^^^^^^^


In your opinion, is this chemical a 'good one', or more of a novelty?  By good one, I don't just mean that if feels good or is fun, but is actually a valid and reliable psychedelic (mind expanding) drug?  Is there substance to it?

I think that this drug has a function in mind expansion.   It seems that the mind stays pretty clear through the experience but it is easy to close your eyes, sit back, let go, and just take it all in.  I like that I didnt have any negative thoughts while on except for a fleeting thought here and there on what it would be like if it got too intense or if I werent able to handle it. 


At some points action seem almost predefined. Like my mind is following what my body is set to do and I am thinking and analyzing everything in the meantime.  Others have mentioned things similar to this in the trip reports.  


There are times where I realize that I stopped in the middle of something and have to re-figure out what Im doing.  


One example was that I decided to come to bluelight to check out the forum while trippin and never made it past my home page.  I had the address field typed in and highlighted and needed to press enter..but I was just gettin off on the visuals I was getting off of the text on the screen.  


Also I notice that Im in a generally good mood for days following this.  before the first instance I was "in a funk" and had a "blah" attitude for a few weeks.. Afterwards I've chilled out some and feel that my head is actually more clear than before..


This isnt a drug that is going to let you meet god, at least not in my experience.   I think to reach that point you've got to be so far off that all emotions are running wild and you're on the edge of control.  I felt that I had control throughout the experience.


It definately has a nice body buzz and worthwhile visuals.  It also feels like it has a strong sensual side to it as well.  I haven't had the opportunity to have intercourse on it yet but I anticipate it would be amazing.  There were times where just breathing deep with eyes closed and listening to music was almost orgasmic.

Since my last post I tried 4-ho-dipt with my girlfriend.


She has used MDMA several times but nothing in the lsd, shroom field, let alone rc's.  


When taking it, we both went with 20mg.  


I had the same results as each other time, as mentioned above.  I still feel this is a mild drug. At least when I take it (5 times so far).  


My girlfriend had a different experience.  The trip started in about 15 minutes with a strong body load.  She was feeling tired and felt that if the tired feeling went away she'd be alright.  It seemed the little effects that I would feel were exaggerated on her.  While I'd feel a little anxious, a little tired, etc, she would go through periods where these symptoms bothered her.


About 1.5 hours later the body load/ tired feeling cleared and the trip really started.  


She experienced more of a mind fuck than I had and her emotions were running wild.  From anxious to angry to sensual to fear all in rapid rates. She was getting visual hallucinations that were overwhelming, at times she wasn't sure what was real and what wasn't.  She also was getting audio hallucinations and hearing people talk to her.


After smoking a bowl of bud she went into a relaxed floating orgasm laying on a couch that went for about 5 minutes.  This part she loved but the rest was a nightmare for her.


Her opinion was that the drug opened up parts of her that should be secret.  She didn't like the journey it brought her on.  


While this was happening I was feeling alright, not necessarily feeling great because I was dealing with a lot of mental stress with her having a bad trip.


She was worried she'd be stuck in this state (reminds me of times when friends had a bad acid trip).. I stated a time before we took it that we'd be asleep by 3am (took it at 10pm).  Time was moving very slowly.  At 2:30 she was still talking crazy but more calmed down and waiting for sleep.  At 2:35 it pretty much shut off and she fell asleep.


One thing I am thankful for is the fast nature of this drug.   


I wouldn't recommend to my anybody who isnt versend in psychadelia because everybody is going to react differently.  


I still like it but will second guess any more use of 4-ho-dipt because I don't "trust" it as much as before.

I have found the 4-Acetoxy-DiPT has a VERY steep dosage response curve.


Here are some notes that I ran across....


_________________


20mg resulted in a very mild, friendly, short-lived trip on the order of about 4 hours.  Very warm and cozy.  Not threatening in any way.  Nice synesthesia with music. Unusual note...  the trip seemed to have 2 peaks. Interesting.


22.5mg - Powerful trip and much longer in duration (6h or so) than the 20mg dose.   Perfect in every way, but at times it was almost overwhelming.  I was there!  Full understanding.  One-ness.  (++++)  Again, this trip also had 2 definite peaks.  I could feel the end of the plateau....  twice.   Quite strange.


That 22.5mg trip resulted in some 17 pages of handwritten notes that I am in the process of converting into a report and will one day, if Im lucky, post it on Erowid.   


It has been 3 years since that 22.5mg trip, and I have not felt the urge to taste that one since.


________________


I have personally spoken to several people that have taken 4-Acetoxy-DiPT from the same batch on multiple occasions.  They tend to bear out our general supposion that the higher the dose you take of this stuff, the longer the trip tends to be.  I chatted with a chap about 2 years back that had take 48mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT (I cannot recommend this).  I can't locate my notes about the conversation, but to the best of my recollection, he had a trip that lasted about 9 hours!!!  He told me it was as strong, if not stronger, than any high-dose acid experience he had ever had.


For the most part, I'm a PEA man.   I never really feel like I can catch my groove on tryptamines. But all in all, I would have to say that this is a "good one".  Its not fluff.  Its a pure, honest, life-changing psychedlic and it should be respected (and enjoyed) with that in mind.


Happy Trails,


DrWild

Has anyone noticed a tolerance with either of these chemicals, or cross tolerance with other chemicals?  


I seem to recall a thread sometime somewhere where someone mentioned no perceived tolerance build up after using 4-AcO-DiPT several days in a row.  Can't find the thread now.

Still no responses from someone who has taken both substances on multiple occasions and could accurately compare and contrast the two? Shulgins information has not satisfied me and what is to be considered either substance is thrown around quite loosely in the trip reports Ive read. To me, it sounds like the relationship between 4ACO and 4HO is like DXM vs DXO. Id imagine it being something like a hollow shroom experience almost. And did I read someone saying that the stuff can last up to 9 hours? Thats pretty facsinating considering ive only had seriously high doses of shrooms last only about 6 - 8 hours. I think ill scratch 4-HO off my 'to do' list until these guys get some regular 4ACO in stock or until theres more concrete information available.

^^^^^^^^^^


Really, the 4-Ho is the 'regular' and the 4-AcO version is the 'something else.'  It was the 4-Ho that was described by Shulgin in TIHKAL and it 3 hr duration seems well established.


It is the 4-AcO that seems to have more of the weird side-effects (shakes and what-not) and the inconsistant trip length (from 3 hr up to 9 hr.)  I'd be weary of the 4-AcO version and hunt after the 4-Ho.  The only advantage of having the 4-AcO is it is more stable.  Or is supposed to be anyway.

**Iprocin**


ok, I tried 20mg of 4-Ho-DiPT (Iprocin). 


The entire experience lasted 3 hours, was interesting, but hardly earth shattering. I took notes, but not much to report really. My ego remained fully intact; I experienced mild color shifting and somewhat minimal mental effects.  Physically it was very friendly, with no negative body load to speak of, but little euphoria or yummy body feelings. I would take 22 or 24mg if I was to try this batch again.  Its quick onset and short duration might make it valuable in certain circumstances. 


I am wondering if 4-AcO-DiPT isn’t psychoactive in its own right, and then after it metabolizes the 4-Ho psychoactive properties become apparent.  This might explain DrWild’s report of a double peak on the 4-AcO, but his reported dosages are uncharacteristically small, closer to the 4-Ho doses. You sure which on you took Doc?  


Is it a valuable material?  Is it more of a tool or a toy?  Well, I’m not sure I can answer that given my limited experience.  Additionally, my one and only 4-AcO-DiPT experience was a complete bust; it failed bioassay and I wrote it off as a bad synthesis, so I have no basis for comparison there either.

**Iprocin gets two thumbs up**


I just took 24 mg of Iprocin (4-Ho-DiPT) for the first time with a close friend and we were both very impressed.  Fantastic material all around!  l had some true spiritual moments where my ego/self was completely striped away and I was just once with the earth.  Very cosmic stuff in that classic tryptamine way.  We took this material outdoors at night and a POWERFUL +3 was experienced by both uf us, and I was flirting with a +4 at times.  The good thing though was we never felt overwhelmed at any time.  Easy on the body and the mind.  I'd say 24 mg is the maxium level.  I'll prolly dose a little less next time as this material is definitely up for repeats one day.

well shit, I guess I should have gone for a couple more mgs. by the way, Shulgin does indeed confirm suspicions that 4-AcO is psychoactive in its own right, and then metabolizes into the 4-Ho.  This might explain DrWild's double peak experience with the acetoxy.

anyone try insufflated iprocin?  negative effects seem to be less prominent (i feel slight nausea during come on and slight dysphoria w/ clammy hands, i think almost worse than alphaO).  the visuals were more intense compared to how my mind and body felt.  very nice indeed probably a +2.  peaked by 30-40min after insufflation, about 2 hrs in duration, and came in the familiar, pleasant waves.  used 10-13mg at MOST...

anyone experiment with this?

20 mg is not a mild dose of Iprocin (if you are talking about oral administration.)  Everyone has their own degree of tolerance.  Dosages of most substances vary.

Ok my friends and I recently tried 4-HO-DiPT. Everyone said 20mg was a good dose, but we believe that this is an under estimate. I used a digital scale to measure out 20mg doses and we ate them. An hour later we each snorted 10mg cuz we weren't feeling it enough. Then we smoked 40mg about 30 mins after snorting it. Then it got good and strong, after about 40mg per person. Jus thought I'd let ya know that 20mg may not be enough.

Perhaps the 4-ho-dipt you guys had was slightly degraded. I always found 20mg to be a sufficient dose for 4-aco-dipt (with maybe another 20mg at T+1:30 to prolong it not to intensify it). However, recently someone sent me a 20mg sample of 4-ho-dipt and all I got was threshold effects. Considering 4-ho-dipt has a lower molecular weight than 4-aco-dipt it should actually be slightly more potent by weight. So I'm led to believe the 4-ho-dipt that was sent to me was degraded. Either way, I would strongly suggest anyone trying either of these not to try more than 20mg the first time.

hmmm maybe, 4-ho-dipt is highly unstable from what i hear.  and youre right it should be slightly more potent than 4-aco-dipt in theory.   great chemical in my opinion.

Who knows?  Do you know anyone who has done this?  Neither do I.  You will be going into uncharted waters.  No can say it's "safe" but based on the fact that mixing Rue with most other N-substituted tryptamines works fine, I don't see why this wouldn't.  5-MeO-DMT seems to be an exception.

i liked iprocin.  the body high was good.  mindset was never uncontrolable unlike with lsd or mushies.  visuals were present, but not too prominent, i did get enhanced colors and minor breathing of walls. i think the most signifigant part of the whole experience was the body high.  i didnt get any body tremors or negative body load i just had a good body high.  i really cant decribe the body high cause ive never felt one like i have off of iprocin.  this chemical is definately one worth trying.

Just a F.Y.I.


There is a **VERY** special synergy between Iprocin and ketamine.  I have found mixing ketamine with other psychedelics can be touch and go.  I wish I had some details of the Iprocin/ketamine combo but such things are beyond words.  But again, the two were fantastic together and I will be repeating it sometime again.


The dosages used were 20 mg (orally) of Iprocin and 120 mg (IM) of ketamine which I took about 1 hr 20 min after I consumed the Iprocin.


[random point]Iprocin kinda reminds me of what 5-MeO-DMT would be like if you took it orally.  It has the same spiritual opening and warmth for me as 5-MeO-DMT, but it's gentle and not as emmersive.  I almost wonder if Iprocin would (to me) resemble 5-MeO-DMT if it were smoked.  I don't intend to find out as it works fine orally and I'll take 5-MeO-DMT if I want that kind of trip.  But maybe some other explorer one day will try smoking Iprocin and report on what happens.[/random point]

I just sort of recently got a little bit of Iprocin.


First time I tried it, I must have taken too low of a dose or just didnt "understand" the effects the lower doses have even when I dont see visuals other than color enhancement/other "unique" things.  I think I redosed a couple hours later and realised when i concentrated on the body buzz, it really was a good one, not an annoying one like 5-meo-dipt or 2c-t-2.  I could close my eyes, listening to music, and closed eye I could kind of direct my vision, i might have saw "normal psychedelic" type visuals swirling around, but they were sort of "not in your face", 3 dimentional faint but amazing visuals.  Well i paid attention to them for long enough and it turned into images and kind of cartoonish-animation that started to more and more correspond to whatever music was playing.  Music really got to my emotions, when i closed my eyes and relaxed.


At higher dosages, seems to be a point where its like "whoa, cool!" look at these beautiful OEV's, and wow, its like, well, its Iprocin visuals, something I might see on a high dosage LSD trip.  But its like you have this warm, comforting blanket around you, thats attached to reality.  I have closed my eyes long enough when the other person i was with was doing the same and almost sort of forgot what part of the room i was in.  As soon as I open my eyes, everything is back to mostly normal.  


On my last trip, i was able to concentrate on the TV screen, on a certain video DVD with the menu on, doing nothing.  I could stare deep into the actual way my brain is processing this information (of lines, curves, etc) into letters and eventually the english language where i knew what the word was.  It was like I could shut more and more of this off, down to the invidual letters starting to come apart, looking like little "workers" in my body (me, the big dude, president of mr. ...well me and all smaller parts).  Moving around, like they are relaxin', chillin', like maybe this is meant to do.  It was like, letting the perception filtering take a break, relax for once, like your a owner of a huge company, like almost a dictator but, not totally!  - letting your perception "workers" take a break, and thats when you can see things in a TOTALLY alien perspective, like the brain not knowing the old way and completely randomly collecting together to form another one way.


One thing i noticed, DIPT lasts over 24 hours to me, back to my sound being completely normal.  5-meo-dipt has a pitch shift effect, and not as bad harmonic distortion "different" than dipt but somewhat similar.  I notice 4-ho-dipt's effect on lower of pitch, usually the higher doses do it more.  Its not the same as 5-meo-dipt or dipt, "unique" but still similar to dipt, its that dipt thing, somehow that targets the sound region partially, maybe the other stuff attached makes it more 'selective' haha.  Anyway, the nights I kept underdosing I would boost with a dose, I noticed the sound effect was still there but almost gone, into the next day.  Not bothersome but noticeable..


Incredible visuals off this stuff at higher doses, I noticed it seems to take 50 minutes-1:20 or so for the effects to really kick in, unlike the 20 minutes pihkal says (at least for me).


Oh, i forgot, I smoked a little toke of salvia extract on that last trip i had, just a little bit..not to get immediately blown to a vivid ego loss state (its incredible while tripping on another psy.), but enough where i could control it.  Salvia mixes great, although it usually does for me on any psychedelic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I too have noted the same thing....it takes about an hour for Iprocin to really get going, there are many visuals, and it lasts longer than the 3 hr reported in TIHKAL.  Yet, another example of where Shulgin's words and experiences should be taken as a guide, not as fact.  There are many other examples of where drugs he described turn out to be different when they are taken outside of his inner-circle.

I noticed this to a degree with the iprocin-counterpart as well.  While doses above 30mg were still quite joyful and filled with fantasy-like visuals which were absent at lower doses; the experience was too ecstatic as you put it so perfectly.  But allow me to add a bit...


It was as if everything is experienced too honestly, too purely, and too perfectly that i just can't help but have sensory input overload--its impossible to process it all and come back to baseline with something gained.  Don't get me wrong, the experience was still extremely joyful (the best way i can describe it--"recreational" just doesn't cut it).  But to come back with an understanding of the substance, or an understanding of the insights it can provide, you really need something below 30 mg.


But its such a tease in this way b/c the visual phenomena is just so beautiful and unique to other tryptamines in higher-end doses, that i can't help but indulge.


And a side note, this psychedelic seems to be nose-friendly (unlike most PEA's), but less visually intense.  After experimenting with this route of administration a little bit more, it seems the duration of everything is roughly cut in half.  About 30-45 minutes coming up to peak, 0.5-1.5 hour plateau, etc.  The oral ROA happens to be my personal preference though.

Another interesting point i'd like to make about Iprocin that i think has been mentioned in some way or another before... 


Most tryptamines seem to take you to another place, or dimension for lack of a better word.  The most effecient of these is DMT and even mushrooms in doses above six grams or so.  These psychedelics seem to be more of the party drug type since they are more visually pronounced and definable, but thats about all the significance they possess.  They are entheogenically lacking (with the exception to mushrooms)--more bizarre than spiritually insightful.


But Iprocin takes you to that magical place that seems to allow you to experience *all* dimensions at once, rather than just an extremely bizarre one.  It doesn't take you to a specfic psychedelic landscape, but rather allows you to tap into all of them in one mass-spectrum of understanding.  


This sort of merging, collective consciousness produces less definable or "woaah dude cool" visuals.  Its beyond that simple "trippy" experience that most other tryptamines provide (5-meo-dipt, amt, dipt, etc)--making iprocin less appealing to some.


So in this way, Iprocin is like 5-meo-dmt.  Except Iprocin seems to be talored to the less than hardcore tripper with a gentler onset and more affinity for understanding and comprehending.


I think this also explains why a lot of people either hate or love Iprocin, just like 5-meo-dmt.  If you go into the experience looking for a headfuck and some good old fashion elve's licking your genitalia, then you will emerge in distaste of the drug at best.  You'll be shown reality in such a true and unadultered form that you'll be left psychologically agitated at worst.  After all you were just looking to see pretty colors right?


But if you welcome the intensity by fully submitting your psyche to the drug's mind expansive effects, you will be rewarded with a rare glimpse into how reality *actually* works.

It seems to me to be rather unreasonable to compare any of the 4-position research tryptamines to shrooms. Worse than comparing apples to oranges, it's more like comparing variants on citric acid to oranges. When we talk about shrooms we aren't just talking about psilocybin and psilocin, we are talking about chemical cocktail that also includes baeocystin, norbaeocystin, both of which are considered to be active, and dozens of other indoles which may or may not affect the flavor of the shroom experience. As a result of different proportions of these additional indoles, we get variances in the flavor of the trip in one strain or species of shrooms to the next. We see the same with other plant psychedelics as well, for example due to additional alkaloids peyote is reported to have a different experience from synthetic mescaline, and also a different experience from san pedro. What would be interesting for me would be to compare the varieties of mushshroom strains and species to synthetic 4-ho-dmt. In my eperience all of the plant psychedelics I have tasted have been considerably more complex and variable in their character than any of the chemical psychedelics I have tasted. 4-aco-det, 4-aco-mipt and 4-aco-dipt are all definitely less complex than shrooms in my experience. That's not to say the chemical psychedelics don't have their place. Their predictability can make them much better for theraputic settings. OTOH in some situations one might want the variability and complexity of plant psychedelics as well.


That having been said, I didn't find 4-aco-dipt to be anything at all like 5-meo-dmt. While most of the synthetic tryptamines do seem to take me to the same 'place', they take me there in quite different ways. 5-meo-dmt seems to take me straight there, without any chance to look back, and without any mercy at all if I resist. 4-aco-dipt is much more gentle. It just kinda nudges me there but doesn't force me. It also provides me some scenery along they way in the form of strong visuals. My usual dose of 4-aco-dipt is 20mg followed by another 20mg at T+1:00. That provides me with a partly longer and partly more intense trip. I found a single dose of 4-aco-dipt, as high as 28 mg, would dissappoint me when the intense part wore off, i.e. it was too short lasting. I've only tasted 4-ho-dipt once, and that was a sample sent to me and was a low dose. At that dose I didn't notice any difference with 4-aco-dipt. YMMV.

Happy new year, AlphaOdure. I don't mean any hostility, I'm sorry if I came off that way. I understand you want me to talk about the topic of this thread, which is iprocin/iprocetin (not just iprocin) but I can't talk about them in a void. I have to give some context in which I understand my experiences, so I first need to tell you what I mean by 'complexity' and how I experience it. Then I can tell you how I've experienced iprocin and iprocetin (mostly iprocetin) in terms of complexity.


By 'complexity' I mean variability and to some extent unpredictability in the style and flavor of the substance. With all of chemical psychedelics that I have the privilege to taste (including LSD, DPT, 4-aco/ho-dipt, 4-aco-det and 4-aco-mipt, 2c-e, 2c-i and maybe half a dozen other research chems) there seems to me to be a pattern of relative consistency predictability that comes with them compared to say shrooms, cacti, or ayahuasca. I've noticed subtle variability in the feel and style different strains of mushrooms I have tasted, and the same for cacti. Many others report differences in the high produced by different st ains of mushrooms, and it seems to be a consensus amongst avid shroomers. What I'm talking about has little to do with how 'entheogenic' a substance is or even how much 'mindfuck' a substance has. In fact I can't think of a better example of what I mean by a complex substance than cannabis. With so many strains producing so many different quality highs, I can't see how cannabis can be reduced to just THC. Something else is affecting the different highs, be it some other cannabanoids or something else. At least it strongly seems that way to me. And it seems that way to me and others with different strains of shrooms as well, though it is more subtle.


Now I guess in theory there could be variability between different batches of iprocetin. Such differences could be the result of either sloppy synthesis or decomposition. Of course, we expect better than that from a chemist. And having tasted iprocetin numerous times from two different batches, one from August 2001 and another from July 2003, I can't notice even the subtlest variability in how it affects me. And the one time I tasted iprocin I didn't notice any difference between that and the iprocetin, though I do wish I could have tasted it in higher dose to get a better comparison. While set and setting do affect my experiences, I still don't see anything at all with iprocetin like the variability in flavor I get with shrooms. Of course, that's not to say I don't think iprocetin is a magical substance. It definitely is, or I wouldn't have tasted it so many times. And I find other perhaps more pronounced differences between iprocetin and shrooms. Iprocetin for me tends to be rather clear headed, more focused, and with only little effect on the ego compared to shrooms. I find it to be a very good tool for enhancing meditation.


With regards to the legal situation and how it limits scientific research, I think first we need to consider that with respect to iprocin and iprocetin we don't even have toxicology studies. We have no idea what the LD50 is, nor do we know if they are neurotoxic, hepatoxic, renotoxic, or whatever. Of course, we don't know everything about every alkaloid in every species/strain of psilocybin containing mushrooms either. Still I think shrooms are less risky as they have a long history of use relatively free of toxic reactions. As far as differences in effects between iprocin and shrooms, or variabilities of mushroom effects, science can't say a lot about subjective effects, i.e. in-vitro tests on rat brain 5ht2a receptors don't say much about subjective experience in humans. What might conceivably be done though is some sort blind discrimination study to see if one could learn to discriminate between 4-ho-dmt and extracted mixtures of mushroom alkaloids both administered in gel caps so the user is 'blind'. Interestingly though, Shulgin states in Tihkal that he doesn't think people in a blind discrimination test would be able to discriminate between iprocin and psilocin, and psilocin he finds indistinguishable from mushrooms. Now I can't speak for synthetic psilocin, but I find iprocin and iprocetin to be nothing like shrooms at all and many others report the same. Of course it could also depend on the individual whether two different alkaloids, or mixtures of alkaloids, are dist nguishable. Without hard research we don't know much for sure with these substances. We each just have our own experiences to go by.


I hope that clarifies how I see things about iprocin in relation to shrooms. I do realize your experiences may differ. And I do realize this plant/fungi drug vs. synthetic drug complexity/variability thing could be a topic of its own. Perhaps if I get the motivation I'll start such a topic. Otherwise if someone wants to now, they can.

**4-ACO-DIPT, 1st real experience**


Tried 4-AcO-DIPT for the second time the other day. My first experiment was only a few days before at 14mg (maybe less) and achieved nothing -- I"m sometimes overly cautious with my inaugural doses. So my second try was at 25mg, closer to what sounds like a moderate dose for other people.


This trip followed a few hours after a light experiment with IAP (few effects) and cannabis. By the time I tried the 4-AcO I was 90% back to baseline, but the transition was basically straight from cannabis afterglow into tryptamine buzz. I took it after preparing dinner but waited 30 minutes before eating - I think my earlier 12mg dose was buried by food as well as being too low.


Shortly before eating some close friends popped by unexpectedly and ended up staying for dinner, so I got to try out the sociability of the substance. Overall very nice for conversation and comfort with others, not really empathetic but friendly and thoughtful in nature.


I found the body load slightly annoying, but never uncomfortable. The usual muscle tension and kundalini (deep shivers). I could see a little of what others reported about tactile enhancement -- of the five senses that one seemed to be affected most. No visuals at all, again just a mental comfortableness that, in a quieter more solitary setting, might have been great for meditation. In a social setting it was just kind of OK.


I dosed at 4:45, peaked around 6:15 (helped by a big glass of sangria, yum), and was mostly back to mental baseline by 9:30. Stimulation and sleeplessness continued until 11:30, eased a bit by melatonin. Actually I would say I probably slept only lightly all night, although felt adequately rested in the AM. Definitely a longish period of effect.


I will try this substance again at 30-40mg to see if the psychedelic effects are more pronounced, as reported elsewhere. I also look forward to experimenting with 4-Ho-DIPT, which sounds from some reports a bit more powerful and consistent.

Update: 


40mg of 4-AcO-DiPT


For me this is a good +++ recreational dose of this substance. 


Very warm and fuzzy, I think it had me sporting a perma-grin all afternoon. Fairly strong visuals, pleasant but not distracting. "Well integrated". The tiniest hint of the beginning of ego loss was tantalizing, but not threatening. I was made to feel ready to accept ego loss without actually going through it.


Very strong stimulation at this dose. At one point my lower legs were jumping around quite rapidly, although still under my conscious control. It just felt good (kind of necessary even) to move my legs really fast.


Haven't read many other reports about this, but I had more GI problems on this substance than others. Mmmmmm, runny bowels. 8)  


Comedown was a little depressing. Definitely felt the need for 'more' of something (though not necessarily of the 4-AcO). Not an energized comedown, more of a ho-hum feeling.


Aside from that, and the intestinal problems, this one's a keeper for sure.

I tried Iprocin for the first time today with my girlfriend.  We both took a modest dose of 15mgs, and it turned out to be an awesome day.  It took some Cannabis to get it kicked in good, but once it did, it had us going hard.  I haven't felt that Tryptamine feeling in quite a long time.  It was nice to experience that type of trip and visuals.  I am going to try it again at 20-25mgs within the next couple weeks.  I just thought I'd share my brief report.  I may write a trip report, or I may wait until I try it a couple more times.  ..Whatever seems fit.

I find iprocin every bit as rich and deep as mushrooms, though qualitatively different.  It's even unpredictable.  Sometimes it hit me fast, and other times it takes a while to get going.  Thankfully for me, iprocin proved to be "one of the worthy" synthetics.

I can echo mgs's previous statement with my limited (two) experiences with iprocin. It definitely has come to stay as a part of my psychedelic repertoire along with classics, like lsd, mushrooms, salvia and 5-meo-dmt. To me the 30mg trial was blissfully psychedelic, different than mushrooms but really powerful and deep.

Oh, I agree with just 15mgs.  It is definitely up there.  It was very deep, and it hit me hard because the last time I've used a Tryptamine, was around two years ago.  That's one of the reasons I chose a low dose.  I imagine 25-30mgs will take me far far away.  *smiles*  15mgs dose was perfect for me and my girlfriend.  It was really cold out, and neither of us were in the mood to get dressed appropriately for it, so we just tripped in her house.  It started around 4:30 ET, so it was still light out.  That bothered me a little.  This was definitely a night chemical for me.  Once it got dark, we lit some candles and put on some great trip music.  It was a really great experience.


..I also might mention that once the trip was over, we watched the new horror movie "Cabin Fever."  It was really freaking me out.  *laughs*  The movie seemed so much more real to me.

**Iprocin is Holy Powder**


I found 15mg of iprocin quite strong too.  I've had iprocin four times and all were above 20mg but this one 15mg trial.  I was blown far away with just 15mg, but I think part of the issue was my state of mind at the time.


Higher dosages of iprocin (20mg to 24mg) seem different than smaller ones.  Higher dosages seem to take longer to peak, and last longer.  This tryptamine tends to be (for the most part) pretty gentle though all in all compared to many of its brothers.


While my 15mg trip was rather smashing and pushy, again I think a lot of it was my mental state, or *set*, at that time.  Plus I was indoors during the day, I hate tripping in my apartment with my birds wanting to play, and just all the stuff everywhere makes it all too much.  Especially in full daylight.  Tripping during the day is just not relaxing to me unless I'm outdoors.


But yeah, all of my higher level iprocin trips were rather beautiful and warm to me.  All were outdoors at night.  I'll never forget the first one which was at night next to a mountain stream.  And I'll never forget how gentle the Universe opened up for me as I became a part of the great Beauty of Existence.  I received Grace.


Iprocin is one of the only synthetics I can think of that has a real "spiritual" element to it.  Of course all psychedelics can result in experiences that could be called "spiritual" to some people, but this one seems (for me) to especially focus in that area.  It reminds me a lot of 5-MeO-DMT, or at least they both reward me in similar ways.  I am curious what iprocin base is like smoked, if it resembles 5-MeO-DMT though I'm not going to try.  At least unless a few others do first.


[psychedelic commentary ramble]


The spiritual focus of iprocin is unlike, say 2C-T-7 and 2C-B, which seem to concentrate mostly on interpersonal relations and emotional themes in addition to their unspeakable vision-producing power.  2C-T-7 visions (read, not *visuals*) seem to always have some personal meaning to me, but they are not necessarily spiritual in nature.


Though not so much for me a "spiritual" psychedelic, I have had a few such experience with 2C-T-7.  Most notable was the first (an so far only) time I took the material while camping in the Roosevelt National Forest in the Rocky Mountains.  That was so fucking incredible.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  The Rocky Mountains are a very special place.


And then there are things like 5-MeO-DiPT, and even 4-Ho-DET, aka ethocin (and the acetate, 4-AcO-DET), that feel rather empty to me.  They have no real content and for me are mostly wastes of my time.  Only one ethocin trip was ever moving, and I don't think it had to do with the drug taken.  But rather the time I took it, and what was going on with me and the world then.

How has the body stimulation been for those who have tried it?  I found that it was a little uncomfortable during the first hour after the alert, but it became very pleasing afterwards.  The uncomfortable feeling may have been the fact that I was just trying to chill out in a somewhat small room.  I usually go for a walk during the onset of psychedelics.  I might also mention that sex on Iprocin was amazing for me.  The tactile and psychological effect was mind blowing for both of us.  It was a really spiritual experience.

Iprocin feels like the sexiest drug I've ever taken.  It's my "foxy methoxy."  The tactile enhancement is insane.  I can't wait to try this one with the lady.  I never found it physically uncomfortable, except the time I took 14mg.  But I think a lot of it was my body telling me I wasn't treating it well, rather than the drug.  At 20mg, 22mg, and 24mg iprocin feels very fantastic and sensual.

morninggloryseed, I would have to agree that Iprocin is a very sexy drug.  I have never had such great tactile enhancements even with MDMA or Methylone.  The entactogens just seem like an overload of excitement rather than having strong tactile enhancements.  


It was a very clean trip.  Like I said, I think my environment shaped the negative body energy during the onset.  The peak was beautiful and very comfortable as well as the rest of the trip.  I think a walk would have been perfect for the first part of the trip, but I just couldn't deal with the cold that day.

I recently sampled 20mg of iprocin. Me, after reading all the positive iprocin info, and being very excited to try it, had a horrible time. Do not get me wrong, I had a very powerful experience, but i was terrified 97% of the time. I didn't take my normal .5mg evening dose of clonazapam, and throughout the night as teh experience got stronger i felt the most horrible body feelings.


They felt like tension, jaw clenching and built up 'energy' in my body. This scared me immediately, as i didnt' think a tryptamine should make me feel stimulated in this way, and this thought stayed with me and grew throughut the rest of the night. I felt anxious, scared, and found it nearly impossible to have a good time.  I brought two seperate friends aside to 'keep an eye on me' ( I never do this, i can almost alwaysh handle my drugs, but i was very scared. I didnt' know if the scale had been off; maybe the vendor had sent the wrong chemical; maybe I'd finally done too many drugs... 


I made it through the experience and came home to 1mg clonozapam and two valerian root extract tablets... it took me FOREVER to get to bed.


Again, i DID have a POWERFUL experience, but i do not wish to go near this chem any time soon again.

I, personally, had a great experience, but I did notice some of the negative body energy.  Next time, which will be, not this Wednesday, but next, I will go on a walk during the onset and somewhat through the peak.  I believe that there is something really great about this chemical, as well as many others.  However, there are just certain aspects of them that you have to learn tricks to deal with.  With 2C-I, I cannot just "sit" and wait for it to come on.  I have to walk and let if come on as I walk.  With Iprocin, I love just sitting around once the peak is on, but during the first part, I am going to need to be more active.  I have noticed that negative body energy can lead some people into negative mindsets.

I had my first slightly sour experience on iprocin the other day as well. The body load was not the root of it, though. I think it was that during the onset I suddenly had to comfort my wife who was dealing with some long-distance family problems. It brought me to a kind of sad place that I couldn't get out of for the rest of the trip. The best laid plans....


Also, I attempted to engage in activities -- reading and music -- that I had recently found HIGHLY enjoyable on 2C-E, and I wanted to compare doing the same activities on 4-DiPT. And whaddaya know, reading is just not as fun on iprocin (or maybe any tryptamine? In general they seem not to offer the kind of clear-headed trip that can make things like reading fun. So far 2C-E is the only thing that does, for me. It sounds like 2C-C and maybe 2C-D might share this property, if not the depth of 2C-E.) 


While it's next to impossible to read on LSD, it was at least possible to comprehend a complex sentence on iprocin (maybe after reading it two or three times), but was not remotely mind-blowing, as some of the intellectual-emotional connections I kept getting while reading the same text on 2C-E. I will probably never forget some of the sentences I read on my last 2C-E trip. They have a power and meaning now that I can't describe. 


But I'll keep searching for my "ideal" iprocin activity.


I concur with Piper that walking or other outdoor exercise during the come-up of almost any psychedelic seems to improve the experience dramatically. I think it's maybe 60% the positive mindset of an outdoor setting, and 40% increased blood flow and oxygen. Just a hypothesis. But it's something I now try to incorporate into every trip preparation.

Ok, so I finally have some time to write up a little bit about my opinions of 4acodipt.  I have tried this wonderful substance about 15 times at various doses and a couple dozen other times in combinations with other rc's.  I'll proceed with an outline of my physical reactions, mental reactions, visual effects and finally comment on the plateau effect that I find with it.


Physical Effects:  I find this 4acodipt to be very edgy on the come up.  I often experience slight spasms and a cold sensation.  This isn't all bad as it often gets me prepared to stay planted for the peak of the experience.  There is usually some nausea, but not as bad as I find with mushrooms.  The only time I have had to vomit from 4acodipt was when I had to taste it either in solution or otherwise while ingesting it.  This is the most bitter rc I have come across and the taste alone gags me.  I find that valium is a nice solution to this body load, it calls the spasms without taking me out of the tripping mindset.  A couple beers also helps to take the edge off, although I should point out that I don't recommend mixing alcohol with any other research chemical.  


Mental Effects:  At lower doses I find 4acodipt the most euphoric indole that I have tried.  Its a euphoria that comes from feeling and knowing that everything is as it should be, not the sort of rushy euphoria that I get from pea's.  4acodipt is also the most gentle indole I have every tried.  It allows for a clear train of thought and I remember the entire trip.  At this lower lever there is mush less of the classic tripping feel, it really has a character of its own.  This is very characteristic of the peak and following hour.  The remainder of the trip is often more of a generic trip feeling.  I've noticed that this type of trip appeals more to experienced trippers than novice ones.  It can be so gentle as to blueball new trippers, but I am constantly amazed at how it clean of a trip it is.  

  At higher doses(I will explain more on high vs. low doses) the trip can get much different.  I tend to find myself in continous thought loops that stall out and then repeat.  It is interesting that if I am tripping with another person on 4acodipt, our stall out rythms eventually synce up and every five minutes we just stop in mid sentence.  We came to to coin this the "back in fifteen" effect since 15 seconds or so later we would both fall right back into what we were thinking/talking about.  This makes functioning very difficult and can lead to distress if there are any pressing issues.  However, even at these higher doses the trip is very gentle compared to a similar trip of LSD or mushrooms.  Even though it is gentle, it seems to lose the euphoric sense of well being. 


Visual Effects:  Again, 4acodipt is unique as a trip.  I can't really say that the visuals are like any other substance I've tried.  They typically consist of brighten colors and sparkling edges where ever there is a sharp contrast.  Morphing and floor/wall breathing is rarely a part of it, but shadows do move.  For example, the drapes may not look like they are moving, but the shadows on them do, which makes for a very interesting effect.  At high doses (the ones I don't recommend, I'll explain later) the visuals can reach full blown 600mc+ acid levels.  I've had this get to the point of shadow figures and such which are very rare for me.  The only time I see patterning is when looking a flickering candle flame, but interesting enough I always see the same pattern with 4acodipt.  


Plateau Effect:  Over my experience I have found that 4acodipt displays the so called plateau effect of a drug very well.  My early experiences with it were in the 30-50 mg range, which I find very managable.  This gives me about a 5 hour total trip with a 1 hour comeup.  This is the nice euphoric level with mild visuals.

  On nights that I venture up 50mg, I know I'm in for a different trip.  The first difference is that it starts in about half the time.  I also completely skip the light, euphoric stage of the experience and am immediatly immersed in a full mind fuck of a trip.  Time slows to a crawl and I lose my train of though every 10 minutes or so.  This is also the point where visuals go crazy as I mentioned above.  This phase will last about 4-5 hours and then the trip becomes more euphoric and the visualls slowly fade away.  All in all, a high dose can last as long as 9 solid hours for me.  

  I know that many people have commented on the apparant steep dosing curve of 4acodipt, but I find this the most forgiving rc that I have tried.  This may arise from the mixed 4ho/4aco batches going around or it may be just me and my friends, but I'll share a little story.  This is an example of sheer stupidity and irresponsibilty on my part but all the parties came out unscathed and feeling very fortunate.  After getting accustomed to the substance and its dosing via lining out a known quantity and measuring out the desired dose and transferring it to a gel cap, I got pretty good at filling a gel cap to the level that I wanted right out of the baggy.  This was a very fluffy batch and it took nearly a full gel cap for 50 mg.  This one particular night I was introducing the substance to a friend and trying a new batch at the same time.  Like a fucking idiot, I assumed that they were the same density and proceeded to fill up three caps with 25mg, 40mg and 50mg.  Then I took the 40(about 4 hours after dosing on 4acodet), my roommate took the 50 and our friend took the 25.  When we all started to trip in about half the time we were expecting and tripping  MUCH harder than expected I began to wonder.  The trip was in no way threatening to me or my experienced roommate, but our friend was completely immobilized.  When my roommate was still tripping after 5 hours (which is extremely unusual for him) I knew something was wrong.  Eventually we all came back down and no one suffered any lingering effects although the extra 5 hours of tripping caused some logistical problems.  This is why YOU NEED TO GET A MILLIGRAM SCALE FOR RC'S.  After putting the substance aside until I got a scale, I found this batch was about three times denser than the last, you can do the math…  I am very fortunate that this happened with 4acodipt and not 2ce or AMT.  I'm not implying that taking such large doses is safe, but none of us suffered any long term effects.  My friend declared this the strongest trip of his life yet he held his composure better than most times I've tripped with him.  While I certainly don't recommend that anyone attempt these doses (I haven't since) I think this says a lot for the gentle and forgiving nature of the substance.  


In summery 4acodipt is the most unique indole that I have tried to date and remains on of my favorites.  I seems to find more popularity among experience trippers who aren't after a completely mind blowing experience.  While +++ and ++++ trips are certainly possible, I find that I require a fairly large quantity to do so.  If I want that sort of a trip from it, I combine it with hallucinogens (best LSD trip of my life…) especially 2ci and 2ce.  Adding just 8mg of either PEA will feel like doubling my 4acodipt dose.  Perhaps the best thing is that you never really know what it is going to do, the same dose can feel very different for no apparent reason, but I always have a good time on it.  Remember that everyone reacts differently, so please remember that everything above is my humble opinion and observation.

I really haven't come to the conclusion as to whether 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT are that much different.  From the above report, I would have to say that my Iprocin trip seemed very much similar.  However, I had full blown visuals at just 15mgs.  The visuals were serious at some points, and just flat out cartoonish and funny at some.  At one point, I was talking to my girlfriend and the patterns in the background were turning into animated umbrellas.  Then, at another, I felt as if I was under water, and there were a bunch of fish swimming out of holes in a sunken, wooden boat.  There were sea horses playing trumpets, and random objects were coming out of the tube of the trumpet.  It was almost impossible to engage in conversation when I was seeing things like that.  The perceptual changes and vibes were mind blowing as well.  It just had a "perfect" feeling during the peak.  Anyhow, would it be worth it to purchase 4-AcO-DiPT to study the differences?  Maybe mixing the two would be a +, I don't know.  There were a couple chemicals that I was interested in, that I don't think I really want to get into anymore, like 4-HO/AcO-DET.  After trying Iprocin, I don't really find much need.  So, I don't have to spend the extra money there.

I tried Iprocin for the second time this past Wednesday at 25mgs.  I can say that I probably wouldn't go over 30mgs.  It is an intense experience, but has a certain gentle uniqueness.  During the very initial onset, the feeling is very entactogenic.  I get incredible euphoria with it.  I mentioned that the coming up last time at 15mgs was rough, and my conclusion was right.  It was because I was just sitting in a room and not doing anything.  I was on a walk during the onset of this trip, and it wasn't nearly as rough coming on.  I had another magical time.  I actually was still having CEV's the night after.  I was ready for sleep, and I noticed that there was motion when I closed my eyes.  All of a sudden, color started to form patterns of castles and animated figures.  It wasn't bright and "awesome" like during the peak of an experience, but my body was very relaxed, and it was a pleasant entertaining surprise.

Of the psychedelics I've tried, something about iprocin reminds me the most of a really mellow alcohol buzz, the kind you get from expensive scotch or red wine. It makes me feel very content indeed. The visuals are not as fantastic as 2C-E or LSD, but the mood lift is just really.... kind.


I find 40mg is about my limit. The only reason not to go above that, though, is the come-up, which I think at a higher dose would lead unavoidably to vomiting. The bulk of the trip, even at 40mg, for me is not overpowering. (I'm referring to 4-AcO-DiPT here, not 4-HO. There is a 10-15mg difference in the doseage range).

I don't know where you came up with that number. Molecuclar weight of 4-aco-dipt is 302.4 and of 4-ho-dipt is 260.5. That makes 4-ho-dipt about 16% more potent, so about 23mg of 4-aco-dipt would be needed in place of a 20mg 4-ho-dipt dose.

I was going by memory from the Erowid doseage charts. Having checked those again, I guess it's actually more like 0-10mg difference, depending on the doseage range.

AFIAK Erowid numbers aren't based on anything scientific, just their interpretation of experience reports. And note they round most everything off to 5mg, which can make a big difference with iproc(et)in.


You can consider the effect of freebase and salt thought. HCl salt adds about 36.5 to the molecular weight. So if your 4-ho is salt and your 4-aco is freebase they are about the same, but if your 4-ho is freebase and your 4-aco is salt than the 4-ho will be about 30% stronger by weight.

**Anyone tried both? Comparision please**


Well, I have a fair bit of experience 4-aco-dipt, but I'm thinking about giving 4-ho-dipt now.  From reading over this thread and all the trip reports, it seems they are different is a few ways: 4-ho-dipt is more potent than 4-aco-dipt, 4-ho-dipt is shorter than the 4-aco-dipt, and 4-ho-dipt doesn't have as many body tremors/load as 4-aco-dipt.  Is there anyone who has tried both and can confirm or add to my observations?

^^^^^^^^^^


I should have some 4-AcO-DiPT reports soon.  I will be looking into 4-AcO-DiPT specifically to explore how it is different from the free phenol.  The differences here are more than just potency.  From those who have tried both tell me, it's a similar but different trip.  I intend to put the "what is different" into the best english I am able to.

Like others I find 4-HO-DiPT has a harsh comeup usually – a crackedout ‘old’ feeling with sore muscles and poor coordination.  Super horny though, go figure!

4-AcO-DiPT by itself can be deep but it fades fast.  It has a very serious flavor to me, not a lot of goofiness or talking like with other substances.

However, I enjoyed it the most when combined with 4-AcO-MiPT.  Like 15mg 4-AcO-DiPT combined with 8mg 4-AcO-MiPT in the same capsule.  Incredible –  a combo for the ages!  No body load, very meditative but not sedating, and hyper-visual!  Fractal rainbow tracers on everything, green and blue shades all over, euphoric body sensations, lots of laughter.  A consistent (non-rolling) experience that lasted a full 7 hours.  Utterly and completely floored by music, to the extent that I was full-body gyrating to music that was purely in my head, for hours it seemed.  I came up with entire songs on the spot, probably enough to write a whole album (it seemed).  For a while I went off on a full-body drum solo (literally playing parts of my body) that got me so tranced that I had these spiritual visits from tribal drummers playing along, giving inspiration, etc.  I loved it.

I plan on posting a full trip report soon – but do I need to now?

This one’s worth repeating kids..

wow, sounds like an amazing combo, have you tried the 4-HO-DiPT/4-AcO-MiPT combo too?  or did the harsh come-up prevent that?


also, I just want to add that I didn't have a bad come-up on 4-HO-DiPT, I was actually surprised by how good it felt, like the euphoric feeling that mushrooms can bring.

As I mentioned many times before, to me, Iprocin and Iprocetyl are two completely different drugs.


Iprocin is a drug with an alarmingly harsh comeup as Santadog pointed out. This comuep subsides to leave me in an extremely psychedelic place that is VERY connected to the body and the earth. Not very visual, but extremely psychedelic. I have only tried this one once by taking 20 mg  2/3 rectally and 1/3 orally. 


Iprocetyl, on the other hand, is VERY gentle. Oral and nasal it seems the same, except the nasal route is a bit shorter yet more economic too. I have taken doses as high as 20mg insufflated, and regretted it, onlybecause I found it no different than 10 mg. 


The effects of this one are very mild. A very mild euphoria, some mild psychedelia, and a lot of empathogenesis. It is also EXTREMELY erotic, in a very DEEP sense. But there is no erotic "push" as with 5-MeO-DiPT. 


Speaking of eroticism, Iprocetyl really shines when smoked.  You smoke it just like you would 5-MeO-DMT, and no more than 5 mg is needed, IMO. This produces an almost instant, INSANELY erotic rush that lasts no more than 15 minutes (but the effects extend further). This is **the** aphrodesiac... nothing beats it, IMO.

I have tried smoking Iprocin, up to 10mg, and really got no effects...


This was by trying to vaporize it with as little heat as possible with a long glass um, well 'smoking glass device' which works great with 5-meo-dmt and other things.


I maybe felt a tiny feeling with 10mg, but really it looked like all it would do is just burn and leave a mark in the pipe (so really the actual dose i got would've been very small)...  So maybe only the Aco is smokeable?

^^ They are definitely not the same. Iprocin is much more forceful and visual. Iprocetyl is almost more of an entactogen. I have gotten visuals from iprocin as strong as those from 2C-E and LSD. Iprocetyl gives me low to mid-grade visuals. 


On my last iprocin trip, about 3-4 hours into it, I smoked a bit of cannabis, and immediately watched my computer screen, then my immediate field of vision, then my entire apartment, take on the characteristics of an animated movie set. The lines of text on my screen were spacecraft, and when I looked to my left, my living room was a jungle full of dancing plants. And I could changed the content of each scene instantly on mental command. It was like being a god. %) A foolishly grinning child-god.

I had the same experience with harsh iprocin come up. However, I found it still much more psychedelic than iprocetyl.

I thought iprocin had a very easy come-up, it reminded me of the first few times doing shrooms, there was a great body high with it.

I wouldn't describe the iprocin come up as harsh, exactly, but I remember being quite surprised by it my first time. It can be EXTREMELY stimulating. But I agree with kinetic, it's a lovely feeling. The AcO version doesn't touch it, for psychedelia or for the pure physical rush.

But keep my words in context.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's more than a foxy to me.  That is a word I associate with, what most consider, a strictly recreational psychedelic.  Iprocin does *feel* fantastic, and produces the enhanced state of sexual stimulation that 5-MeO-DiPT is said to produce for so many.


But unlike 5-MeO-DiPT, it is a fantastically deep psychedelic (even at low dosages) and has rivaled LSD at times in depth.  Iprocin was called by a friend on mine, "*God's medicine*" in the way that sacred mushrooms and other psychedelic plants were referred to as part of "God" by the shamans that used/use them.  I don't think I disagree with him either!


I found something fantastically cosmic and profound in iprocin that I can't yet name in words, but is very real and felt by others in my "circle."  This one for me has really has proven to consistently produce a rich state which (on the four times I have tried it so far) provided me with a lot of new lessons to play with.


You don't hear of that with 5-MeO-DiPT (foxy) too often.  *Some* at high dosages find it deep, but then you got a bodyload that isn't very good.  Stuff is pretty much useless in my opinion, but I'm glad others can make something good of it.


Perhaps my preconceived notions have biased me beyond my report being useful, but I have a feeling that 4-AcO-DiPT (which I have not tried yet) will be my real "foxy" since that one seems to emphasize the sensual part of the iprocin trip more, and the mental/psychedelic part less.

Has anyone mixed 4-ho-dipt with low doses of MDMA?

I love Iprocin. 16mg first time, sexy results.

I've never felt the urge to combine those two. Iprocin is, more often than not, highly euphoric for me already, and it feels like it would almost be a waste of a good roll to add MDMA to it. I usually only feel the need to add MDMA to a psychedelic that has more of an edge to it, like LSD.


But I'd like to hear the opinion of anyone who's actually tried it.

^^^^^


I feel iprocin and MDA or MDMA would make a great combo.  I plan on trying iprocin/MDA sometime this summer.

1. There isn't a specific number to give you. It would depend on how you personally are handling the subsequent weeks afterward.


2. Probably. I've yet to learn of a substance that DOESN'T do this (with the exception of maybe cannabis)


3. If you dose both drugs at the same time, I have a feeling the iprocetyl will hit first, NOT the mdma. And if you really value your safety you should be testing your 'mdma" pills out ahead of time. Caffeine and ephedrine (and actually, maybe even the mdma itself) probably *will* have an affect on the iprocetyl, so be forewarned.


4. NO! The two drugs are so vastly different from each other they barely deserve being compared to each other. If you want my advice, I say try not to go into this thinking it's going to feel like ecstasy. Just have an open mind... why do you feel the need to compare it to mdma?

**4-acetoxy tryptamines**


1 & 2

By recovery period, do you mean the time until the same dose will have a comparable effect, or time until it hits you in a wow-mindblowing effect. If the former, it's about 7 days (similar to psilocybin), if it's the latter, well nothing ever matches the first time.


3

Iprocetyl (as Church stated), has one of the fastest onsets for an oral psychedelic. You'd need to take the MDMA at least 30 mins beforehand if you want the MDMA to show first. Meth will (if ipracetyl behaves like psilocin) increase the intensity, but with more anxiety in the early stages. Ephedrine is quite simply horrible because of the anxiety generated.


4

There are lots of chemicals that would be classed as more MDMA like than ipracetyl (a lot of phenethylamines and poss some other tryptamines). Of the commonly encountered psychoactives, ipracetyl is most like psilocin (shrooms)

Hmmm, describing iprocetyl as "the best option for an MDMA type experience with more tactile sensation and greater sexual drive" is a bit misleading, if you ask me. I mean, I can see how someone might make the connection, but along those same lines, I could say that "a good deep-tissue massage is a great alternative to an MDMA experience." See, there's kind of a jump being made there, no matter how true that statement actually is...


Yes, iprocetyl will cause tactile enhancement, yes it may increase your sexual drive... but just try not going into the experience thinking it's going to be like an MDMA experience minus the empathy and talkativeness. The two experiences are very different, and if you set yourself up with a predisposition to compare the two, you might miss out on what the iprocetyl has to offer.


Trust me. The two drugs are extremely different. Hardly worth comparing to each other. If anything, I would say iprocetyl is the best alternative to a shroom trip, minus the ego-dissolution and full-blown psychedelia.

There is none!  Having sampled well over two dozen different synthetic psychedelics...I can say that statement with confidence.  Indeed, some of the ones I have tried do share some effects with MDMA over a broad spectrum of catagories (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, methylone, and even DiPT come to mind).  But none offer an experience that can even remotely be considered an alternative to the type of experience MDMA provides; not even MDMA's beta-ketone...methylone.  These chemicals are best experienced and looked towards for the unique psychedelic state each provides...not for how much alike they may be to other psychedelics such as MDMA.

I just thought I would report that a recent attempt to do this (iprocin + moclobemide) was extremely unpleasant. The physical side effects of the iprocin were magnified to a worrying degree (heart rate and blood pressure) and the mental effects were disappointing and somehow "squelched". Not recommended, or at least, proceed with extreme care.

I tried 4-aco-dipt @ 32mg last night (19mg plus 13mg 90 minutes later) and a very productive evening was had. This material is very good for inner conflict-resolution, and it's also very sensual.


I experienced nausea while I was reveiwing my psychological issues and when I felt some resolution, the nausea vanished. However, I did end up with a slight headache later in the evening but it wasn't all that bothersome.


My mood today was excellent, surprising since xmas hasn't been all that much fun.


I did get one strange effect. I took the first dose at midnight and the second 90 minutes later, expecting an experience of around 4 hours. That's why I chose 4-aces.... its short duration. But at 10am the next morning (10 hours later) I was still going strong, even after popping a 2mg melatonin to help me sleep.


I get this effect on LSD also. A normal dose will keep me tripping pretty solidly for 24 hours, sometimes more. 


I wonder if some people metabolise tryptamines differently?

Very good friend of mine has had this 'extended' tripping syndrome on a number of occasions as well. 


More often than not with tryptamines, actually: mushrooms (single dose of fresh mexican, just far too much), 5meodipt (22mg, again, this is too much, and it was also on top of e). 


But it has also happened with LSD, on a number of occasions.


With the PEA's my friend has tried so far this does not seem to happen - the only that lkasted longer than was desired was 2C-C because he had redosed toward the tail-end of the peak in a moment of euphoria and then spent hours wishing he could sleep when the euphoria left...


oh, and said friend has also tried 4-AcO-Dipt at a modest 9mgs approx., and he found it strong enough to find special meaning in the present moment and yet subtle enough to enjoy spending time in an unfamiliar setting with a (very lovable) person he did not know very well.

^^ Yes, 4-AcO-DiPT is really only "good in a social setting" at low doses. I can't remember exactly what my dose was on the trip where I decided it was a good social drug, but it was around 10mg probably.

When it comes to nitrogen substitution of phenethylamines and tryptamines, they are two differnt beasts. Most tryptamines require a tertiary amine configuration on the sidechain nitrogen in order to be active (other than the alpha-alkylated tryptamines), whereas phenethylamines require a primary amine function (except for the 3,4-methylenedioxy compounds which will work with a small N-alkyl group). 


N,N-di-isopropyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine had chance to be inactive, or at best, some sort of beta-adrenoreceptor agonist (N-isopropylphenethylamine derivatives are generally found to be beta-adrenergics. A lot os asthma drugs have that sort of configuration)

Well, there is the "MDA version" of DiPT, which is 4,5-MDO-DIPT.  It produced threshold effects at 25mg, which were said to be LSD-like.

I'd say it (coke + 4-AcO-DiPT) would depend on how much you like the mental state produced by stimulants, such as cocaine.  I do enjoy a little bit of coke now and then, but cocaine is not something I'd want to experience while tripping.  So, this is not something I'd do, but your experience may vary.

I don't like coke (actually, I don't like **me** when I've had coke, but it equates to the same thing), but my experience of mixing amphetamines with tryptamines is that it makes it more intense in a white-knuckle ride sort of way (that most probably equals more anxiety, but I really like amphetamine, so anxiety is something I just have to live with).


I haven't had 4-acetoxy DiPT, but with 4-hydroxy DiPT, amphetamine did what it does with other tryptamines i've taken (ie as described above)

I had my first experience with this chemical last friday at 22-24mg.

The body buzz is excellent, as droppedcivic mentioned. I felt very warm inside and it reminded me alot of a nice dose of MDMA. I would go so far as to say it is perhaps the best body buzz ive ever felt from a psychedelic aside from MDMA.

The visuals reminded me of mushrooms at the 2.5-3.5g level.

The mind trip was the best part though. It felt extremely erotic to me. At times i felt as if i was making love to the music i was listening to and then i would proceed to have a mental orgasm in the form of CEV that would become extremely colorful until they reached a point at which i felt as if i left my body for minutes at a time.

This comes on quick, i was peacking at the 1 hour point and down from the peak at 3.5 hours. After effects lasted up to the 6 hour point 

This is defintely a wonderful substance. I felt no anxiety what so ever yet it still felt completely psychedelic (in the mushrooms and LSD sense).

I spent the entire peak of my trip lying on the floor and smoked marijuana every 30-45 minutes (to me it felt as if a couple hours had gone by.)


In tihkal shulgin mentions how one of the trips flirted with a ++++. I too flirted with ++++ (slipping out of my body and feeling as if i dont exist {or rather not feeling anything}) but sadly all i did was flirt and it never progressed into an all encompassing ++++.

Its a great psychedelic in my opinion. It would also be good for introductions to psychedlics. 

Next time i think im going to bump the dosage to 24-28 mg.

I've tried both 4oh-dipt and 4ace-dipt several times, usually at 20-25mg. Would not be able to tell the difference, except 4ace lasts longer. But I found for me even 4oh lasts somewhat longer than the 2-3 hours quoted in Tihkal. About like an eight of good shrooms, but with less visuals. Tried snorting 4ace once, either it's much stronger that way or I misjudged the dosage, or both, because it lasted maybe 8 hours. Noticed that an ethanol solution of 4ace turned almost black over a couple months. No noticable loss of potency.

My guess is that nasal administration will work, and will be about twice as potent as oral consumption (given what all my friends have said about every other 4-HO-substituted tryptamine so far, and data we have on 4-HO-DMT oral bioavailability).


The person who snorted 20-25mg on a previous post was probably hitting the equivalent of 40-50mg oral -- a clear overdose for most people.

After reading comments here, I decided to try insufflating 12 mg. I cut it into two equal lines, blew one, waited 15 minutes and blew the other. However, I did not notice a significant increase in potency. Perhaps simply waiting 15 minutes, coupled with the quick action of the drug, resulted in such weak effects. Slight OEVs and a psychedelic head-space were the only effects, similar to a 12-16 mg dose. 


I'll try again with 12-14 mg, i think, done all at once. Interesting.

I would like to mention that miprocin also smokes quite well. Given my level of alchohol intoxication at the sime, I wouldn't venture as guess as to relative strenght, compared to other methods, but two thumbs way up!

A few months ago I received 100mg of 4-HO-DiPT, and never opened it, preferring to keep it sealed in the packaging in the fridge.  The other day I opened up the package and looked at the product, and discovered that it is a dark blue color, entirely.  Since I've never seen it before now, I don't have anything to compare it to to determine whether or not it has degraded.  Does anyone know if a dark blue color is indicative of degradation, especially consider I kept it in a cool, dark, airtight place?

Yeah, it shouldn't be dark colored at all.  I've never heard of it degrading in a airtight package in the fridge though (freezer would be better).  It's probably on it's way to a black goo.  If it's still granular and not black, there probably hasn't been too much degradation.

The blue color is a bit odd.


All 4-ho/aco tryptamines i have encountered (4 ho/aco mipt, 4 ho/aco dipt and 4 ho det) have been a greyish brown color, except for one sample of 4 aco mipt which was a crystalline white powder.


Although the blue is odd, i wouldnt worry about ingesting it. If anything you will just require a higher dose.


BTW, report beack with the effects. I have had iprocin a couple times and although it wasnt my most spectacualr psychedelic experience it provided me with the best music enhancement of any other drug (including LSD and MDMA). At times while lying on the floor listening to the grateful dead my closed eye visuals would take on a very sexual nature and i felt as though i was having sex with the music.

I havent had any in a couple years now, maybe its time to revisit.

I'll definitely report back.  I've been meaning to try it out for quite a long time now.  Either the weekend after next, or possibly late this week, I think.  Your music enhancement comment has got me more excited now... I've been looking for something to take and just listen to music with my eyes closed.  Ever had 2C-E?  How does the music enhancement compare with that?  2C-E has the incredible ability to create stunningly vivid and kaleidoscopic soundscapes.

Xorkoth,while colour is indicative of degradation,it always way overstates the degree of degradation.I posted an HPLC stability study with a methanolic solution of it:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?p=2942755#post2942755](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?p=2942755#post2942755)


"I was curious how stable this 4-HO stuff really is.5-MeO-DIPT.HCl,DPT.HCl,DMT freebase and such stuff can be stored unchanged for years at RT when protected from light.


4-Acetoxi-indol itself,storing at 0° in a brown container for about 7 years showed still a pure product according to HPLC.I've recently checked freshly obtained 4-HO-DIPT which were grey crystals with a purity >99%.The methanolic HPLC solution (2mg/ml) was let standing at RT in the light and reassayed:after 6h,it was still unchanged and colorless.4 days later a slight discoloration towards a grey/violetbrown got apparent but HPLC looked still fine,only a very little noise in the baseline starting to stick its head out.

15 days later,the solution has turned brown and the content has fallen to about 92%.As a general rule,discoloration is a valid indicator of degradation but usually overstates the degree.


I would not store unfreezed solutions of these compounds (maybe only in degassed liquid and with VitC or BHT added at 0° with no light present) for longer periods.As pure crystals I'm confident they will hold purity rather long if kept in freezer/light protected.The hydrochlorides are probably considerably more stable.Will check the 4-HO-MIPT as well now."


The Hydrochloride is way more stable,this seems confirmed now.Quick check is if its watersoluble,then its the hcl salt.

That's odd because I have a few caps of iprocin I made up in 2003, and found them this weekend when I was cleaning, and they are same color as they are the same greyish color as when I capped them.  It's been a long time, but I am near positive this iprocin is a salt, not the base.  Dunno if that makes any difference.  The caps were in my camping gear which was stored in a closet.

Fuck, I just read through this whole thread and I think I'm going to sample this material (4-HO-DiPT) tonight, at 20mg.  This thread has me looking forward to it, for sure.  I'm going to lay down on my bed with eyes closed and listen to music, and see where I can go.  I'll report back in detail.

I have a question that I could use an answer to rather quickly.  I've just attempted to dissolve my 4-HO-DiPT in water, as I could swear I heard it's soluble and that alcohol is a bad solvent to use.  However, it seems to be having a lot of trouble dissolving.  Am I just flat out wrong?  Should I add an acid?  I'm looking for an answer myself but the time draws near, and I've been unsuccessful so far.

You have the freebase, which is not water soluble.  Add an acid (a few drops of diluted acetic or hydrochloride works great).

That was interesting.  I can't really remember the entire experience.  I think I was too effective in my meditation.  I've never quite experienced music in that way, nor that exact type of thought distortion.  I had a strange sort of head tension the whole time, that bordered on painful up until rather recently.  I can't quite explain this tension, but it felt very alarming at times.  The material was visual but in a way which I'm at a loss to describe.  It made everything look as if it were alive and moving like an animal.  The intensity would fade in and out - at one point I realized I had had my eyes open for a while but had only been seeing whatever spinning tryptamine world I was visiting.


Anyway, I'm trying to sleep on it before I solidify and observations, but I'm left with a residual stimulation and a complete lack of tiredness.  Hence this post.

I got a chance to try this a couple of days ago; about 20mgs of HCl freebase.  The effects are pretty much as advertised...fast comeup, not too terribly stimulating.  I found the visuals and the headspace a little underwhelming, but not at all unpleasant.  I did experience a little nausea, which is unusual for me with tryptamies, but it wasn't too bad.


My friends and I found ourselves rather uncoordinated, and with just enough of a tryptamine jangle that we mostly wound up smoking joints to calm ourselves over the three hours.  


I'd say it was a +++ experience, not incredible, but I'd do it again.

It's either the salt (hydrochloride) or the free amine (free base), but not both.

4-Aco-DIPT is the gem IMO ... 35 mg of the HCl for a 170 lb male = transcendent ecstasy.  


20 mg of the hydroxy or the acetoxy would be underwhelming though.  This one is an anomaly in the 4 substituted tryptamine series.  4-xx-dmt, det, and mipt are much stronger as freebases than their 4-xx-dipt counterpart (strongly active at 20 mg).  I worked my way up to 40 mg 4-HO-DIPT which was quite amazing, but some excessive stimulation.  35 mg 4-ACO-DIPT was MORE AMAZING, possibly my most memorable psychedelic experience yet.  And I am someone that was totally blown away with 22 mg 4-Aco-MIPT HCl.  Up the 4-xx-DIPT dosage and you will be pleased.

Hmm... At 26mg 4-AcO-DiPT freebase I was at a strong +3 that I don't think I'd push.  The visuals weren't terribly impressive, but communication was near impossible and there was some body weirdness.


Alternatively, I think 4-HO-DET and 4-AcO-DET are on fantastic at astral doses.  I don't like to push the doses of tryptamines much anymore after a couple of my friends took seperate trips to the ER, though (on 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT).

Well, I'm no chemist :D

I just know it didn't dissolve in distilled water, life fumarate salt does.  It is the HCl salt, though.

Oh, and it was Iprocin (4-HO)...

I suppose everyone reacts differently ... good reason to always start low and work your way up.  25 mg 4-Aco-DIPT put me at a strong ++ or maybe a very light +++.  At 35 mg, the visuals, especially CEVs were absolutely stunning and there was no body discomfort.  Actually, I experienced the polar opposite of body discomfort ... best psychedelic sex enhancer I've ever come across.  And I still didn't have any trouble communicating, where as 22 mg 4-Aco-MIPT put me 100% incommunicado.

I don't know...  I've tried it a couple of more times since my OP, and I just don't feel like this offers me anything near what Miprocin gives me.  


The main advantages to Iprocin are slightly less stimulation and a shorter duration.  

On the downside, the visuals aren't nearly as impressive, I don't find the headspace quite so insightful, and with Iprocin it's hard to work up the motivation or ability to do much more than smoke weed and play with glowsticks for 3 hours (not that there's anything wrong with that).%)

Just goes to show how everyone is different.  I agree iprocin is the less visual one (compared to miprocin) but by far, the headspace is far more insightful with iprocin as compared to miprocin..in fact I didn't find any insight with miprocin at all while two of my iprocin trips verged on being +4 type trips.


Both miprocin trips were filled with warm laughter, and lots of love-making...but no deep conversations, telepathic experiences, or moments of mystical oneness.


Neither drug was stimulating but iprocin had a much stronger 'body high.'  Wonderful one at that.

**Stability issue**


I know it is best to store 4-ho-dipt at zero degrees, but if it were to be stored dry, in an airtight container, with no exposure to light at room temperature, how long do you think it would stay above 90% pure? Also, at what point of purity do you think it would  stop degrading? (I assume that even if  stored as above it would not ever degrade to zero potency)

A 99.3% pure 4-HO-DIPT (base) sample has now been stored 1 year under air at RT but protected from light.While the colour changed from the grey to brown,the HPLC purity is still 99.7%,and theres no bump in the baseline typical of degradation.

I had my first experiance with 4-Ho-Dipt this weekend. This one is an absolute gem for me. 


Amazing, euphoric body high, like pure MDMA almost but without the speedy amphetamine edge. 


Very clear headed philosophical head space. Amazing closed eye visuals, not a whole lot of open eye, a little bit of the characteristic tryptamine warping and color changing. Lots of auras and energy fields tho.


Extremely empathic and tactile enhancement.


I will post a full trip report in the near future.


This duration was definately short tho, but It was a nice change from my usual 15 hour acid trips.


Took 15mg and then a 7.5 mg booster at Time+2hours, and was in bed asleep by Time+7hours.


Namaste

are the shakes a sign of neurotoxicity? i read a repot on erowid of some guy who was getting muscle spasms for weeks after taking one dose, that would be terrible. also someone earlier on this forum said they felt "blah" for a week after their dose, i find that psychedelics usually boost my motavation and intrest in life, if ho-dipt causes some kind of mental fogging i would def avoid it.

Doubtful, though define 'neurotoxicity.'  That is a somewhat vague term.  If you could give a specific meaning to that, there may be a better answer produced.  Which neurons, and what kind of 'toxicity."


Even water is toxic at a certain concentration.

I better add my experiences with these ones. I haven't seen any reports of the dose and/or negative physical I encountered. This was over 3 years ago, before the RC vendor busts. I know I had 4-aco-dipt, though at a later time 4-ho-dipt may have been sampled. At doses 20-25mg, mostly giddiness, jitters of the thighs, minor visual affect/fluidity.


Laughing comes too easy, which both made it hard to un-tense the smile muscles (thus the name for this compound "smileys"), and for some fellow experimenters, paranoia (weirded out by drug-induced permagrin).


At 60mg (again, pretty sure it was 4-aco-dipt, but something is telling me it may have been the 4-ho variety), an uncomfortable, almost painful spasm of one of the muscles inside the ear. I have recently found this to be the "acoustic reflex", responsible for closing the ear when sounds get too loud, or when chewing; during the trip this was manifested as a whooshing sound and muscle twicting feeling [in the ear], this also sometimes occurs naturally in response to really bright lights or yawning, and as a "reflex" it felt like wincing during the trip, from excesses of audio that didn't exist, but felt that way to my ears, anyway.


After an hour of uncomfortable, frequent "ear thing" reflexes (once every five seconds at most), this effect subsided and I was left to enjoy very complex CEVs, much like what was experienced on a lower dose of miprocin. One notable aspect of these CEVs was the patterns being of translucent colors, with blinding white light shining through like sun through stained-glass, alternating between very brilliant white light and colored RGB or CMY. This was quite remarkable and one of my more memorable "eye candy" experiences.

I thought i would post this here considering it is not quite a trip report but just some input on this substance.

4 ho dipt- tried it a couple times and found no nausea and the chemical is quite pleasant.

well last night i decided to dose some-


weighed out 26mg and ate it w/ some vitamin c. 

T+1hour ...IM 80mg of ketamine

as for the expierence...well the 4hodpit added much color and intellegencge to my khole.

I dont think i have been that far in a khole (and have been in many)

I was flowing thru the fabric of time/space.....which was beautiful mandalas and such.

Wow! i went further down the rabbit hole.....my sitter say i was shouting out things, (which i dont remeber)....

One thing he told me i said was "the answer to the universe is nothingness!"

hmmmm...well thought i would add this to this thread....please delete if pointless


btw...i found this combo much better than lsd+K

if nothingness is pointless....that means without boundaires...and without boundaries are we not able to construct our own reality(to an extent)?


nothingness=everything

Is getting a boner a serious challenge on 4-aco-dipt, and if so, is it more or less than MDMA? Because sometimes on MDMA I need to seriously concentrate.

4-AcO-DIPT is the best sexual enhancer there is!  MDMA lets you feel the love, but doesn't help with the "making love."  4-AcO-DIPT has no problems in that department.  I think it's more deserving of the name ecstasy than MDMA. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

This stuff is highly dependant on setting. It is amazing in a moderate dose (>20mg) at a concert. The duration is about perfect for this use.

Erowid has something to say about the decomposition of 4-AcO/HO-DiPT I believe.


I also believe that 4-AcO/HO compounds fair better for the long term if kept cold and dry, dry as in powder form. I think the fumarate salts that have become popular are more stable than the HCl salt (there may be mention of 4-AcO-DMT fumarate lasting for several weeks in liquid), but that is just me thinking. If you have a sizable amount, I would only dissolve as much as I were willing to lose, or dissolve only what you are planning on using and keep the rest cold and dry.

Well I sampled this one for my first time at 22mg (hcl salt) on Friday night..  Technically Saturday AM as it was 12:40 at the time of drop...


I'll continue this tomorrow, I need a couple days to wrap my head around it.  I'm fine, and nothing particularly crazy happen to me, but wow my buddy..  He lost it and thought I was DEA out to get him..  I'm going to try my best and write up a massive TR on the whole of the ngiht.  


Besides my most intense DMT experience, I have never felt something so humbling.


I was fine, and holding together, if it wouldn't have turned out bad for him, this would have been a very powerful mystical experience I feel.

BTW I haven't forgotten, I've been just a little pre-occupied the last day and today to write one up..  I will though, as I'm probably the only one clearheaded enough to truly capture what happened.  Even then from taking a little xanax on the comedown, I've felt out of of since Friday night.  Hopefully today will make it better and you can expect a fully (to the best of my ability) detailed TR, the 2nd I've ever wrote.

Here is the best recollection I can give you of the events of Friday night, my first experience with 4-HO-DiPT.  This was a very intense experience, and would have been mystical if things had turned out differently.  So the plan was to take 20-22mg of the iprocin a piece and then do bumps of ketamine through the night.  My friend has tried it a couple times prior, minus the K that is.  We expected a strong but relatively casual trip for the night.


*Side note stuff*


Ok, we all love psychedelics so we all know about how weird coincidences and synchronicities.  So a couple weird things happen that lead up to this.  My buddy, who sells pot, and thats all he does.  Someone breaks into his house to jack his safe expecting to get oh probably a pound or so of pot and maybe some money..  Instead, they come at the perfect and worst timing, when the safe is empty of pot, but just happens to have 130 pills of ecstasy we just 'threw' in there real quick because we had to leave..  This is right after getting the 130, had them in possession for like 2 hours.  Nobody knew about them, they just coincidentally stole the safe expecting pot, but got a bunch of pills instead..  So then the next day, someone I don't know, but a I guess you would say AFOAF, gets robbed at gunpoint for $6000 worth of coke by some Pakistanis or something..  --  All of this is just really coincidental, and not connected..  


** Trip part (but the stuff above is kind of relevant) **


**T+00:00:00**  I ingest 22mg iprocin in a little gatorade.  OF consumes 20mg at roughly the same time.  Both of us notice instant placebo and can tell that 'something' is different.


**T+00:10:00**  We are feeling a little something, my body feels great, like being stoned.  I pack up a pretty fat bowl and we go outside.  Smoke it over the next 10 minutes.


**T+00:25:00 ** We are coming up pretty nicely at this point, I feel great.  Since we had planned to do some K during the night, we decide to just get started.  I go for about 45mg of the S-isomer.  OF does roughly the same amount.


We start the movie "Howl's Moving Castle" and I begin to zone completely.  I've never felt ANYTHING like this, wow it's amazing.  We wait just a few more minutes, giddy and laughing because it just feels so great.


**T+00:40:00**  I feel the full effects of the bump of K, I have some nasty drip that causes a pretty quick *whap* vomit that makes me feel a little queasy for a few minutes.  After my stomach calms I decide to snort the rest of my 100mg of K I set out, so 55mg.  


After this, things get a little hazy.  I must say, at this point, before it goes sour.  I feel amazing, I'm watching this movie, and it's so real..  The dissociative properties of the K mixed with the strong psychedelic effects of the iprocin...wow.  I feel what I'm watching is whats real, and the stuff around the box of 'reality' is all the hallucinations.  It's pretty dark, and I say let's turn on the light.


Then..  My buddy just snaps, and goes "oh my god I fucked up".  Not sure in what order these thoughts occurred, nor does it matter.  But the next 2 hours went something like this:


One minute, I'm one of the Pakistani's that robbed the guy for coke, and I'm just setting him up to rob his house of everything.  I'm trying to signal them by turning on the light.  Then I'm DEA trying to bust him.  Or me and his GF are actually dating, and its all just a scheme to set him up..  He kept saying it's 'acting out like a play' or something like that.  He was crazy and mumbling so hard to say really.


He freaks out and runs up stairs..not sure how, the K should have had him pretty stumbly.. and turns off all the lights.  We spend the next 2 hours sitting in the dark, him mumbling shit about me being DEA, then his girlfriend was DEA also, and then we were in on it together..  Then I was his brother and his GF was his sister, and we were a 'fake' family, just to set him up to go to prison for using psychedelics..


After it had been about 2 hours after consuming he was starting to realize he was just tripping and freaking out.  He asked for a xanax, I had 12x 2mg capsules weighed out.  Gave him one, he PRETENDS to eat it and throws it away.  Remember, I can't see, its total darkness still..  He's still a little uneasy, but he comes down enough to realize i'm not trying to feed him poison.  We both eat 2mg xanax each.  We talk about the nighs events/realizations, eat a little more xanax. --  This is where my memory stops -- We smoke some more pot, eat a little more xanx.  Then I wake up extremely late the next day.


** End of trip **


On a lighter note, for you adventurous psychonaughts, 4-HO-DiPT + Ketamine is a godly combination.  I plan to try it again and under better circumstances..

I just wanted to point out, so people don't reply with certain comments..  No body planned to steal the 130 pills, that was just coincidence, some douchebag was trying to steal prob what he thought was going to be a pound or so of pot.  It wasn't staged or anything, this is my best friend, well 1 of my only 2 best friends so I know I can trust him.  They were his anyway that got jacked, so he has no reason to lie..  Anyway, the other kid, the one that got robbed for the coke.  I don't know him at all, I just heard the story because I know someone that knows someone that knows him or whatever, you get the point.  Anyway. all the stuff just lined up into a perfect coincidence and I can see why my friend thought what he did.  


But I just wanted to state that I don't hang out with hardcore drug dealers and shit, the pills we just happened to have because like we order RCs off the net, I get my pills off the net and just get enough to keep for myself or a LONG time.  Since they are so cheap, hence why we had 130, for 2 hours at least.


I guess I just wanted to say that a bunch of bad shit happened for no apparent reason, not that we are weird shady/untrustworthy people that people would try and rob or steal from..  But LOL, I guess I probably don't have the best handle/nick when I say something like that, but lol, oh well.  I guess someone was just an opportunist on the safe, it was most likely this kid that doesn't like us.  He was just trying to steal the safe full of pot..  God damn that fucker, hopefully nobody gets sick off those pills or something because they're stupid and dont know what they're doing.

I know that everyone reacts differently to substances but what would really be the pros and cons of 4-HO-DiPT ?

How soluble is it in EtOH or dH2O?

I don't really like the crazy feeling of mushrooms but I do love acid. I think its great this substance doesnt last that long but can you easily have mindblowing experiences on it that arent as difficult as mushrooms???

^^ try pushing it up to 40 or more mg.  the hcl is a fair bit weightier than the freebase.  this stuff can be boring if you underdose.


it's pretty soluble in ethanol and solns of ethanol and h2o, both the salt and the freebase, the salt is more easily dissolved in water but it can still be a pain

I acquired iprocin (4-ho-dipt) lately. I think I understand what Shulgin meant when he says the experience lasts about 3 hours after ingestion. I tried it at 2, 8, 13, 17, 25 and 30 mg. It was mostly inactive under 10 mg, interesting from 13 to 20 mg... really interesting at 25 mg and mind-blowing, very euphoric and visually breathtaking at 30 mg. For about three hours, I just felt amazing and lost in thoughts that I can't grab anymore. After three hours, I feel I am coming down and it gets boring annoying after an hour or two. And I have a lot of trouble getting decent sleep even when I dose in the morning... also I tried mixing it with 4.5 mg hydergine (again at 30 mg) and I dunno but it was very strong. The visuals were seemed a lot more intense, they were Third Eye everywhere ... just my two cents, gotta go back to chemistry class.

When I did 30 mg iprocin, it was deep and quite visual and introspective, and it seemed like I needed to go a little farther to enter another dimension, for the world to reveals itself. Last night, I took 40 mg with a nootropics regimen (1200 mg piracetam, 4.5 mg hydergine, 250 mg centrophenoxine). Visually it got so deep I would enter another dimension and everything was made of gigantic entities creatures-like. I felt watched, the world felt so alive. It was beyond the patterns. I kept entering this visionary state in waves. Each time I was so amaze. I felt so happy, so content about everything. Now it's hard to remember what happened, it's like I all forgot. I just know it was the most beautiful thing. I feel like I want extremely deep this time, between +3 and +4. This stuff is amazing! I feel so refresh now.  I didn't read anything concerning entities in iprocin reports. I don't think I would want to go deeper... maybe just a little bit. Best stuff I have done in a while... life is good ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've had both substances and they're both extremely similar.  4-Acetoxy is much smoother and longer lasting.


I've tried 18-22 and 30 mg, respectively.

The two are nothing alike.  Polar opposites in the way 5-MeO-DMT and DMT are different.  I cannot put the differences into words, but iprocin seems quite unique compared to the other 4-substituted tryptamines.

The 5-meo-dmt vs DMT thing helps a bit.  Thanks.

**First Time 4-Acetoxy-DiPT**


Planning on taking 4-acetoxy-dipt this friday, searching threads has not got me the information I was looking for---alot of 4-HO-DiPT---so I was just wondering about recommended doses, 20 mg? 30 mg? 


And please, only comment if you've actually done 4-ace-dipt, no 4-HO-dipt comments here. Thank you.

IME it differs a lot from person to person. I think you should start out by taking 15 mg. orally. Perhaps you'll barely feel anything, but for some people this is enough.  I now a guy who has to do around 50 mg. nasally to achieve full effects, however this is a HUGE dose for me and most others. My sweet spot is around 30 mg. orally, but as I said, start out by taking 10-15 mg. You can't be too careful ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have and I loved it. Very intense at ~22mg. Lots of residual speediness at the end. If you've very familiar with psychedelics 30mg ought to be alright. If you're not completely sure of your footing in that space then I would suggest starting at  somewhere closer to 20mg. (Let me add that I am NOT a hard head.)

Merged in a very interesting topic involving 4-AcO-DiPT.  Don't fear that your topic will be lost because this thread doesn't get many hits. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And I also just realized that I need to go through and separate this into 2 threads, one for each substance.  4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-DiPT are not, after all, the same.

skatardude10, very interesting, I've had incredible results with chakra/kundalini on LSD using the meditative drumming of Layne Redmond...I have no comment on your star comments, but on friday-saturday, 12-13 September 2008, I consumed 30 mg of 4-Aco-DiPT, performed the Neophyte Meditation of the (0)=[0] grade of the G.'.D.'. and was *floored*, connected right up with 'the Cosmic AUM', to quote from my notes, "There was *a lot* of energy here, pulsating, faint, then vibrating my whole body - AUM."

Took 20mg(4-aco-dipt) orally and my legs wouldn't stop shaking for the first 1.5 hours.  It was so annoying that I couldn't enjoy the buzz at all during the come up.  After the come up the trembling stopped for the most part.  Not much visuals, body buzz felt like foxy.  Music sounded "Chopped and Screwed", about an octave lower with an echo.  Couldn't decide if I liked the music warp or if it was weird.  Sex was great, like AMT but no erection problems or trouble with completion.  Very powerful orgasms, girlfriend almost blacked out and twitched for about 2 minutes after her orgasm. The problem with this substance is getting the dose right.  During the come up I feel like I should of took less, because it felt so dirty.  After the peek I felt like I needed more because it wasn't powerful enough. Thinking was very analytical, and music was different, but mostly just a   body high.  Like it for sex, cant see taking it for anything else unless I find a better method of using it....

Klonopin is clonazepam right? IMO it's a waste of drugs to take benzos when on a psychedelic. I dont think theres any point in doing that unless you're in some horrible place and want to get the hell out of there fast. All people react differently to different drugs. Maybe your body doesnt take kindly to this substance, and that is something you may have to accept. There quite a few similar drugs out there, so I suggest you try some of those instead of killing your trip with benzos ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

i'm guessing you mean the onset is more gradual and easier to handle .... because there seem to be a lot of reports of uncomfortable body load with the ACO.

It doesnt last long enough to be of any real worry and other than that one time for me. I have never had any even mild natured bodyload issues even on +25 mg doses other than once. Its never anything that a little centering, meditation, breathing excercises, cold weather, some physical activity or a combination of such couldnt easily take care of untill the initial intensity passes... Of course given the right mindset. I never tried the 4ho, but the 4-aco has always been extremely easy with me for the large part, compared to say 2ce and even 2ci. It's very gentle.

well that's good to hear. but i'm opposite in that my body is usually ok with phens - it's the tryptamines that cause unpredictable spazzing.


what you describe sounds like a pretty avg body load for most psychs, but there are people talking about the violent shakes and other sketchy side effects. and that's why i was curious re hammilton's use of the word "smooth". it seems to be at odds with popular opinion, so i was hoping for some clarification.

I haven't experienced any uncomfortable body-load either. I've done it in doses up to 40 mg., but I've never experienced any greater side effects. Compared to other psychedelics such as 2C-E and LSD, I think it's quite gentle (there seems to be another consensus about LSD, but we're all different I guess).

Just took my first foray into 4-AcO-DiPT today at 15mg of the HCl salt orally. Wow was it a lot stronger than I was expecting. I don't think I could have gotten up and walked around at the peak, which involved some ego splitting. For instance I had thoughts of telling myself things when I met me (thinking I was two different individuals completely). Took me off guard for sure, but I loved it.


Very shaky physically, yet I didn't feel very stimulated. Like my mind was unaware of my shaking body. It also made me cough quite a bit, like I was physically ill, which kind of scared me a bit. I think ~20mg would leave me unaware of reality completely. Next time I think I'll take 10mg and see if that lets me walk around and explore the world, as oppose to lying in bed.


If I had to compare it to any of the tryptamines I've tried I'd have to choose DMT, which is weird (I've tried Mushrooms, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DPT, DiPT, AMT and DMT from the tryptamine world.) I think that was just because of the intensity though.


It's interesting how my sensitivity varies so much to different things.


Normal sensitivity:

LSD

5-MeO-XXX

DiPT

AMT

2C-I,C,21,2

DOM

DOC


Very sensitive:

4-AcO/HO-XXX

DMT

2C-E


Very random?


Oh yes, I also have 4-Pro-DiPT, so I'll be trying that at some point and directly comparing the two.

I have tried 4-Aco-DIPT twice, and I definately want to explore it again....but not just yet.  The first time i did it was just 10 mgs, i got a +1, I remember there being some slight tension in the neck and shoulders, and i felt like I had a little extra jittery feeling in my legs when i walked around, but it was mostly unnoticeable).  I noticed there was a significant social-enhancement at this dose.  I  was just chilling with my roomies and would get a little more into conversations than normal, and was really really interested in what everyone was trying to say, even though i couldn't really listen to everyone all at once, which was a little bit confusing.  All in all, i noticed it in my body for about 3 hours.  I was pretty excited to up the dose the next time once it was all over.  


I can't remember my exact dose of the second experiemnt, but it was more than 25 and under 30 mgs.  I started with 15 mgs, and then I i boosted with 12 or 13 mgs at the 1.5 hour point.  The onset was quite quick, so was the comedown.  All in all, i was under the infuence of 4-ACO-DIPT for a total of about 6 hours, longer than I expected it to last.  This was quite a bit more intense than my 10 mg trial, and the effects seemed to have taken off in quite a different direction than I thought they would have.  I noticed significant body tremor.  There was a generalized shakiness of the body, and a racing heart.  There were some minor visuals, mostly they were unimpressive though.  I remeber being quite weired out my the body weirdness, and mentally i was in a very fragile and open state of mind.  When i say fragile, i mean I was in a very "sensitive to what other people say" and my own thoughts seemed to carry more weight to them - it definitely had a theraputic/opening quality to it.  It was a very honest state of mind, no confusion, didn't seem to affect ego too much.  I remember thinking a lot of my usage of psychedelics, and why I use them as much as I do.  This second experiment was about a week after my first 10 mg trial, and it really felt as though the 4-Aco-DIPT didn't really totally unfold for me at this dose (which I felt was too high for me).  


Overall, my impressions of 4-aco-dipt are that, I feel like this is a drug I will need to have a "reason" to take when I have something I want to work through with the aid of psychedelics, as oppose to something to take when I get that general tripping urge, which I enjoy using mushrooms, LSD, and 2C-E for.  t seemed as though it was a valuable headspace with a lot of potential for valuable insights, but absolutely zero recreational potential.  The body weirdness was pretty intense.  But mostly, the waters remain untested, and I will keep my research posted here. 


Oh, and i guess i should add my 4-ACO-DIPT is pretty fluffy, yet clumpy white powder.  Hasn't degraded at all in any way since I got it 3 months ago.  And it is hands down the WORST chem i have ever had the chance to taste, terrible lingering bitterness that was impossible to wash away with fluids.

Can anyone comment on how 4HO/AcO-DiPT's effects on sound compare to those of DiPT? From descriptions of c. 20 mg doses of the former, it sounds to me like you get the low-dose/early effects of DiPT (like the first hour of coming-up auditory effects of a c 85 mg DiPT dose for me, or what I'd imagine - by extrapolation - the peak of a 30 mg DiPT dose might be like); i.e. low-pass filtering, so that voices and other sounds sound a lot deeper, some phase-shifting perhaps, but not vocoding of voices, or normally consonant music becoming dissonant, or nonlinearly stretched in the frequency spectrum... Is that right, or have I missed/misunderstood people's descriptions of these higher DiPT effects? If so, what dosages of 4-HO or 4-AcO-DiPT tend to produce which level of auditory effects?


Also, are closed-ear audials (perceived sounds in objective silence) noted in these substances, and - if so - at what doses? 


I'm sorry if I've missed answers to these questions in earlier posts in the thread; feel free to urge me to use the fucking search engine, if you feel I should have. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I never had any effect on sound from 4-AcO-DiPT, even at higher doses.

i noticed no real auditory distortion but extreme **enhancement** ie the rain sounded normal but impossibly detailed and beautiful. i really dislike 4-aco-dipt except at lowish doses, its probs my least favorite tryptamine. it could have colored the experience somewhat but a friend described it as "depressing mushrooms" and when i got the chance to try it that was really the flavor. i call it the melancholy mushroom

Ah, interesting, thanks, both! I think I'd be tempted to risk melancholia to explore these rather unDiPTich auditory effects (if I get any - sounds like there's a fair amount of individual differences with this). I think it was in skatardude10's posts that I read of the low-pass bass-enhancing effects. Can you say whether the enhancement you experienced was noted more at low, middle or high pitches, or was it general, hamhurricane?

the enhancement was not localized in any one range of pitch, i think if your looking for interesting auditory effects your going to be pretty limited to DiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, and maybe 2-Me-5-MeO-DiPT. believe me after trying DiPT i went on a similar journey to the one i think your going on, i developed a theory about infrasound and DiPT and went to great lengths to test it, for me it was like getting bitten by a bug i became obsessed (and still am my obsession is just on hold) you will find aspects of the DiPT experience in several other drugs but it would seem none come close to DiPT (that we know of yet!).


EDIT: although the effects dont appear until the chains are in that one position but few of the asymmetrical butylated trypatmines have been tested perhaps some would retain or enhance the auditory component something like IPIBT or IPSBT would probs show activity although the dose might be over 100mgs.

When I took 20mg 4-aco-dipt I can say that music did sound "Chopped and Screwed", meaning everything sounded lower in pitch with a slight echo.  I just didn't like the shaking in the legs that it caused during the first 1.5 hours.

When you say 'lower', do you mean like it was in the wrong key, but still roughly the same pitch; or do you mean that it was still in the right key, but deeper-sounding? 'Cos, with low-dose DiPT, at any rate, I think these are two separate things: a relatively small (a matter of semitones) drop in frequency, and a low-pass filter that makes things sound much deeper without actually shifting their frequency spectrum as such. The echo sounds interesting; I don't think I've noted anything like that on DiPT. Sounds kind of like auditory tracers.

Ah. *shudders at the thought of it* I really didn't like that on 2C-C, which gave me big leg-shakes. Then again, DiPT has given me the shakes at 100 mg doses, and I've not minded so much (felt too pleasant in other ways, I guess), and 2C-B (at 26 mg) would have given me the shakes during the come-up, if I hadn't been too busy prancing around at great speed. If instead I'd been sitting down, I reckon I'd have been quite jittery (like parkinsonian jitters, I think I get these jitters worst when resting).

Heh, I am indeed quite obsessed with DiPT at the moment. It is a beautiful thing, and a thing of great academic interest. Infrasound? Do you mean, that DiPT stretches the frequency spectrum in such a way as to make sounds that are normally below the range of human hearing audible? That would be most interesting, if so... is this what you meant? What results did you get from your tests of it? 


It's strange that so many of the known psychedelics have major distorting effects on vision, and so few have equivalently major distorting effects on audition. I'd love to know what it is about its structure that lets it into the auditory cortex (or wherever DiPT does its thing): perhaps chemically-unrelated compounds which shared the key features of DiPT's shape or charge or whatever could be developed? I suppose there are other auditory-distorters (2C-E doesn't leave auditory perception untouched), but not - if I'm not mistaken - in quite such a thorough way.

Interesting! I think I'll wait till I've explored DiPT more thoroughly, before I get some untested tryptamines synthesized, but it's tantalizing to consider the possibilities. It seems implausible to me that DiPT - as an auditory psychedelic - cannot be 'improved on', or at least expanded on and diversified from.

I wouldn't say low pass filtering is whats ocurring...That implies a discrete cutoff which should then easily enough be able to placed on a frequency graph. I almost think, that what is occurring, is akin to lowering the sample rate on digital sound (or slowing down a tape recorder)....Less detail is given to the harmonics of the sound, leaving the fundamental frequnecy intact and thus emphasised.


Personally, I found DiPT unpleasant, but that was one trial. 4-Ho-DiPT is a lot nicer; I do get some tinnitus normally which this enhanced as well as putting it in my left, as opposed to right ear- plus music enhancement; music was more fluid. One thing which could account for what sounds like slapback echo could be the so called Haas effect; the differene in amplitude of sound entering each ear allowing us to give the sound a location; if there is less feedback between each audio hemispheric brain region, perhaps a sound that would normally be coloured according the to Haas eefect will actually be heard as two distinct sounds, one from each ear...? I dunno...


Its very interesting. I must try out plain DiPT again.....Would you think that the possible low pass filtering is an act of physical non arousal- ie. ear hairs just not moving fast enough aymore, or psychic muting- ie. after the sound has entered the ears; higher frequencies are cut by the brain for some reason.......

I have recently acquired some 4-aco-dipt, and I really enjoy this material.  I am able to push the dose pretty high, and I usually have pretty amazing out of body experiences.  


I once took 28mg at T+0:00, then 20mg at T+1:30, and another 15mg at T=2:00.  Amazing material.  It reminds me of a strong mushroom trip minus the negative side-effects reported by many people (paranoia, nausea, general malaise, etc...)


The only side-effect I dislike about 4-aco-dipt is the tremors/shaking of the muscles, especially in the legs (specifically the thighs, for me).  However, it does not bother me very much.  Actually, it sometimes feels pretty good, like being wrapped in a warm blanket ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have also had experiences with 4-ho-dipt, and I can say with certainty that they are very different experiences... at least for me.

Can you add what those differences are?  I've tried iprocin many times, and it's among the best of the best for me (I don't like mushrooms, never had pure psilocin, so iprocin and psilacetin are my tryptamines of choice).  But I've never tried my sample of 4-AcO-DiPT and I am very curious as to what it offers.

It has been several years since I have done iprocin, but I remember it providing a very strong mental trip with not much visual action (at least for me).  The mental aspect of iprocin is certainly more intense than that of iprocetyl.  Perhaps 'intense' is the wrong word... I suppose I could say that iprocin required more 'focus' than iprocetyl, if that makes any sense.


For me, iprocetlyl produced visuals that were very similar to mushrooms, and perhaps even more intense.  High doses (35+mg) produce an almost out of body experience, and an extremely colorful and playful mental landscape.  It is very fun stuff, but much 'lighter' on the mind than iprocin.


Personally, I absolutely love this stuff.


Side note - if I had to compare iprocetyl to any other tryptamine, I would compare it to miprocin (which I also love!!!)

psilacetin (4-acetoxy-dmt) is much more visual, shorter acting and less forcefully positive than iprocetyl (4-acetoxy-dipt) in my experience.  


Does anyone know if, and how quickly the metabolic process converts these acetoxy compounds into their hydroxy counterparts?

It is likely that this varies a great degree from person to person due to differing concentrations of the involved enzymes, which would explain hugely different timescales of the effects of drugs like 4-aco-dmt.  People have reported durations from 2 hours to 7 hours, perhaps in the those with shorter durations psilocetin is entering the brain without any conversion.

**4-Acetoxy-DiPT not pure?**


Hi guys, is 4-Acetoxy-DiPT suppose to be like clumpy white powder (similar to DXM powder)? 


Also, how fast does it degrade if stored in a small air tight baggie?


Lastly, can it be vaporized like 5-meo-MiPT?


TIA

Mine is kind of clumpy, off-white, but it's still damn good shit :D


Being a 4-sub-tryp it might degrade is stored at room temp in a baggie for a long time.  Look up the big and dandy storage thread in the psychedelic drugs index at the top of the forum for a better answer.  Best way is to store it in an airtight container that does not allow light penetration, with some dessicant inside it, in the freezer.


I doubt it could be vaporised.  4-subs are known to breakdown with heat.  Oral works just fine for me, one of my favorite materials. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tried 4-aco-dipt for the first time this weekend. I started off with 18mgs and felt almost nothing except a light body feeling 2 hours later I took another 10mgs then waited 30mins and decided to take another 8mgs. 

I sat down and watched Alien Dream Time and though I felt pretty good I don't think I really made it past a light ++.  I really feel like there should have been more to this experience but I never really got to where I wanted to go. The Next time I take it I'm going to take between 22-25mgs because I know there is a steep dose curve on this one and I don't want to go to far until I have a fare grip on what this sacrament has to offer.

I am not a hard head, and ~22mg of 4-AcO-DiPT was great. That as it is, if you're the type that can take 20mg 4-AcO-DMT and wish you took more, you may consider 25-30mg of 4-AcO-DiPT. I mention this in case your supply is limited. I am also susceptible to falling into the rabbit hole after being pushed to the precipice by some of these compounds, groping formless from the peak to the rebirth of baseline, and after several trials, this compound never took me there. It did produce a stimulated confusion that had me awash in liquid crystal light; shipwrecked on a glassy prismed peak, I swam to baseline through wet color. 4-AcO-DET was more immersive, assuming that it is still available.

I cannot wait to sample some... 


Sounds incredibly intriguing. 


How would one say this stuff compares to 4-aco-dmt?

Couldn't tell you that.


just keep in mind this one has a steep dose/response curve.  It can cause shaky tremors if the dose is too high.  It also hasthe potential to make you ridiculously horny.

I have only two trials with 4-AcO-DiPT.  At first it was 10 mgs, it was pretty nice.  Social, some muscle tightness in the shoulders, but very nice.


The second time i can't even remember my dose.  I think I did like 11, then i redosed like 23 or something ridiculous.  Anyways, I did NOT have an easy time.  It was reckless, but I was okay.  It actually ended very hilariously.  


We were just over our really scary peak, and decided to go for a walk.  As soon as we are walking out the door, our roomates new friend Vonda shows up TOTALLY hammered.  She was so drunk, i thought she was a severe alcoholic native on benzodiazepines, turns out it was a lovely italian lady with the most intense energy possible.  Anyways, we didn't end up going for a walk, but we did manage to help Vonda up from the bottom of her really sorry state.


In retrospect, 4-Aco-DiPT is gold, very peculiar ally though..  DO NOT taste this one, it tastes SOOOOOOO BAD.  Just a warning.  It can be a harsh teacher.


Underground Troll and I were quite shaken by its intensity.  I bet it has a wonderfully playful side though.


I think tonight i will add some 4-AcO-DiPT to my already going 5-meo-mipt/2C-E/ketamine combo, will report back !

You see i am extremely interested in this substance for its intensity and brevity.


I don't think this substance is going to be anywhere near as taxing as DPT or 2c-e.


I personally really enjoy strong visuals.

The Short duration is what has actually drawn me to this product.

Doses up to 25mg have not produced OEV but have produced fantastic CEV's.  To me, they resembled the neon square + line geometry of mescaline in the way that the the shapes and designs unfold in the mind's eye.  One of the main differences was the ability of the CEV's to represent the body's inner systems.  For example, one CEV i remember distinctively was  a rotating 3d picture of my brain.  I could see electrical impulses traveling throug it.  As i performed some activity, had a thought, or changed an emotion I could literally "see" the electrical impulses directed to the parts of the brain responsible for each change.  I also recall stretching and exercising and "seeing" my muscles, bones, tendons, and ligaments stretching and working in brilliant colors in my mind's eye.  


Imagery was also closely tied to music.  Dead Can Dance conjured visions of gothic cathedrals and secret groups meeting in hidden caverns.  My wife's Beyonce threw me into the middle of a loud construction zone then a large arena concert with pyrotechnics and expensive production.  It was like music = astral projection to an environment controlled by the music.  Almost all of this imagery, with the exception of the exercise, was seen/felt with closed-eyes while stationary.


The cons of this chem are the muscle tremors and the racing thoughts/wakefulness/schizo mind-state that persists even after the primary effects wear off.

ive had one experience at 22-24mg.

it was barely visual. Some breathing and color enhancement but nothing mind blowing.


I found it to be highly euphoric and erotic both mentally and physically, at times exclaiming how physically i felt better than mdma. and it went great with music. I spent the entire trip (2 or so hours) laying in bed listening to music feeling amazing.


As far as being like 4 aco dmt. i find the two to be completely different.

Iprocin was just a euphoric, recreational high while psilacetin is a deep powerful ally.

Iprocin isn't just a recreational high though.  Shulgin himself had a near ++++ on Iprocin did he not ?  Even though it might not lend itself to cosmic revelations, it can cause deep psychedelic experiences.  This one just has a very complex language.  It is a strange teacher.


I said Iprocin here, I should mention that I have only tried Iprocetin

This one does have a strange character indeed.  4-AcO-DiPT sometimes seems to be mild and recreational but if I lie down and meditate this one has the potential to bring me very deep, very fast.  Lots of strong carrier waves on this one and I've knocked on the doors of ++++ with it also.  I wouldn't be surprised if more practice with it produced reliable ++++'s.

well my G-unit (lols)

of 4-aco-dipt arrived today, i will be conducting some tests shortly.


Hopefully nothing bad happens.


You see, i am one to lie down and meditate on these substances.

Thats about the only thing i really do, i am not a very recreational user of these substance.


But i do enjoy 5-meo-mipt at work. lol. Call Center job is so much easier...


anyways, Trails shall begin probably around 20mg... maybe 25..


All depends if it feels as eletrically violent at 4-ho-mipt, 

4-ho-mipt raised my blood pressure ridiculously.

I would suggest starting at 15, see how that does it.  The body load with 4-xx-Dipt can be quite intense.

I have had a lot of experience with 4-aco-dipt, and it is surely one of my favorites.  I find that it allows my mind to really explore psychedelic thoights while staying pretty clear-headed.


I also find that this stuff goes great with methylone.  I have tried the 4-aco-dipt both before, during, and after the methylone.  All seem to be great, but I would probably prefer dosing them simultaneously, then redosing the 4-aco-dipt about 2-3 hours later.


This stuff is great!  I really enjoy pushing the limits with it... it is good for that ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I get them as well.  It helps to keep the dosage on the lower side.


The worst side effects I had where I was actually contemplating calling a friend to take me to the hospital was actually in combo with methylone.


I took 130mg and 25mg 4-aco-dipt about 3 hours later.  I puked, then got tremors, and got sharp electric sensation in my brain and felt like I was on the edge of a seizure; gladly it never came.  I was also very dizzy, disoriented, and went to the bathroom but had a hard time aiming. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)


It's one of those things to be wary of in combo with stimulants.  I also should mention that was the highest dose of it I've ever taken (25mg) and it was in combo, so it might be fine with a lower dose.  I find this one has a steep dose/response curve over 20mg.

When I do get them, they are usually centralized in the thigh region... but it's hard to say sometimes.  At higher doses (35mg+) this tremor sensation can become quite noticeable, but I actually enjoy it.


I have also noticed a similar tremor sensation with other tryptamines I have done, especially the 4-substituted ones.

of course and i don't know but you can generally expect a rectal dose to be substantially more potent.  General rule of thumb (or ass rather) is to go with half to maybe 2/3 of an oral dose

Does anyone with more biochem/medical knowledge than I speculate on whether Iprocetin's ability to cause temporary shakes/spasms is indicative of its ability to induce a permanent state like that?  I like everything else about this one especially the CEV's w/ music around 25mg but after four trials, each with muscle spasms, I hesitate to try it again.

hey


In 2-3 days I'll be getting my hands on a batch of 4-AcO-DIPT. I'm really, really excited and can't wait to try this compound, but I have the following problem:


the person I'm getting it from told me that he isn't sure what form the amine is (freebase, hcl/fumurate salt). Any way I could determine this? I don't have access to any cromatography analysis equipment ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). I was thinking about doing some solubility tests in water, but when I told this to my provider he responded that his 2 solubility tests were not conclusive.. so do you people have any idea of how could I proceed?

The freebase would not be soluble in water.


i dont know how to tell the difference btwn hcl and fum. though.

The hcl will be slightly more potent


i know this doesnt help much...

I think ketamine has the potential to turn any experience into a legendary expereicne if you do enough of it...i'd just get good and high on iprocin, wait until you are in a good state of mind, and then start bumping piles of it slowly, wait to see if it starts getting REALLLY intense faster than you think, synergy can kick your ass, especially if you overdo it on ketamine when already totally smashed on a 5ht psychedelic.  Mind you I've never doen iprocin, just 4-aco-dipt, and still don't really know what it's all about.

It's been about 8 years, but I've had a lot of experience with 4-aco-dipt, and I really liked it, but on high doses I would get like little electrical shock feelings - so I haven't sought it out in a while. Recently, I've tried 4-aco-dmt which I also process kind of unusually rough (ie tremors, GI distress) - this may be total bs cuz I'm not a chemist, but I think I don't respond well to 4-acetoxy-tryptamines.

Who has tried Iprocin and MDMA?  Too lazy to read the entire damn thread again and I don't know what a search engine is.  Dose will be 24mg of iprocin and 100mg of MDMA.  The part I can't decide is when to take what....both at same time, or MDMA 1/2 later?  It has been a good 5 years since I've messed with iprocin and I remember that some of the time it peaks by 45min-1hr...yet another time the peak did not show for a good 2hr.  When mixing MDMA with other psychedelics, I prefer to time the peaks together.

My gut says to take them at the same time... generally for me the 4-sub tryptamines, especially the hydroxy ones, take effect quickly and build to a peak rapidly as well.

woo haa, I got my batch and tested 15 mg and it's (very) soluble in water, so I'm guessing it's a fumarate(based on the supposed main vendor, that sells mostly fumarate salts). I'll try it tonight oral and I have planned 2 combos for the next 7 days (with 2c-e and with ketamine). Woo hoo, can't wait to get off from work. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Had the opportunity to try Iprocin for the first time a few days ago. Dose 35mg of the HCl salt. Very nice chem this one. Strong body energy that felt very pleasant, quite a bit of tremors, also felt quite sexual at times. Everything seemed to be cast in that tryptamine sort of hue, almost fluid, like a watercolour painting. Most of the trip was spent in conversation, deep topics. Upon closing my eyes it almost felt like I could dissappear if I wanted to, definitely potential for obe experience. Lasted around 3 hours start to finish

A comparison of Iprocin(4-HO-DiPT) and 4-AcO-DiPT.


Had my second go at Iprocin last night at 40mg(HCl). Prior to this I did 4-aco-dipt at the same dose 3 weeks earlier. 

Imo there is significant difference in effect between the two tryptamines, even though their molecular structures are quite similar, and 4-aco-dipt is metabolised to 4-ho-dipt when ingested(correct me if Im wrong here).


The onset after oral ingestion is about the same for both of them, but the comeup feels much stronger for Iprocin, than its acetoxylated cousin. The visuals are quite pronounced with Iprocin, everything seems to radiate and glow with energy. 4-aco-dipt has no visual activity at all.

Mental headspace can get quite intense, very fast, with Iprocin. 4-aco-dipt is less intense in this respect and seems more fun and carefree. Music sounds amazing on both. 


The first time I did Iprocin I got some leg tremors, and I noticed this on 4-aco-dipt as well, but as I got better at channeling the strong body energy that comes with it, It was almost non-existant. And on my trip last night I didnt notice any bad body tremors at all, even at 40mg.

There is a sexual feeling present with both, and orgasms can get so strong it almost feels like blacking out for a while. Duration of the trip is about the same for both 2-3h.


It seem my bodychemistry responds better to 4-ho-trypts. I have tried 4-aco-mipt, and I will soon try miprocin to compare, but the same trend seems to apply - I expereinced no visual activity with 4-aco-mipt. 4-aco-dmt also lacks any significant visual activty at the doses I have tried it at. Sadly I dont have access to pure 4-ho-dmt to make a comparison.


A final note. 5-meo-dmt blends beautifully with Iprocin, added ~15mg insufflated at the peak, and it melted my excistence into the most amazing ++++ obe trip I have ever experienced.![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I took 4-aco-dipt 4 times now (18 mg oral, 25 mg oral, 34 mg oral, 10mg snorted). very mild visuals, even at 34mg oral. auditive hallucinations only at 34mg and those came in waves. puked at 25mg only, because of the body high and the fact that trying to make sex i was overcome by the sensations. weird. very 'electrical', especially when snorted... my tension skyrocketed. I'm not very pleased with this substance, I like 5-meo-dipt much more. mindset wasn't psychedelic to me. Gave some friends some and some of them really enjoyed it, but most of wouldn't try it again because of the body high. couldn't get a hard on. don't see its use. gave the rest of the batch away, maybe someone will have more luck with it.

Alas, I flushed my remaining 400 mg.  Approx 5 trials w/ this one left me moderately impressed but heavily concerned with the tremors that accompany nearly any dose.  I don't know much about medicine or neuroscience but I don't believe that involuntary tremors/muscle spasms are a good thing.  I don't know that they indicate any type of toxicity or damage either.  Perhaps like many drugs, this is simply a side effect that comes with 4-aco-dipt but for me, one that makes further experiments not worthwhile.


On the bright side, this one, as a HCl, stored in two plastic bags/in the dark for +5 years suffered no degredation aside from some dark patches where the compound was in direct contact with the bag.

Psihonaut: I guess different people react different.  Shoulda maybe tried a lower dose for sex if 40 was too overwhelming.  I cant see using this for any psychedelic experience... but I ***LOVE*** the body high... I get horny as a mountain goat, hardness is NOT a problem, and orgasm seems intensified by like 10X.  But maybe that's just me.


|>R()|)!G/-\|_ : How cruel to at least not donate it to a friend who may want to try it but cant afford it, or who could be hurting for money who could maybe sell it to buy food or maybe rent.  What a waste.  I cant understand it when people CLAIM to have just flushed a hundred bucks worth of a chem just because it didnt quite do it for them... give it away if nothing else.  Drug abuse!

I got rid of a compound b/c of perceived health risks. I wouldn't feel comfortable passing those risks on to somebody else, even if they were willing to take the risk themselves.  I see that as irresponsible.  Additionally, the last thing I would want is for someone to resell it.  These chems [should be] strictly for those who know what they are and where to acquire them.

not that i disagree with your decision to flush it prodigal, but there's a chance your friends wouldn't have reacted badly to the chemical.  individual response can vary dramatically with many of the compounds discussed on this board.


but yeah, i probably would have just flushed it as well.

Took the 4-ACO version 20mg and it was pretty interesting... big body wave.. nice "sparkly" visuals kinda slow.. awesome cev. Friends tried too said it was GREAT sex material.


Tried 10mg on another occasion kinda weak. Only CEV but it felt good... Did some K and it got fancier.

Are the tremors associated with 4-HO/AcO-DiPT indicative of likely causing seizures? Or is it a different mechanism causing these tremors? My girlfriend has suffered seizures (coacaine abuse years ago and about 8 months ago when her doctor fucking dropped her benzo dose to unmanageable amounts). I don't think she is necessarily prone to seizures as the 2 times were due to cocaine and benzo withdrawal but I am concerned about the prevalence of tremors.


I'm assuming lower doses don't cause tremors noticeably. Does anyone have an idea at what dose level tremors start to become apparent? I know it's subjecitve but any help is appreciated.


What dose of 4-HO-DiPT would be best to get a good idea for a first timer?

Also what dose of 4-AcO-DiPT would be best to a get a good idea? Both are hydrochloride by the way.


I am assuming 4-AcO-DiPT is not as potent and may require higher doses.


Would it be reasonable to suggest that most people prefer 4-HO-DPT over 4-AcO-DiPT? If you have a preference I'd love to hear why you prefer on over the other.

I've only tried the AcO, thinking about trying the HO soon.  The highest i took 4-AcO-DiPT was 40ish mgs, maybe a little more.  Had some unpleasant stomach cramps for that though.  I had one friend who's a bit of a hard head & really liked this chemical, at really high doses though, liked 70-80mg.  He got alot more out of it in the way of visuals than i did, even at lower doses.  I found the headspace interesting but a bit uninspiring.  Only bought it once, and hadn't really considered getting it again, just alot more interesting things out there that i'd rather spend the time & money on.

**My 4-aco-dipt experiences**


I have found myself quite tolerant to 4-aco-dipt, at least so far.  This may be related to tolerance from consuming other drugs, primarily 5-meo-mipt.


One time I took 30 mg of 4-aco-dipt, followed by another 30mg some time later, followed by a further 30mg.  I had taken some 5-meo-mipt before that, but I didn't care for that substance, and I assume I was mostly down from it.  I felt like taking another 30mg some time later, but I decided against it.  I was already pretty high and I was having a great time.  It was a wonderful experience, but I didn't find it paritcularly psychedelic, more like MDMA in parts.


Another time I took 40mg, which I didn't get much from.  The following time I took 50mg, which I definitely got something from.  It lasted quite a while, and I experienced some strange perceptual effects after what I thought was the peak had ended.  The perceptual effects were akin to high dose mushrooms, yet slightly different, AND there was a lucidity and a general normality to it, as I still wasn't getting much visually.  It was quite disconcerting.


While I found this stuff relatively uninteresting at what is considered to the typical dose range, it has some interesting effects at higher doses that can be explored.  I will try it on its own, maybe at 45mg, after my tolerance has completely gone away, and report back.


Cheers!

I took a huge dose of 5-meo-mipt (~25MG) may have been somewhere like 27 because I tend to fail at weighing out an accurate amount on this "scale." Anyway, be careful, these things can make you know fear, unlike anything else I've ever used. My reasoning behind dosing high on the 5-meo-mipt was based on experiences that I had read about and because I wanted to experience something very intense. Well I got more than I bargained for with this one, and the effects seemed to be potentiated by a huge ass bong rip that I took which left me feeling very overwhelmed. So overwhelmed that I needed to cut off all of the lights in my house and the TV and just lie in bed. I had uncontrollable closed and open eye visuals and felt as though I might be on the brink of a seizure or something but I think the body load can account for those feelings.


At any rate, I felt comfortable enough and perhaps I may have had a bit of tolerance having previously drank ahyuasca a day before, and taken 7mg of 5-meo-mipt and 20mg of 4-aco-dipt that morning-- I think there's a lot of play room for dosages, the intensity may be too overwhelming however.


4-aco-dipt makes me feel strange, in a stupid way. Like I didn't get any visual effects I got stupid effects from it. What gives?

^ I always considered 4-aco-dipt to be what I have coined a "body hallucinogen"... in that it is GREAT for the highly sexually-charged libido energy it seems to generate, almost like your **body** (and not your mind or visual sense) is fantasizing about "what if touch and sex felt as good as they might in my wildest most exaggerated peak-sex-experience fantasies?"


As a psychedelic or hallucinogen, you are right.... it doesnt seem to do any of that really.  But for a luscious body buzz and/or sexuality, it's pretty great, IMO.  But ONLY for that.

It's definitely psychedelic, I just don't get much in the way of visual effects with it.  It definitely has its own feel.  And like I said, at high doses it gets strangely psychedelic.  I do agree with most of what you've said.  What's curious is how its compared to mushrooms and 2c-b and how people seem to report more classically psychedelic effects.

Was very dissapointed with this compound (the acetoxy variant). Felt almost nothing apart from a very mild (and slightly annoying) body buzz. There were no visuals present at all. This was with a total dose of 45mg. 25mg and then another 20mg an hour later. I know for a fact that the material is in fact very pure 4-acetoxy-DiPT.

Iprocin is probably my fav. 4-sub atm, followed closely by miprocin. I find this compound to be very deep and spiritual, much more so than 4-aco-dmt, which I find to be bland, and lacking in any real intensity. It also provides a very euphoric bodyhigh and is highly erotic/sexual. It goes great with 5-meo-dmt as well. This combo put me near ++++ territory.

Because 4-HO-DiPT is Iprocin I would imagine.

I find this compound to be very deep and spiritual, much more so than 4-aco-dmt, which I find to be bland, and lacking in any real intensity. It also provides a very euphoric bodyhigh and is highly erotic/sexual. It goes great with 5-meo-dmt as well. This combo put me near ++++ territory.

And yes Iprocin is one of my favorites as well though I do enjoy Miprocin and Metocin. This is exactly how I feel about this particular compound.

Hm.. I wonder how this stuff would combine with a dissociative? K would probably be ideal, but I dont have any of that. Might try it with 4-meo-pcp sometime.

Well seeing as how 4-xx-dipt seems to cause muscle tremors, as does DPT, and ketamine is AWESOME with DPT due to calming the muscle tremors, I would say that a solid dose of 4-xx-dipt + some bumps of ketamine definitely has a chance of mixing together well.  I have yet to discover a tryptamine that doesn't mix well with a bit of ketamine.

Can you say what dosage range you've experienced the mild psychedelia and dysphoria at? I find magic mushrooms dysphoric at relatively low doses, for example; but not at higher doses.

I tried 15 and 25mg of 4-aco-dipt. Mushrooms are a little dysphoric for me too but definitely improve my mood over the coming days or even weeks. After the 25mg dose on this I felt pretty low for the next few days at least. Doesn't mean that the drug cause the drop in mood but it definitely didn't help unlike most tryptamines.

I still think 4-aco-dipt is super cool, and unlike most other drugs I've done.  I really like the body high and the "mild psychedelia".  Doing a big dose can result in some pretty intense sensations.  I will have to find another sample of this and report on it some more, it's definitely a unique chemical worthy of exploration.


i'd like to try it in combination with 2c-d sometime.  I think there might be some potential there.

Got some 4-ho-dipt coming and I'm figuring out where and when I want to try it, so I was wondering how in particular the setting affects the trip - DMT I've found to be best in very bright conditions, preferably outdoors, while others are best in a darkened room.  How have settings affected your trips, positively and negatively?  Also, is there increased appreciation for music or food or anything like that?  I don't have a lot of time to trip so I'm trying to set up an ideal experience.

4-ho-dipt hits really fast and hard, faster than almost anything else.  Dont expect much psychedelia.... its primarily an intense highly sensual body buzz.  Do it with a partner who is ready to play, or if on your own have a porn video ready because you are going to need to work off the huge energy rush that it gives you.  Thats the best use for it IMO.

It seems some folk find this compound to be mild. I find Iprocin to be spectacularly psychedelic. It really is delicious. If you can you definitely want to be outside in nature to enjoy trees, sunset, animals, stars and stuff. I have always had very visual experiences with Iprocin, very twinkley and soaked in feminine sensory rushes all round. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

ive had 1 +++ experience with Iprocin.

And while it was very sensual it was also mildy psychedelic.


I do remember thinking at the time that it was much more deserving of the name foxy than 5 meo dipt.

^ heh, yet I thought that too after later trying "Foxy," which is pretty lame in comparison so far as sexual stimulation goes.  And yea, I guess Iprocin could be psychedelic if you focused it that way... it seems very malleable and controllable and that you can channel it in different directions with a little concentration... me of course, being somewhat of a male nympho personality type, tend to have only ONE thing on my mind once everything starts to tingle.  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Anyone else experience restless legs with this compound? I do and it very much reminds me of opiate withdrawal syndrome and anything that reminds me of that is always unpleasant. It puts a damper on the experience with this compound. Something that doesn't happen with other trypt's that I have tried including, DMT, 4-ho-DMT, 4-aco-Mipt, bufotenine, 5-meo-dmt and some others.


Also I'm curious....I've read somewhere that, as with DIPT, 4-ho-dipt causes pitch bending but I have yet to experience this phenomenon on 4-ho-DIPT from doses as low as 18mg up to 35mg. 

I have yet to try Dipt but I hope to soon as I'm very interested in this pitch bending effect. 

Of course I've experienced aural phenomenon from other psyche's, especially vaporized DMT, but from what I've read it's a much more specific effect that is supposed to come from DIPT/4-ho-Dipt,

hmm, just had a relatively nice but very mild experience at ~15mg (could be a bit less i suppose, but over 12mg for sure). relaxing is the word 


either i need to up the dose or perhaps my chem has suffered in storage or is a strange batch, but i think this requires a bit more to get full effects, even though i am after 2 weeks of staying away from anything, and i didnt have a tolerance prior.


i did get very mild shivers, very much like the ones you get in cold air, but not unpleasant at all. not much euphoria either, nor oev, just mild cev...  what made the experince interesting and relaxing is that i was able to enjoy the quiet night outside, and for me at least proved a rather sedate experience


certainly not enough to put this chem in my top 5. not dismissing it completly either, just marking that for me a bigger dose is needed next time

Once again, dont expect significant psychedelic effects from this.  Its only TRUE use is as a sexual stimulant extraordinaire.  Those restless legs and shivers are the result of a deep inner muscular hyper-excitation unique to this chem (and the HO version) that causes orgasms and sensations leading up to them to become UTTERLY MIND BLOWING.


Yes, 15mg is very low.  Try more like 35-45mg, and be sure to have a partner willing to help with your VERY URGENT "needs", or some porn at the ready.

not so sure of that. if anything i feel that the tension i get from the -ho is rather similar to the one i feel on PEAs, most notably 2c-d, a smooth tension that is equal across the body, and which i find unpleasant after a while.


i might give this more tries at higher levels, but honestly think this would just be more useful added to other trips.

the short duration and fast onset seem to make it a candidate for 5-meo-dalt  combination. anyone have experience with combos? (beside K which is already discussed ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

This stuff seems pretty sensitive to dose - I tried about 16 mg orally my first time, just to ease myself into it, and got absolutely nothing out of it.  The only thing I felt was a rush of euphoria for about 2 seconds and I thought "oh shit here goes!" and then it fizzled and nothing else happened.  My second time I tried 22 mg orally from the same batch, and it was fucking STRONG.  I was alone so I basically chilled on my computer and listened to music and watched a movie and I was on the verge of not being able to grasp what was going on around me.  Not very psychedelic, no visuals of any kind, but I was really, really stoned, with a great body high.  My thought processes were pretty weirded out too, and it seemed to heighten my normal emotions; funny things were REALLY FUNNY, sad things were REALLY SAD, etc.  Oddly enough I had lower back pain prior to the trip, as I often do (muscular) and it went away afterwards.  Maybe the muscle tremors loosened me up?  Not much of a hangover to speak of, except emotional I guess, as toward the end of the trip I went through some serious self-examination.  I was fine at work the next morning.


I have a hard time imagining I could do anything on a higher dose, much less something that requires as much coordination as sex with a partner - but then maybe the instincts would just take over.  In any case, 4-HO-DiPT definitely seems worthwhile and I'll try pushing the dose a little next time.

^ yes, the instincts just take over.  With a partner might be a bit chaotic you are right, so its best best use is probably for oneric activities.  Without a focus you just feel sort of plastered all over.  But with a focused and energetic activity, the material seems very malleable and its effects I FIND anyway form themselves along with the activity.  If you just sit there waiting for "stuff to happen" yea it is probably just kind of bleh.  This is one you MUST CONSCIOUSLY *DO* SOMETHING WITH. 


And yes it does combine nicely with other things.  Ive added it to Methylone after that has stabilized at its peak with great highly euphoric effects and no notable body issues... is intense though so be forewarned to expect, um, alotta G's (g-forces, gravity, acceleration, etc)

Very interesting, thanks for the pointers...yeah, I very much got the feeling that some more planning would have improved my trip.  4-HO-DiPT reminds me in this way a lot of 5-MeO-DALT, except with a more intense "stoned" feeling, a more pronounced body high, and less psychedelia.

I've taken 4-aco-dipt three times, at fairly low doses (15-18 mg) and I've really enjoyed it.  The visuals aren't dramatic, but they are psychedelic, and they are there.  I enjoy the low level psychedelic experience, the head-space.  Fully functional in the real world, but...everything is different.  The world appears candy-colored in gorgeous pastels.  My mind making interesting and intuitive connections.  This is a great substance to take if you are out on a sunny day with friends.

recently had the pleasure of trying this again, at a low dose again, and this time it felt a lot better... ~18mg oral were consumed on an empty, and the total experience lasted ~3h. the experience was quite nice overall, nothing too extreme, getting some nice body vibes with it, and indeed, i could feel this chemical might be a good aphrodisiac. 


it also seems to deliver quite an uncomplicated trip at these doses at least. there was no negative body load at all, and there were no psychedelic insights, but my mood was way lifted, my senses were accute, and my music sounded awesome.


speaking of music, ive noticed that it sounded somewhat .. different. like it was really loud but in a way that didnt seem to damage, the bass was waaay low, more tha i remembered for those tracks at least. maybe i was imagining it though, who knows. anyone else got this? usually when tripping i love the music because of the details, but here it seeme lower frequencies were just more detailed tham midtones for instance... placebo?

Without a focus you just feel sort of plastered all over.  But with a focused and energetic activity, the material seems very malleable and its effects I FIND anyway form themselves along with the activity.  If you just sit there waiting for "stuff to happen" yea it is probably just kind of bleh.  This is one you MUST CONSCIOUSLY *DO* SOMETHING WITH.

Mr Hoover,

I must say I've been following you on several threads and like your posts, both style and substance!

As a fellow onanist, and general sex-fiend, I've grown a bit out of weed and the synth-analogs I'm forced to use due to my job possibly testing, these were recently banned in my state in anycase. But since i have a stash of synthetic weed left over from the brief legal days, I was wondering if you'd tried iprocetyl with weed yourself at any point? I'd imagine things could get delightfully filthy with or without a fuckbuddy. Thoughts? 

PS I have no idea what is actually in my synthetics JWH?? but no adverse effects when used in tiny amounts (100mg or less per toke) and a very authentic THC like aphrodisiac effect.

**4-aco-DiPT it's almost 'game on' time...**


After more research online, I'm going to get some 4-aco-DiPT. (I can't find the 4-HO-DiPT DwayneHoover refers to here 

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/554553-The-Small-amp-So-Far-Insignificant-4-AcO-DiPT-Thread/page2](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/554553-The-Small-amp-So-Far-Insignificant-4-AcO-DiPT-Thread/page2) ) but the 4-aco sounds smoother for a noob like me.


Erowid notes no legal issues pertaining to 4-aco_DiPT anywhere other than Japan and Sweden, but since UK sites don't offer it among their ever-shrinking menus and generally 'iffy' concoctions I can only presume Erowids' page for the 'legality' of 4-aco-DiPT in the UK is well out of date?


As for aMT, it seems to have as many train-wrecks as glowing reports, so much so that I'm not even gonna bother - don't need me or my GF spinning out/puking on something as notoriously fickle and capricious as aMT. I've been planning this sex-marathon for weeks! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

had the pleasure of mixing this chemical (4-ho-dipt) on the way down from a aMT trip. the amt dose was ~15mg, and after 5h i added ~15mg 4-ho-dipt.

what an awesome sensation. last time, i dosed a bit higer on its own, but the combination was pure body pleasures. the erotic was greatly enhanced, almost unbearably so, i was feeling tingles all over, for about 2h. there was no sign of any visual effects, but the music sounded out of this world.

i felt the effects of the 4-ho-dipt come on then gently fade away at the 2:30h mark. i had the most incredible (though self caused eh![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) orgasm ever, i could barely walk afterwards as i was still trembling from the intensity... the next 2 hours i was listening to music completely immersed in the beauty of the notes.... such a worthwhile chemical... 


no sign of nausea, only a bit of trembling in the extremities, but nothing worrisome. no CEVs or OEVs, which i know might not be to the likes of some. also, i wasnt able to notice any change in musical perception, as all the music i listened to was new so i had no means of comparison.

^Yes indeed both the 4-ho and the 4-aco DIPTs are just so deliciously erotic... "almost unbearably so" as you very aptly put it.  Thanks for the report that the combo went well... they do seem to work well on the tail end of stimulants... I have added 4-aco-dipt to Methylone as its peak begins to wane to similarly shuddering effect.  Glad to hear you enjoyed yourself so thoroughly!

So, yesterday i decided to give this one a go after being really happy with what i experienced with 4-HO-DPT a week ago, so i dosed approx. 12mgs nasally to see how things are going, followed by another 15mgs approx. 1- max. 1 1/2hrs later.


Man, this stuff is really strong! ~25mgs up the nose were pretty intense, my sensory input was dramatically enhanced to a point being almost too much for me tbh, everything i heard was pitch-bending (even more so than on comparatively 4-HO-DPT) and my vision became a wobbling mess with CEVs/OEVs like i haven't experienced them before.


Pupils were hugely dilated (just took a look @ the beginning of the experience) and i felt some annoying leg tremors/shivering along with some nausea, that persisted at least 1/3 of the whole experience and got better during the final parts of it, changing into an incredibly erotic body buzz. 


It literally really felt like being witness of having a wet dream at night and feeling the build-up of an head-orgasm just by being totally immersed in an almost dissociative headspace, that resembled MXE a lot in some ways.


Music was insane on this one!


All in all it was a bit too high dosed i think (at least for the 1st time) but really impressive, unfortunately i wasn't prepared for that much.


The whole experienced lasted a good 3-3 1/2hrs which felt like a lot more, with aftereffects of another 1-2hrs.


What i took was the HCl by the way.

^Sounds like a great experience ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have trouble remembering my iprocin experiences in full. I'm not sure if that's because I used to be a benzo head, or whether it's the nature of the drug. What I do remember of them though is pretty much like you described - a wobbly visual field with sparkly visuals, and a near-dissociative headspace with a very pleasurable body high.


I don't remember any CEVs, but again that could be because I used to take benzos or I just wasn't closing my eyes.

Hm, it was a mixed bag tbh. Btw i forgot to throw in i vaped some weed during the come-up, approx. 25mins after the second dose. Dunno if it was the weed that made it stronger, but shortly after vaping i laid down and from then on the effects were building up to an extent i didn't really thought to get with this substance. I thought it would be softer, but to make it short, i was really blasted!


Perhaps it was just because i laid down with music on in a semi-dark room, which made more of a space to feel the obivously increasing effects or if it really was the weed, which worked as some sort of catalyst.


The dissociation was also intense at times and i sometimes really thought i'd falling into a hole, at least that's what it felt like, but who knows for sure, i also listened to the same music as with my last, utterly insane MXE-trip, so that could've played a role too.


Thing is i like psychedelics but i hate it to be overwhelmed to such an extent, i was simply overran by a compound i thought of being not that potent. After the first dose i didn't felt too spaced out and i retrospectively should've taken no more than another 10mgs, i think this would've been sufficient even though on the other hand it could've been even stronger, but i just wasn't expecting that much at that specific moment...


I'm prepared for the next time, but not that soon tbh BUT...


...since both, 4-HO-DiPT and 25I-NBOMe seem to work on the 5-HT2A-Receptor, would it be of success/or possible to consume some 25I today?


And in addition to that, is there any known cross-tolerance between compounds like 4-HO-DPT/4-ACO-DMT/DPT/4-HO-MiPT or 25I-NBOMe with 4-HO-DiPT? 


I don't think of combining some of them, it's just a tolerance related question, because i'm planning on doing another trip today. I really feel the need to get my positiveness back from the void, where i lost some of it yesterday ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

All of them cause cross-tolerance. With most psychedelics, one should wait at least four days before conducting a subsequent trial. After an NBOMe compound, one should wait at least one week.

^That is true, but NBOMes have a very high affinity and efficacy for the 5-ht2a receptor, and so it might cut through the tolerance from a tryptamine trip the night before. I guess the only way to find out is to try it, but expect the intensity to be reduced. Please don't take that to mean you should dose higher on the NBOMe though. Try a normal dose and see where it gets you.

That's amazing that it got so intense you were almost falling in to a hole. That's pretty much unheard of for a tryptamine, but these diisopropyl analogues are some strange beasts. Weed will definitely magnify a tryptamine high exponentially as well, so that could definitely have been the factor which tipped it over the edge for you.

It's not just that, besides the feeling of falling into a hole, i experienced an unimaginable amount of erotic body vibes, like all the agitation and tension inside of me, which was very annoying and persisted for most of the duration of effects, turned into some strange sort of orgasmic head high like i've never experienced it before. It's like i said above, experiencing some wet dream erotica whilst fully awake. After that climax, my body felt really relaxed and my mind calm.


Biggest downside on this was the tension deep inside of me and some tremors, which wouldn't let me find a comfortable position.


Btw thanks for sharing your thoughts about doin' 25I tonight. I now decided to dive into the void using DPT today, so stay tuned @ the specific thread ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^ DPT definitely will have a cross tolerance with your Iprocin.  i once wasted a bunch of my DPT not realizing i had a cross tolerance at the time.  DPT is expensive, i say put it off until you know you don't have a tolerance.

all the psychedelics you mention will have some cross tolerance. might be a better idea to just wait it out and enjoy tripping some other time...


interesting and happy to ehar im not the only one getting the erotic vibe on this one. was getting worried there for a while that its only me with the dirty mind ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Too late @ thenightwatch, it really seems like i wasted some but given the small amount i ingested (25mgs), it's not too bad. These 25mgs via plugged ROA gave me a really heavy stoned/tired feeling which needed some time to built up, and i initially really thought i'd wasted the material, but in the end it felt really good - giant pupils and my body felt like wrapped in cotton. After being not happy with these effects i added approx. 70mgs MXE and then rode the unicorn over the rainbow back and forth... Oh my, what a night ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Last night i came to the conclusion that psychedelics give me a sometimes very wonky mentally feeling, so my feelings/emotions seem to go overboard at some points, and it's really unsteady in terms of mental effects and well-being, while dissociatives on the other hand are even more of a hellish ride while also being mentally more stable, at least for me.


I feel fookin' fine today and things seem back in it's place, if that makes sense?!


Next time i'll try the DPT on it's own, but for now i'm stuffed ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^^ i haven't actually had a chance to try Iprocin yet.  would you say 4-ho-dipt is more sexual than DPT?  cause DPT was soooo sexual for me haha.

I haven't found 4-HO-DiPT sexual at all in the beginning, i read about this but it didn't felt erotic actually. I had an somewhat uncomfortable body buzz and was shivering a bit, which reminded me of shrooms sometimes, where i constantly change my position to get a fitting position (not everytime but often). But later into the experience, this turned (or it was the whole time, i dunno, it just felt weird before) into a really erotic body-buzz, i.e. i was horny as fuck! It's like all this energy that's streaming trough my body, found it's centre in my hips, where it concentrated and turned into some really sexual vibrant energy. That may sounds strange but it's exactly how it felt.


Needless to say i "released" that energy and the climax was beyond what i could've been dreamt of. This is btw the first time ever i had the urge to do so, except with MXE one time, where it was also enjoyable to an almost extreme extent.


DPT on the other hand didn't felt sexual at all, but wait...now if you say it, approx. half an hour after consuming the 25mgs, i had this feeling again and i thought it was because of the 4-HO-DiPT i consumed 24hrs before...perhaps it was the DPT then, but the feeling was way weaker than the night before.

^Once you've awakened that powerful sexual energy, you can tap in to it easily again on other psychedelics. I find psychs to easily allow the unblocking of habitual energy blockages, and that is why they can cause a massive surge of sexual energy throughout your entire organism which can be enormously healing and rejuvenating. You kind of get used to knowing where your energy blockages are, and just allowing them to be released.


Exploring your sexuality on psychedelics is a whole area of exploration in itself.

What makes you say 4-HO-MET puts a hard strain on the heart? I found all 4-HO tryptamines to be relatively easy on the body...


Maybe sensations like that were part of your subjective experience...


I really want to take 4-HO-DiPT again, but have run out... both the mental trip and the body trip have been easygoing and smooth for me before, also I think it combines wonderfully with K. If I have the money I will order some.

Yeah I've never experienced anything I would consider "hard" on any part of my body from 4-HO-MET.  In fact "soft" is one word I'd use to describe all aspects of the experience.

My 4-HO-DiPT HCl that I got a few years ago and have kept in a cold and dark place for the majority of the time since then is still as purely white as it was the day I got it, for whatever that's worth.

I recently ordered some 4-ho-dipt and sent it away for testing via FTIR. The result I got was 50% 4-ho-dipt, 50% some other tryptamine. They cluld not identify it. The other 4 sub I purchased tested as expected.


I asked for a 1H-NMR which they provided. Would anyone here be able to interpert it for me? I am not sure what to do with this 4-ho-dipt now, perhaps the FTIR testing is not reliable?

Wow!! A blast from the past!!


4-ho-dipt was the first "research chemical" I tried way back in 2003. I only got to experience it once, but that experience was AMAZING. One of my most memorable tryptamine experiences. It also led to me trying SO many new drugs in the last 18+ years.


[@islander20](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/138476/) I would probably consume it. Perhaps cautiously at first. I'm sort of adventurous about things like that though.


If there was no reference standard for 50% of the sample then you may be one of the first to try a new tryptamine in combo with 4-ho-dipt. ![😆](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png)


If you try it let us know. If you decide you don't want to chance it let me know ![😉](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


There definitely are people here who can help interpret your NMR. I suggest you make a thread about it and post it to the thread.

Maybe I'm too cautious but I think this is a bad idea. It seems strange that the lab wasn't able to identify the other tryptamine. That's a red flag, no?

That doesn't seem to match my NMR but I am way out of my element. It was from a Canadian vendor but not that one. The FTIR testing site had another sample of 4-ho-dipt that tested the same as mine. Maybe a synthesis byproduct?

I somehow doubt that there's more than one batch going around at the moment (though I could be totally wrong about that)... Which makes me wonder if the NMR posted by the vendor is legit...

I'm mystified by this one.


##### 4-HO-DiPT - 4th Time (20mg orally) - Dull Dosage Mystery

4-HO-DiPT  -  4th Time  -  20mg orally  Background: I've taken several dozen psychedelics over a hundred times over the course of my life.  Setting: At home, well-fed and rested. I'd eaten a meal two hours earlier. Anticipating erotic endeavors, my friend and I took 3mg of tadalafil at ~1pm. I...

In terms of experience intensity, this is how it has gone for me so far:

6mg>10mg>15mg>20mg


Even stranger, my friend took 20mg of 4-HO-MiPT at the same time and had the same experience. They are intimately familiar with that material and have never had the same weak, delayed onset thing happen. 


This makes zero sense.

4-HO-DiPT was a substance I had wanted to try for many years, but I struggled to find it. Once, I was close, but customs seized my order. Recently, however, fortune smiled on me, and I successfully acquired it, adding it to the list of tryptamines I've tried.


I decided to start with 15 mg taken orally.


Noticeable effects indistinguishable from placebo appeared only after an hour, which surprised me. Shulgin wrote that 4-HO-DiPT stands out for its fast onset. My experiences with other tryptamines usually began 20–40 minutes after ingestion, but here, I had to wait a full hour. Before the effects appeared, I was already accepting the idea that I wouldn’t feel anything. Fortunately, I was wrong.


The most noticeable thing at first was that I felt cold - something I typically experience with tryptamines, especially since I was lying still in bed. I knew then that something was starting to happen. This was accompanied by trembling throughout my body, especially in my legs. Surprisingly, I found these full-body tremors pleasant. My body was filled with enjoyable, almost euphoric sensations.


My thinking and reasoning was pretty sober. This was noticeably different compared to tryptamines like shrooms or 4-HO-MiPT. At 15 mg, the mental effects were quite weak. I also didn’t notice any CEVs. OEVs were present - shroom-like, weak, subtle but noticeable. They grew more intense over time but never reached a level that would overwhelm me.


The euphoria I felt in my body but not in my mind was the main effect during this experience. Music sounded good but not so good as to draw my attention in any special way.


I decided to go outside and take a walk around the city. While walking, I felt as though I was gliding and observing everything around me. I looked around and could closely examine everything. The trees were beautiful, and it was easy to notice the patterns formed by their branches.


As I was walking, I felt a light dissociation, probably because my usual perception of daily walks suddenly felt entirely different. I paid attention to details - everything was interesting. I passed a man with an unusual way of walking, or at least that's how it seemed to me - I noticed it more than I would have if I were sober. It looked grotesque, strange, different. Everything seemed like a parody of reality.


I ended up in a busy part of the city and began hearing sounds beyond my headphones. I took them off and heard a terrible cacophony from which I couldn't make out any specific sounds. I couldn't tell if I was hearing music from a nearby bar or conversations of people behind me. I just heard a formless noise. It was probably overlapping conversations mixed with distant music, but I perceived it as something interconnected. It was clear that my perception of sound was altered, but I didn't experience pitch lowering like with N,N-DiPT or 5-MeO-DiPT. Instead, there were changes in how I mentally processed surrounding sounds. The street noise stressed me out.


I entered a shopping mall, mainly because I wanted to see how 4-HO-DiPT would manifest in such an environment. I took off my headphones again and experienced the same thing - total noise, from which nothing could be identified. I heard only a brutal chaos that seemed to pierce my brain.


I entered a grocery store inside the mall but wasn't planning on making any major purchases because my social anxiety was kicking in. I wondered if I could handle interacting with the cashier, but I decided I could. Beforehand, I rehearsed my lines in my head several times: "By card, please" I managed, but when I said those words to the cashier, I didn't recognize my own voice, and I thought I might be experiencing pitch lowering like with N,N-DiPT. However, later tests with familiar sounds didn’t confirm this effect. Apparently, it’s something else — definitely altered sound perception, but it seems to be more on the psychological level rather than directly affecting pitch like N,N-DiPT does.


I returned home listening to music on my headphones. It was a pleasant, shroom-like walk but without any deep reflections on the meaning of life.


I took the substance at 5:00 PM, effects appeared at 6:00 PM, and by 8:00 PM, the experience was over, except of some subtle afterglow.


To summarize, what I found characteristic of this experience, compared to other 4-substituted tryptamines, was the bodily euphoria, chills unrelated to perceived temperature, a sober mindspace, mild visuals, pleasant music perception, and altered sound perception, particularly of street noise

I'll start by saying that I'm an enthusiast of psychedelic tryptamines. I've been hunting for 4-HO-DiPT for many years, but it was always out of my reach - until I finally managed to get 50 mg of it.

I decided to take 15 mg first and then 35 mg two weeks later. This is the trip report for the 35 mg dose. My last post in this thread was about the 15 mg experience.


At 15:00, I got in my car and headed toward my favorite forest. It’s a desolate place - nothing but forests and lakes, no people. I often go there for recreation and never run into anyone.

At 15:10, about one-third of the way there, I took 35 mg of 4-HO-DiPT hemifumarate in a capsule.

I arrived at around 15:20, feeling no effects yet - maybe just some mild physiological ones, like increased sweating or chills. I parked my car and started walking deeper into the forest.


At 15:40, the psychedelic effects hit suddenly. Along with them came euphoria and awe at the surrounding nature. I kept walking.

Around 16:00, I experienced a very unpleasant body load, shortly after taking a piss. I started having intrusive visions of myself vomiting all over myself in the middle of the forest path, begging for help, unable to move. These were, of course, just obsessive thoughts, but I began to wonder if that was my near future. Maybe 35 mg was too much for a forest trip? I thought.


I decided to keep going, but the body load wouldn't let up. At one point, I stopped and sat on the grass, feeling faint. I wasn't sure if the situation was serious or not. I threw my backpack to the ground and crouched beside it. It lasted maybe three minutes, then passed. I got up and walked on. The body load vanished in seconds. Euphoria kicked in, and from then on, I oscillated between euphoria and anxiety. The anxiety returned each time the body load resurfaced - it came and went exactly three times.


I’d say the peak was when the body load disappeared for the third time and, from then on, was only occasional, subtle, and non-disruptive.


As I walked through the forest, I experienced typical psychedelic effects on every level - visual, auditory, and mental. But the auditory effects stood out the most, truly exceptional compared to other tryptamines. The first thing I noticed was that certain layers of music had an intense echo while others had much less, making familiar songs sound noticeably different. That was the first effect. Then, as I kept listening, I started losing myself in the music.


The music sounded as good as music possibly can on a psychedelic tryptamine. I felt it flowing through every atom of my body, like I was an instrument being played, resonating with the music I was hearing. It was almost terrifying at times because I felt like I was losing all perception of anything except the sound.


While walking through the forest, I was mesmerized by its beauty. The trees looked like something out of a fairy tale. Staring at one spot for too long caused an explosion of fractals, and whatever I was looking at would slowly dissolve into abstract patterns. To bring reality back into focus, I had to look around and consciously ground myself.


One visual effect that really stuck with me was something that looked like a layer of dish soap stretched between the trees. As if someone was using the trees and bushes to blow massive soap bubbles. I'd never seen anything like it, but then again, I haven’t tripped in the forest that often (though it has happened).


I remember sitting on a fallen tree at the peak and closing my eyes. I saw vivid CEVs, but I didn't have time to explore them fully. What stuck with me was how high-contrast they were—black and white, alternating. It reminded me of shrooms, which gave me identical visuals. It also brought back memories of my DPT trips. The body load had similarities to DPT as well, but it wasn't as brutal. Still, there were moments where I wasn't sure if I was going to throw up. Luckily, those were short-lived. I'm talking about the three waves of body load I mentioned earlier, at the beginning of my experience. It was short but intense, though never bad enough to turn the whole experience into a disaster, which has happened to me with DPT before.


As it started getting dark, I felt sober enough to head back to the car. But before starting the engine, I walked around the area for another 20 minutes—I didn’t feel ready to drive yet.


In the end, I got in the car at 17:20, about two hours after the first effects hit. I'll admit, it wasn’t the smartest decision. At times, I had to concentrate hard on the road because when I drifted too much, the entire road would flood with fractals. But the road was empty, and I was driving slowly, so I managed. I never want to repeat that, though. Don't do that like I did.


I got home around 17:50, but before going inside, I got myself some groceries. Just like with the 15 mg trip, I felt like my voice sounded different when I spoke. After the 15 mg trip, I thought I imagined it, but now I’m sure something’s going on. It’s not a typical pitch drop like with N,N-DiPT, but my voice does sound deeper when I speak.


Both during the 15 mg and 35 mg trips, I noticed muscle tremors, especially in my legs, seemingly unrelated to temperature. Shulgin wrote about this too, and I can confirm it’s a real effect.

Sounds like you're getting respectable experiences from it. I have had a fair few trips with it, and they just never quite seem to end up anywhere all that interesting for some reason.
