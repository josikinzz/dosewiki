# Dimenhydrinate
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00985*

## Overview

### Description

A medication used to prevent and treat nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and motion sickness.

### Background

Dimehydrinate was first described in the literature in 1949,
5
and patented in 1950.
11
Early research into dimenhydrinate focused on its role as an antihistamine for urticaria; the treatment of motion sickness was an accidental discovery.
7
Dimenhydrinate, also known as B-dimethylaminoethyl benzohydrol ether 8-chlorotheophyllinate, is indicated to prevent nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness.
9
,
10
,
11
Dimenhydrinate is a combination of
Diphenhydramine
and
8-chlorotheophylline
in a salt form, with 53%-55.5% dried diphenhydramine, and 44%-47% died 8-chlorotheophylline.
10
The antiemetic properties of dimenhydrinate are primarily thought to be produced by diphenhydramine's antagonism of H1 histamine receptors in the vestibular system
2
while the excitatory effects are thought to be produced by 8-chlorotheophylline's adenosine receptor blockade.
3
When used in large doses, dimenhydrinate has been shown to cause a "high" characterized by hallucinations, excitement, incoordination, and disorientation.
1
Dimenhydrinate was granted FDA approval on 31 May 1972.
8

### Indication

Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness.
9
,
10

### Pharmacodynamics

Dimenhydrinate is indicated for the prevention and treatment of nausea, vomiting, or vertigo of motion sickness.
9
,
10
It has a short duration of action of 4-8 hours.
4
Patients should be counselled regarding pronounced drowsiness, avoiding alcohol and other sedatives, and exercising caution when operating a motor vehicle or heavy machinery.
9

### Mechanism of Action

Histamine H1 receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

A 50 mg oral film coated tablet reaches a C
max
of 72.6 ng/mL with a T
max
of 2.7 hours.
12
A 100 mg suppository reaches a C
max
of 112.2 ng/mL with a T
max
of 5.3 hours.
13

### Metabolism

Dimenhydrinate is a theoclate salt that separates into
diphenhydramine
and
8-chlorotheophylline
.
10
diphenhydramine can either be N-glucuronidated by UGTs to diphenhydramine N-glucuronide or N-demethylated by CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 to N-desmethyldiphenhydramine.
6
N-desmethyldiphenhydramine can be N-demethylated again by the same enzymes to N,N-didesmethyldiphenhydramine, which undergoes oxidative deamination to form diphenylmethoxyacetic acid.

### Half-life

The plasma elimination half life of dimenhydrinate is 5-8 hours.
12

### Toxicity

Infants and children experiencing an overdose may lead to hallucinations, convulsions, or death.
10
Adults experiencing an overdose may present with drowsiness, convulsions, coma, or respiratory depression.
10
Treat overdoses with symptomatic and supportive measures including mechanically assisted ventilation.
10
In mice the oral LD
50
is 203 mg/kg, while in rats it is 1320 mg/kg.
10
The intraperitoneal LD
50
in mice is 149 mg/kg.

### Mechanism of action

Dimenhydrinate is a theoclate salt that separates into
diphenhydramine
and
8-chlorotheophylline
.
10
,
13
While the exact mechanism of action is unknown, diphenhydramine is theorized to reduce disturbances to equilibrium through antimuscarinic effects or histamine H1 antagonism.
7
8-chlorotheophylline may produce excitation through blocking adenosine receptors, reducing the drowsiness produced by diphenhydramine.

### Volume of distribution

The volume of distribution of dimenhydrinate is 3-4 L/kg.
12

### Protein binding

Dimenhydrinate is 70-85% protein bound in plasma.
12

### Route of elimination

Dimenhydrinate is predominantly eliminated in the urine.
12
1-3% of the dissociated diphenhydramine is eliminated in the urine unchanged, while 64% of diphenhydramine is eliminated in the urine as metabolites.
13
The elimination of dimenhydrinate has not been fully studied.

### General Function

G-protein-coupled receptor for histamine, a biogenic amine that functions as an immune modulator and a neurotransmitter (PubMed:33828102, PubMed:8280179). Through the H1 receptor, histamine mediates the contraction of smooth muscles and increases capillary permeability due to contraction of terminal venules. Also mediates neurotransmission in the central nervous system and thereby regulates circadian rhythms, emotional and locomotor activities as well as cognitive functions (By similarity)
