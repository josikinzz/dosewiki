2C-B (4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine) is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974.

This substance first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. It was considered one of the best drugs for this purpose because of its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature.

Like many 2c-x substances, this drug is a highly dose sensitive psychedelic known for its entactogenic effects, bright visuals, and intense body load. This substance is often described by users as feeling half way between LSD and MDMA. Many reports suggest that while 2C-B’s entactogenic effects are less pronounced than MDMA, the visual effects are described as more pronounced and colourful.

The 2C-B experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-B can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-B is not necessarily one of the most intense, but is instead one of the most complex compared to other psychedelics, sharing components of MDMA, 2C-E, and LSD. This is first characterized by an intense soft warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming extremely physically euphoric. This is most similar to MDMA and is consistently manifested throughout the experience. This is contrasted by an intensely pleasurable yet sharp, cold electric tingling sensation which moves up and down the body. This is most similar to LSD and is also consistently manifested throughout the trip. The final physical effect noticed throughout the experience is an intense and slightly uncomfortable, energetic pins and needles sensation that manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting and tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. This is most similar to 2C-E and is not entirely consistent throughout the trip.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-B is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of 2C-B is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages.

The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Introspection** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA but still prove stronger and more consistent than other psychedelics of any class. This is capable of providing long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Sexual arousal**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-B presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (melting, flowing, breathing and morphing) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance, and unrealistic/ cartoon like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD than that of 2C-E, psilocin, or ayahuasca. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp in their edges and angular in their corners. They seem high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory States*

Like LSD, while 2C-B is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states, this is extremely rare and inconsistent at higher levels but common at lower and generally includes the following effects:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although 2C-B is technically capable producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-B will for most go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, 2C-B is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-B are more common than some psychedelics in their occurrence and are capable of producing a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

There is no current data for the lethal dosage of 2C-B, but it is thought to be extremely high. Alexander Shulgin reported in his book PIHKAL that an accidental dosage of 100mg resulted in no physical or psychological damage.

Since the invention of this substance in 1974, not a single person has yet to accidentally or deliberately experience a fatal overdose with this substance. This suggests that 2C-B is very safe but please keep in mind that clinical studies assessing its safety have not been performed in any scientific context.

In terms of its tolerance, 2C-B can be redosed repeatedly with little to no loss in the strength of its subjective effects. This means that is theoretically possible to become addicted to it but thanks to its psychedelic properties users experience a powerful self-regulating quality to this substance.

**Legal Issues:**

**Conclusion:**

The main bulk of the 2C-B subjective effects breakdown for this particular article was not written by myself but the [PsychonautWiki](http://www.PsychonautWiki.org) admin known as [Cocoanatta](http://encyclopediapsychonautica.org/index.php?title=User:Cocoanatta). I have tried 2C-B on two separate occasions and can confirm that the descriptions are indeed accurate.

As for the substance itself, 2C-B is an incredibly fun and therapeutically beneficial substance. This makes it extremely useful for both recreational and introspective purposes. It is, in my opinion, the most suitable psychedelic for a beginner in existence due to its clear, euphoric headspace and proportionally mild visual effects in comparison to that of LSD or mushrooms.

## Subjective Experience

2C-B was first synthesised by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 and became one of his most
popular creations. It was initially used in psychiatric therapy, before emerging as a
popular recreational drug.

For a period in the late 1980s it was sold as a legal alternative to MDMA, but
generally it is now perceived more accurately; as a chemical which induces its own
unique experience. At the time of writing it is still widely available, and is sometimes
(dubiously) used as a club drug.

It was, in fact, one of Shulgin's personal favourites, particularly in the context of
sexual activity:

\`\`\`
"If there is anything ever found to be an effective aphrodisiac, it will
probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure." ~ Alexander Shulgin
\`\`\`
With respect to this, it is interesting to note that it was once sold commercially as an
aphrodisiac, under the names Erox and Nexus.

Research (including with reference to Shulgin’s PiHKAL) also indicates that this
chemical is extremely dose sensitive, with a very steep curve: meaning that only
slight changes in dose can result in significantly different experience outcomes.

After due diligence consideration, and with this in mind, I decide to dose at
15mg, which is pitched well above threshold but is reasonably low on the overall
scale.

As a backdrop, the particular pill I am sampling was recently the subject of a number
of hysterical and misleading UK media reports. It is bright yellow in colour and was
allegedly manufactured in the Netherlands.

\`\`\`
T+0.00 I crumble the pill (18mg) and put 3mg to one side, swallowing the rest
with fizzy water. Note that I am testing on an empty stomach. [3pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0.40 The headspace is starting to develop. A chilly feeling emerges, and I
note that I have cold fingers (indicating vasoconstriction).
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel a little shivery, apart from my head, which is strangely warm.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.00 The ride seems to have settled. The headspace is now stable and the
earlier body sensations linger lightly but gently in the background.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1.15 At this point I am still fully functional and can easily suppress the
experience, which comprises a mild psychedelic ambiance with no obvious
visuals, other than brighter colouration should I focus upon this aspect.
Layered on top of this there is a physical awareness which is slowly levelling.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 There is no significant change. I am in a solid ++ state, but one which
is not unduly exciting.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 As this is clearly not going to escalate much further, if at all, I pop the
remaining 3mg from the original pill. The total dose is now 18mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I test taste, via a bag of plain crisps. There is no particular change or
enhancement, and no noticeable loss or increase in appetite.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Now, what about sex and horn, as so frequently referred to?
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
There is certainly interest, but it is not overwhelming by any means.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I do feel that sexual human contact would be enhanced as there is a tactile
edge to this, but there is no strong or compulsive drive or urge (as per certain
stimulants). It is quite subtle in nature, and I suspect that suitable
circumstances and intimacy would make all the difference.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:30 I feel content and happy enough, although I am not tripping high or
particularly intensively. The shivers and chills have largely dissipated and
there is no perceptible discomfort in terms of body load. My skin does feel
relatively sensitised, in a strange entactogenic sort of way.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My mind tends to wander and drift, again though it is well under normal
functional control if I focus. I feel a little dreamy.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Despite eating so little today, after the crisps and some yoghurt I don't feel at
all hungry. Note that I have been drinking plenty of fluid, but for safety
reasons rather than thirst.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Regarding visuals, along with slightly enhanced colouration there is a degree
of morphing in play, albeit light and transient. This isn’t a central feature.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:10 At this point I believe that I am drifting back down towards baseline,
which defies most of the published material.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I feel a sense of calmness and serenity: a comfortable and positive mood.
There remains a certain sentience which is not quite tingly, but is perhaps a
prelude status to this condition.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 The effects documented earlier are still present, but are much less
pronounced. I am closing in on normality.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 To all intents and purposes, I am back to base, with only the usual sort
of post-trip afterglow persisting.
\`\`\`
Following this pleasant but unspectacular experience, I tired a little earlier than
usual and retired to bed early. I slept well and woke up with no hangover at all.

Overall, this was a good ++ experience. I can see how some people confuse it with
MDMA, but I found it to be less empathogenic and I was much more body conscious.
I found it to be similar to, but less intense than, a 10-12mg dose of 2C-B-FLY (noting
that I hadn’t tested any of the other 2C compounds at this point).

Given my size and experience 15mg was probably a good introductory dose, but if
further testing is possible, I will probably increase this to the 20mg range. Generally,
however, as some users do report body load issues, caution is advisable.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[2C-B Images](https://erowid.org/2cb_images.shtml)
 
2C-B is a synthetic psychedelic that first gained popularity as a legal ecstasy replacement in the mid 1980s. It is generally considered to be somewhat 'gentler' than LSD or mushrooms, being less prone to catalyzing dissociated freak-outs or overwhelming panic attacks at normal recreational doses. 2C-B is also known for the strong body component of its effects which are alternately described as pleasurable energy or a 'sense of being in the body', and by others as an unpleasant 'buzzing' or body-load. 
 
 2C-B is still sometimes sold as "ecstasy", although this is rare because it is actively sought by many users for its unique effects. 2C-B is sometimes chosen for use in psychedelic psychotherapy because its short duration and less 'pushy' character. 
 
[ [Main 2C-B Vault](https://erowid.org/2cb.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/2cb_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 2C-B is between 10 and 40 mg. It is most frequently found in either powder or (small) pill form. Pills have commonly contained 5 mg, though this varies. 2C-B is also sometimes snorted for a shorter experience with quicker onset. Snorted doses are about 1/3 that of an oral dose and are legendarily painful. Underground market 2C-B has historically been of high quality because it has generally been sold to a relatively exclusive market of knowledgeable buyers.
 
Price #
 
2C-B is often sold at ecstasy prices at clubs & parties, from 10-30\$ per 'dose' (usually 15-25 mg). Purchased in large quantities it sells for 200-500\$ per gram at retail levels or 100-300\$ per gram at wholesale prices. (August 2000)
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/2cb_law.shtml) #
 
2C-B is illegal to possess and sell in the United States (schedule I) and in most other countries. 2C-B was scheduled in the U.S. in 1993 and in most other countries between 1994 and 1998.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/2cb_chemistry.shtml) #
 
4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B) is a synthetic chemical in the phenethylamine class. It is related structurally to mescaline, DOB, and distantly to MDMA.

[History](https://erowid.org/2cb_timeline.php) #
 
2C-B was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 while exploring homologues of DOB. Its psychoactivity was first discovered on June 25, 1975 by Dr. Shulgin who described it as "beautifully active". 2C-B was marketed in the late 1980s as an MDMA replacement after MDMA was scheduled in 1985. It was added to schedule I in the U.S. in 1994 and by 1999, it was illegal in most of the world.

2C-B; Nexus; Bees.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping; To See Bees.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/2cb_effects.shtml) #
 
In the beginning stages of onset, 2C-B is likely to cause a sort of indefinable feeling similar to anticipation or anxiety. There may be a feeling of energy in the body, and the sense that things are different than usual. As the effects intensify, a wide variety of perceptual changes may occur; pupil dilation, visual patterning and movement, mental stimulation, new perspectives, feelings of insight, emotional shifts (mood lift or introspection), anxiety and confusion. Many people find that the effects of 2C-B are more subtle or manageable than those of other psychedelics, allowing the user to more easily approach baseline thinking during the experience. Unlike some other psychoactives, many people find themselves able to eat shortly after peak effects subside. Closed-eye visuals are quite common with 2C-B. Open-eye visual patterning, color-shifts, and wavering or moving vision are common for many people and are more likely at higher doses
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently one has eaten food, oral 2C-B generally takes 45-75 minutes to take effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 2C-B last approximately 4-6 hours when taken orally. For many people there is an additional period of time (2-4 hrs) where it is difficult to go to sleep but where mood and mind-set are mostly back to baseline. The day-after effects of 2C-B are relatively mild, with most users reporting little to no lingering negative effects.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Many users do not enjoy the effects of 2C-B because of its unpleasant body effects or 'body load'. Unpleasant stomach effects, gastro-intestinal distress (diarrhea, cramps & gas) are not uncommon. There are also several reports of allergic type reactions causing increased mucus production, occasionally this results in coughing as mucus gathers in the windpipe and lungs. 
 
 Other possible negative effects include anxiety and unwanted or frightening thoughts and visions. 2C-B, though significantly lesser common than with LSD, can precipitate strong, temporary changes in an individual's experience of life and reality. It can be a powerful psychoactive experience, especially at higher doses, which is significantly affected by experiences, set and setting. Recent experiences, especially strong ones, can have a substantial effect on a trip. Physically or psychologically unsettling events in the days before a trip can blossom into more serious distress and trauma while tripping. It is important to be prepared for the possibility of encountering difficult or frightening mental states. The [Psychedelic Crisis FAQ](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/faqs/psychedelic_crisis_faq.shtml) addresses some of the issues involved in dealing with a difficult trip.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take 2C-B if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-B and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. If you have a seizure or convulsive disorder or heart problems, you may be at higher risk for health problems when taking 2C-B. Diabetics should monitor their blood sugar closely as there have been some reports of problems. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-B as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
2C-B is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-B use. Using 2C-B two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

The effects of 2C-B have been described as a cross between the effects of LSD and MDMA, but that it is nothing like a combination of the two. It is mildly psychedelic, much less mind-expanding or disassociative than mushrooms or LSD, but much less directed than MDMA. 
 
 2C-B includes Open Eye Visual (OEV) effects which are usually described as crawling, shifting, or undulating, or cartooning. Closed Eye Visuals (CEVs) are present and increase with dosage. Many report a 'color shift' where objects seem to have red / green halos around them. 
 
 2C-B has a large 'body' component which some describe as "body tripping." Shulgin and others say that 2C-B can bring body-issues forward or make them more prominent and, in this way, some people say it can be a self-diagnostic tool for body work. Many, but not all, people experience stomach discomfort sometimes including mild diarrhea, gas, nausea and (rarely) vomiting. One user has reported a very a recurrent effect of increased mucus production at the base of the trachea, causing constant coughing during the effects of 2c-b, pseudoephedrine seems to clear this up. 
 
 In general, 2C-B has a somewhat 'positive' mood push as well as a mild stimulant effect, but it is far less stimulating and far less forcefully positive than MDMA. Some people find they can sleep once the peak is over (about 60-90mins after the effects start). 
 
 Most people experience 2C-B as being much 'lighter' on their body than MDMA with far less 'crash' and much less physically draining. It is also not as 'easy' as MDMA, in that it is more of a 'true' psychedelic -- allowing the users mind to become manifest and create the experience instead of being 'pushed' into a positive mood space as MDMA usually does. 
 
 Some people find the stimulating and body effects to combine in a way that is sensual or sexual and Shulgin has said that if an effective aphrodisiac is ever discovered, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B. Many people, however, find it very un-sexy with the body effects being experienced as somewhat disquieting. 
 
 Some people find 2C-B increases their ability to communicate verbally, while others find themselves unable to elucidate their ideas clearly. Some people describe a type of confusion that can be part of the experience, a type of 'stoned' feeling of mental and physical relaxation or floppiness which can translate in inability or lack of desire to go into complex intellectual processes. 
 
 2C-B at medium and low doses has the interesting character that it is often quite easy to move into and out of -- that going from feeling very involved in the experience to feeling quite 'sober' can be very fast and sometimes unexpected. Some people describe 2C-B as being more 'plastic' or 'malleable' than other psychedelics because one can learn to manipulate the depth of the effects. 
 
 2C-B can be used in some of the same ways MDMA is used for working through interpersonal issues and dealing with emotional conflicts. 
 
 'Inappropriate' smiling or giggling is common with 2C-B and other psychedelics. 
 
 As with all psychedelics, many people experience the coming up period as being somewhat cold and shivery. 
 
 As dose increases, the chance for feelings of fear and uncertainty increase. 
 
 As with other entheogens, it is unsafe to drive or use dangerous equipment with 2C-B because it effects attention span, visual acuity, concentration, and coordination. If you work with 2C-B, plan your entheogen experiences carefully and think ahead so you don't ever find yourself needing to drive during the experience.

## SYNTHESIS
In a round-bottomed 2 L flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and placed under an inert atmosphere, there was added 750 mL anhydrous THF, containing 30 g LAH. There was then added, in THF solution, 60 g 2,5-dimethoxy-Î²-nitrostyrene. The final solution was a dirty yellow-brown color, and it was kept at reflux temperature for 24 h. After cooling, the excess hydride was destroyed by the dropwise addition of IPA. Then 30 mL 15% NaOH was added to convert the inorganic solids to a filterable mass. The reaction mixture was filtered and the filter cake washed first with THF and then with MeOH. The combined mother liquors and washings were freed of solvent under vacuum and the residue suspended in 1.5 L H2O. This was acidified with HCl, washed with with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2, made strongly basic with 25% NaOH, and reextracted with 4Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. The pooled extracts were stripped of solvent under vacuum, yielding 26 g of oily residue, which was distilled at 120â130 Â°C at 0.5 mm/Hg to give 21 g of a white oil, 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-H) which picks up carbon dioxide from the air very quickly.

To a well-stirred solution of 24.8 g 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine in 40 mL glacial acetic acid, there was added 22 g elemental bromine dissolved in 40 mL acetic acid. After a couple of min, there was the formation of solids and the simultaneous evolution of considerable heat. The reaction mixture was allowed to return to room temperature, filtered, and the solids washed sparingly with cold acetic acid. This was the hydrobromide salt. There are many complicated salt forms, both polymorphs and hydrates, that can make the isolation and characterization of 2C-B treacherous. The happiest route is to form the insoluble hydrochloride salt by way of the free base. The entire mass of acetic acid-wet salt was dissolved in warm H2O, made basic to at least pH 11 with 25% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent gave 33.7 g of residue which was distilled at 115â130 Â°C at 0.4 mm/Hg. The white oil, 27.6 g, was dissolved in 50 mL H2O containing 7.0 g acetic acid. This clear solution was vigorous stirred, and treated with 20 mL concentrated HCl. There was an immediate formation of the anhydrous salt of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-B). This mass of crystals was removed by filtration (it can be loosened considerably by the addition of another 60 mL H2O), washed with a little H2O, and then with several 50 mL portions of Et2O. When completely air-dry, there was obtained 31.05 g of fine white needles, with a mp of 237â239 Â°C with decomposition. When there is too much H2O present at the time of adding the final concentrated HCl, a hydrated form of 2C-B is obtained. The hydrobromide salt melts at 214.5â215 Â°C. The acetate salt was reported to have a mp of 208â209 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 20 mg) âThe drug effect first became known to me as a shift of colors toward golden and rose tones. Pigments in the room became intensified. Shapes became rounder, more organic. A sensation of lightness and rivulets of warmth began seeping through my body. Bright lights began pulsing and flashing behind my closed lids. I began to perceive waves of energy flowing through all of us in unison. I saw all of us as a gridwork of electrical energy beings, nodes on a bright, pulsating network of light. Then the interior landscape shifted into broader scenes. Daliesque vistas were patterned with eyes of Horus, brocades of geometric design began shifting and changing through radiant patterns of light. It was an artistâs paradiseârepresenting virtually the full pantheon of the history of art.â

(with 20 mg) âThe room was cool, and for the first hour I felt cold and chilled. That was the only mildly unpleasant part. We had been hanging crystals earlier that day, and the visions I had were dominated by prismatic light patterns. It was almost as if I became the light. I saw kaleidoscopic formsâsimilar to, but less intense than, when on acidâand organic forms like Georgia OâKeefe flowers, blossoming and undulating. My body was flooded with orgasmsâpractically from just breathing. The lovemaking was phenomenal, passionate, ecstatic, lyric, animal, loving, tender, sublime. The music was voluptuous, almost three-dimensional. Sometimes the sound seemed distorted to me, underwater like. This was especially so for the less good recordingsâbut I could choose to concentrate on the beauty of the music or the inadequacy of the soundâs quality, and mostly chose to concentrate on the beauty.â

(with 24 mg) âI am totally into my body. I am aware of every muscle and nerve in my body. The night is extraordinaryâmoon full. Unbelievably erotic, quiet and exquisite, almost unbearable. I cannot begin to unravel the imagery that imposes itself during the finding of an orgasm. Trying to understand physical/spiritual merging in natureâ.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There have been reports of several overdoses that prove the intrinsic safety of this compound. Prove is used here in the classic British sense; i.e., to challenge.  âThe proof of the pudding is in the eating,â is not a verification of quality, but an inquiry into the quality itself.  (The French simplify all this by using two separate verbs for prove.)  One overdose was intentional, the other accidental.

(with 64 mg) I found only mild visual and emotional effects at the 20 milligram dose, so I took the remaining 44 milligrams. I was propelled into something not of my choosing. Everything that was alive was completely fearsome. I could look at a picture of a bush, and it was just that, a picture, and it posed no threat to me. Then my gaze moved to the right, and caught a bush growing outside the window, and I was petrified. A life-form I could not understand, and thus could not control. And I felt that my own life-form was not a bit more controllable. This was from the comments of a physician who assured me that he saw no neurological concerns during this dramatic and frightening experience.

(with 100 mg) I had weighed correctly. I had simply picked up the wrong vial. And my death was to be a consequence of a totally stupid mistake. I wanted to walk outside, but there was a swimming pool there and I didnât dare fall into it. A person may believe that he has prepared himself for his own death, but when the moment comes, he is completely alone, and totally unprepared. Why now? Why me? Two hours later, I knew that I would live after all, and the experience became really marvelous. But the moment of facing death is a unique experience. In my case, I will some day meet it again, and I fear that I will be no more comfortable with it then than I was just now. This was from the comments of a psychologist who will, without doubt, use psychedelics again in the future, as a probe into the unknown.

Many of the reports that have come in over the years have mentioned the combination of MDMA and 2C-B. The most successful reports have followed a program in which the two drugs are not used at the same time, nor even too closely spaced. It appears that the optimum time for the 2C-B is at, or just before, the final baseline recovery of the MDMA. It is as if the mental and emotional discoveries can be mobilized, and something done about them. This combination has several enthusiastic advocates in the psychotherapy world, and should be the basis of careful research when these materials become legal, and accepted by the medical community.

A generalized spectrum of 2C-B action can be gleaned from the many reports that have been written describing its effects.  (1) There is a steep dose response curve. Over the 12 to 24 milligram range, every 2 milligrams can make a profound increase or change of response. Initially, one should go lightly, and increase the dosage in subsequent trials by small increments. A commonly used term for a level that produces a just perceptible effect is âmuseum level.â This is a slightly-over-threshold level which allows public activities (such as viewing paintings in a museum or scenery watching as a passenger in a car) to be entered into without attracting attention. There can be considerable discomfort associated with being in the public eye, with higher doses.  (2) The 2C-B experience is one of the shortest of any major psychedelic drug. Wherever you might be, hang on. In an hour or so you will be approaching familiar territory again.  (3) If there is anything ever found to be an effective aphrodisiac, it will probably be patterned after 2C-B in structure.

There are two âTweetiosâ known that are related to 2C-B.  (See recipe  #23 for the origin of this phrase.)  The 2-EtO- homologue of 2C-B is 4-bromo-2-ethoxy-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2ETO. The unbrominated benzaldehyde (2-ethoxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of 47.5â48.5 Â°C, the unbrominated nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of 76â77 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 185â186 Â°C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 168.5â169.5 Â°C. It seems that one gets about as much effect as can be had, with a dosage of about 15 milligrams, and increases above this, to 30 and to 50 milligrams merely prolong the activity (from about 3 hours to perhaps 6 hours). At no dose was there an intensity that in any way resembled that of 2C-B.

The 2,5-DiEtO- homologue of 2C-B is 4-bromo-2,5-diethoxyphenethylamine, or 2CB-2,5-DIETO. The unbrominated impure benzaldehyde (2,5-diethoxybenzaldehyde) had a melting point of about 57 Â°C, the unbrominated impure nitrostyrene intermediate a melting point of about 60 Â°C, and the final hydrochloride a melting point of 230â231 Â°C. The hydrobromide salt had a melting point of 192â193 Â°C. At levels of 55 milligrams, there was only a restless sleep, and strange dreams. The active level is not yet known.

I have been told of some studies that have involved a positional rearrangement analogue of 2C-B. This is 2-bromo-4,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (or 6-BR-DMPEA). This would be the product of the elemental bromination of DMPEA, and it has been assayed as the hydrobromide salt. Apparently, the intravenous injection of 60 milligrams gave a rapid rush, with intense visual effects reported, largely yellow and black. Orally, there may be some activity at the 400 to 500 milligram area, but the reports described mainly sleep disturbance. This would suggest a stimulant component. The N-methyl homologue of this rearranged compound was even less active.

**4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine** (also known as **Nexus** , **Bromo Mescaline** , **BDMPEA** , **Venus** , and **2C-B** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is perhaps the most well-known member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) , which are structurally related to the classical psychedelic [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . The mechanism of action is not fully known, although [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) binding activity is thought to be principally involved.

2C-B was discovered in 1974 by the American chemist [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who was investigating psychedelic phenethylamines derived from [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) . In the 1970s, it first saw use as a therapeutic aid by a small circle of American psychotherapists and was considered one of the best substances for this purpose due to its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature.

Recreational use was observed shortly afterward and it was briefly manufactured and sold commercially under such names as "Erox" and "Nexus" in "head" / "smart" shops and adult video stores before being federally scheduled in 1995.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [open and closed-eye visuals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) , [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . User reports have described the effects of 2C-B as moderate, warm, colorful, and highly sensual. Similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , it is described as possessing a less serious or grandiose headspace than [tryptamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , placing greater emphasis on the visual and tactile domain.

Smaller doses (under 15 mg) are reported to be useful as a sensory and aesthetic enhancer (in a manner somewhat similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ) while larger doses are reported to produce a distinct mind-manifesting psychedelic effect.

While more research is needed, it is generally thought to be physiologically well-tolerated [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] . It likely has a [safety profile similar to classical psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) , which are known to have low abuse potential and toxicity. However, adverse psychological reactions such as severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) are always possible, particularly for those predisposed to mental disorders.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

2C-B was first synthesized and tested for psychoactivity in 1974 by the American chemist and psychedelic researcher [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who was investigating novel psychedelic compounds based on the chemical structure of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) .

Shulgin's findings were later published in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) , in which he listed 2C-B among the "magical half-dozen" of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) that he deemed most important. The list consists of [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , 2C-B, [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [2C-T-2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-2) , and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) . In interviews, Shulgin repeatedly declared it his favorite psychedelic trip.

In the 1970s, it was used in patients by a small number of psychotherapists in the United States. These therapists reported that it created a warm, empathetic bond between them and their patients, helping to break down their ego defenses and inner resistances and allowing the patient to get in touch with suppressed emotions and repressed memories. The gentle nature of 2C-B, in addition to its mild side effects and short duration, were found to be desirable traits for a therapeutic setting.

Shortly after gaining traction in the underground psychotherapy community, 2C-B became popular in the recreational drug scene. It was well-liked as a [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) substitute in raves and club parties due to its minimal comedown and a clear, euphoric headspace.

In the 1980s and early 1990s, several foreign companies legally manufactured the substance under the brand names "Nexus", "Erox", and "Performax" and advertised that it would alleviate impotence, frigidity, and diminished libido. It was sold at adult book and video stores, "head" shops, and some nightclubs. The DEA reported its distribution in Miami, Florida in the form of yellow pills marketed as an aphrodisiac.

In the United States, it gained popularity as an alternative to MDMA after the latter was classified as a Schedule I substance in 1985. The increasing popularity of 2C-B led to it also being placed in Schedule I in 1995. It saw a resurgence in interest in the 2000s, with the advent of the ["research chemicals"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) /"designer drugs" scene and darknet markets.

2C-B was legally sold in Southern Africa from 1993 to early 1996. It was marketed as medicine for Sangomas (traditional healers) under the name "Ubulawu Nomathotholo", which roughly translates to "Medicine of the Singing Ancestors".

## Chemistry

2C-B, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine, is a [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) . Substituted phenethylamines are a chemical class of organic compounds that are based upon the phenethylamine structure, a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-B possesses methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a bromine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring.

2C-B belongs to the [2C family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) of phenethylamines, all of which possess methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

Unlike most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) 5-HT 2A receptor [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) or even full [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) . This suggests that the 5-HT 2C receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B. Research also suggests that 2C-B increases [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) levels in the brains of rats which may contribute to its psychoactivity.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 2C-B is typically described as very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that draws comparisons to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . At higher doses this effect can become more forced, encouraging users to engage in physical activities such as dancing.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-B is reported to be one of the most complex among [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , exhibiting aspects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . This is first characterized by an intense soft, warm glow that grows over the body and is capable of becoming highly [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) .
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - While not as intense as stimulants such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , most doses can cause a decrease in appetite.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and cartoon-like in style.
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Depth perception distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depth_perception_distortions)**
- **[Recursion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion)**

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry of 2C-B is reported to be more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) than that of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) . It can be comprehensively described as unstructured in organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp in its edges and angular in its corners. It seems high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
Like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , while 2C-B is capable of producing a full range of low and high-level hallucinatory states, they are comparatively rare and inconsistent at higher levels while common at lower levels. They generally include the following effects:

- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although 2C-B is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity. In comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent at common doses, though are usually readily producible at high doses, particularly when taken by [rectal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rectal) or [intravenous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Intravenous) routes. While traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-B will for most go straight into [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for some, 2C-B is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 2C-B are often described as both insightful and relatively normal in their thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. They are often described as being halfway between [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) but still prove stronger and more consistent than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of any class. This has been reported to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This [introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection) dominant effect is only manifested consistently in the context of a non-social setting in which the user is alone.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) & [Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - while possible at most doses, this effect generally occurs at a considerably lower intensity compared to classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - Combined with the increased bodily sensations and stimulation, 2C-B is capable of making sexual activity extremely pleasurable.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** -
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)**
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - Anecdotal reports and literature suggest that 2C-B is capable of producing sudden fits of mild to intense laughter.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Rejuvenation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Rejuvenation)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of synesthesia, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While 2C-B has been reported as having the potential to produce transpersonal states, they are reported to occur less consistently or intensely than with classic psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis majorly intensifies and extends both the sensory and cognitive effects of 2C-B. Extreme caution should be exercised with this combination as it can also elevate the [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) risk of cannabis.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - When combined with dissociatives, the geometry, euphoria, dissociation, and hallucinatory effects are often greatly enhanced. Dissociative-induced [holes, spaces, and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) while under the influence of 2C-B have significantly more vivid visuals than dissociatives alone. It also results in more intense [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) and corresponding [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) which can develop into [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Nitrous](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrous)** - Nitrous oxide is commonly used in combination with psychedelics. The two are known to possess powerful cross-synergistic effects, including the capacity to send the user directly into an ["ego death"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death) state. The speed and intensity with which this occurs are very rapid and the euphoria that can result often leads to the urge to [compulsively redose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - MDMA strongly amplifies the physical, visual, and cognitive effects of 2C-B. This combination is reported to produce strong sensations of euphoric pleasure manifested through distinct body highs, headspaces and uniquely colorful visuals. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable, and it is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for both substances individually. This combination may increase the neurotoxic effects of MDMA, based on its similarity to LSD, which has been found to increase MDMA neurotoxicity.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Alcohol can increase the disinhibiting and euphoric effects of 2C-B, lending to its use in recreational settings. It can be used in light doses to "take the edge off" a trip as well as dull its psychedelic effects in a manner comparable to benzodiazepines. However, this is not typically recommended due to alcohol’s ability to cause [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) and [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and [physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue) which can negatively affect a trip if taken in moderate to high dosages. Heavy drinking is strongly discouraged as it can easily lead to blackouts and unpredictable behavior.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Depending on the dose, benzodiazepines can slightly to completely reduce the intensity of the cognitive, physical, and visual effects of a 2C-B trip. They are very efficient at stopping ["bad trips"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) at the cost of amnesia and reduced trip intensity. Caution is advised when acquiring them for this purpose due to their high abuse and addiction potential.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - When used in combination with other psychedelics, each substance's physical, cognitive and visual effects intensify and synergize strongly. The synergy between those substances is unpredictable, and for this reason generally not advised. If choosing to combine psychedelics, it is recommended to start with significantly lower dosages than one would take for either substance individually.

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-B use have not been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dose is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (although nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Neurotoxicity

2C-B at normal doses is unlikely to be neurotoxic. Through rough extrapolations of data from rat cortical cultures, the IC 50 of neuronal activity may result from a dose of at least a 330-650mg. In other words, users should avoid a dose that large in order to avoid long term damage, but typical doses should be well within a safe range.

### Cardiac risk

Users have reported experiencing hypertension, hyperthermia and tachycardia at higher doses. As such, those with pre-existing heart conditions should avoid using 2C-B, and users monitor their temperature and heart-rate and respond accordingly. Heavy physical exertion while on 2C-B is discouraged.

### Lethal dosage

There is no current data for the LD 50 of 2C-B, but it is thought to be considerably higher than the active dose. [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) reported a 100 mg oral dose taken without apparent harm.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [serotonergic psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) , 2C-B is considered to be non-addictive with a low potential for abuse.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-B is not built almost immediately after ingestion. There are many anecdotal reports of people ingesting this substance many days in a row (either consecutively or by redosing many many times in a row and tripping continuously for dozens of hours) with no immediate tolerance build up and still building quite slowly even under sustained exposure.

2C-B does not produce cross-tolerance with other serotonergic psychedelics, although most users report other psychedelics affecting 2C-B tolerance. For example 2C-B followed by LSD will not result in any loss of effects whereas LSD followed by 2C-B will. Others report 2C-B following a completely separate tolerance clock to other psychedelics with no cross tolerance being shared between the two, although this seems to be a rare reaction with that individual's personal body chemistry, with the aforementioned one-way tolerance being the case for the very large majority of the population.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-B. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Effects
Perceptions and feelings become more intense. From 10-15 mg (snorted already from 7 mg), the effect usually takes on a hallucinogenic character. The boundaries between inside and outside can dissolve. Often moving coloured patterns and luminous fields around objects and persons are perceived. However, the intoxication is felt to be less profound than with LSD.

## Dosage
2C-B is effective even in small doses; even 2 mg more or less can make a big difference in the effect experienced; a gradual approach to the individual dose is recommended. Doses above 35 mg can be experienced as unpleasantly strong even by experienced users.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pupils dilate, blood pressure rises and nausea, sweating and dizziness may occur. Some users report stomach and intestinal problems, and mild allergic reactions (such as coughing due to increased mucus production) may occur. Disorientation, confusion and feelings of anxiety, even fear of death, are risks on a psychological level.

### Long-term Risks
There are no research results on long-term risks so far.

## Safer Use
- 2C-B seems very setting-dependent and is only suitable for parties to a limited extent.
- Be aware of set and setting: Use 2C-B only in places where you feel comfortable and safe. Do not use if you are afraid of the drug.
- Never consume 2C-B alone and only when you feel mentally and physically well and are well rested.
- Do not add more, dose carefully.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Follow the safer-sniffing rules when sniffing. Attention, 2C-B burns painfully in the nose!
- People with cardiovascular diseases and diabetics are at increased risk when consuming 2C-B.

2C-B is a psychedelic that was created in the 1970s. It’s a member of the 2C family ( [2C-E](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-e/) , [2C-I](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-i/) , etc) and along with having psychedelic effects, 2C-B has aphrodisiac qualities.

The sexual boost it offers occurs more with lower doses and it includes having your mind and body fill up with sexual feelings. An increase in pleasure from sexual activity has been reported.

Depending on the dose you use, 2C-B either offers largely body-centric and erotic effects or psychedelic effects.

While there hasn’t been much research into the drug and we don’t know how much can be used safely, it is considered one of the safer psychedelics. Using a common dose is still wise, however.

  "tripsit-wiki": `# 2C-B

*Source: https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-B*

**2C-B** is a [psychedelic](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics) drug of the [2C-X family](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/2C-X).
Effects are often described as being more easily managed than other psychedelics; it is often compared to a mixture of a LSD and MDMA.
2C-B is also known for the strong body component of its effects which are alternately described as pleasurable energy or a 'sense of being in the body,' and by others as an unpleasant 'buzzing' or body-load, which is mostly occurring during onset.  Users also report open eye visuals in the form of colour distortions, melting like hallucinations, and other minor visual psychedelic effects.

## History

2C-B was first synthesized in 1974 by Alexander Shulgin, and it first saw use among the psychiatric community as an aid during therapy. It was considered one of the best drugs for this purpose because of its short duration, relative absence of side effects, and comparably mild nature. Shortly after becoming popular in the medical community, it became popular recreationally. 2C-B was first sold commercially as an aphrodisiac under the trade name "Eros", which was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle. From many years after it was available as tablets in Dutch smart shops under the name "Nexus".

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systematic name: 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanamine

Unlike most hallucinogens, 2C-B has been shown to be a low efficacy serotonin 5-HT2A receptor partial agonist or even full antagonist. This suggests that the 5-HT2C receptor is primarily responsible for mediating the effects experienced by users of 2C-B, although functional antagonism of 5-HT2A or activation of the 5-HT2A-coupled phospholipase D pathway may also play a role. The rank order of receptorantagonist potency for this family of drugs is 2C-I > 2C-B > 2C-D > 2C-H.

Research suggests that 2C-B increases dopamine levels in the brains of rats, which may contribute to its psychoactivity.

## Harm Reduction

2C-B is known as one of the safer psychedelics, with several reported cases of users far exceeding commonly used dosing limits without lasting adverse physical effects. It is also observed to have a low addiction potential. It is a stimulating psychedelic, and therefore it's important to remain hydrated. Refer to [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for more information.

Do not take heroic doses thinking that 2C-B is one of the "safer psychedelics".

### Interactions

2C-B increases dopamine levels and also has an effect on serotonin. Therefore, 2C-B may react negatively with serotonic drugs like anti-depressants and tramadol.

## Legal Status

Internationally, 2C-B is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. In the Netherlands, 2C-B became a list I substance of the Opium Law despite no health incidents occurring. Following the ban, other phenethylamines were sold in place of 2C-B until the Netherlands became the first country in the world to ban 2C-I, 2C-T-2 and 2C-T-7 alongside 2C-B.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-B*

2C-B, also known as 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine or by names such as Nexus or Erox, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is a synthetic analogue of mescaline. The drug is used as a recreational drug and is usually taken orally. 2C-B produces hallucinogenic, mild stimulant, and mild entactogenic-like effects. Its hallucinogenic effects at typical doses are milder than those of other psychedelics like LSD or psilocybin.
The drug acts as a potent partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. Numerous analogues and derivatives of 2C-B are known, such as DOB, 2C-B-FLY, and 25B-NBOMe among others.
2C-B was developed by Alexander Shulgin in 1974 and was described by him in the scientific literature in 1975. It was legitimately marketed under the brand name Erox as an over-the-counter sexual enhancer in some European countries in the 1980s and early 1990s. The drug also emerged as a novel recreational designer drug and MDMA (ecstasy) substitute in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, it became a controlled substance in the United States in the mid-1990s. 2C-B was one of the first 2C psychedelics to be described. It is the most popular and well-known of the 2C psychedelics and is one of the most widely used designer drugs.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin lists 2C-B's dose range as 12 to 24 mg orally and its duration as 4 to 8 hours. However, in an earlier report, he described an effective dose range of 8 to 10 mg orally and a duration of 6 to 8 hours. Threshold effects occur at a dose of 4 mg orally. A wider recreational dose range of 2 to 55 mg or more orally has been described as well, with a typical dose estimate of about 20 mg. A low dose has been said to be 5 to 15 mg, a moderate dose 10 to 25 mg, and a high or strong dose 20 to 50 mg. Most people use doses of 20 mg or lower. Shulgin and others describe 2C-B as having a steep dose–response curve, such that a small increase in dose can result in an unexpectedly large increase in effects. Over the 12 to 24 mg dose range, every 2 mg increment can result in a profound increase or change in effects. Higher doses are said to lead to more intense but not longer-lasting effects. The drug's onset is about 1.2 hours, with a range of 0.3 to 1.5 hours, and its time to peak effects is about 2.5 hours on average. Effects on average last about 6 hours and are slightly shorter than those of psilocybin. In addition to oral administration, 2C-B may be insufflated less commonly, with doses being approximately one-third of those of the oral route or in the range of 10 to 30 mg and with this route producing more rapid and intense effects.
The effects of 2C-B were reported by Shulgin to include sensory enhancement, brightened colors, visual richness, mental imagery, psychedelic visuals including kaleidoscopic and organic forms, sound distortion, increased appreciation of art and music, passivity, relaxation, emotional changes, euphoria, increased body awareness, tactile enhancement, feeling like waves of energy are flowing through oneself, feeling like one's body is flooded with orgasms, and sexual enhancement. He has succinctly described 2C-B as having "a luxury of sensory enhancement (visual, sexual, gustatory) with a minimum of introspective demands". The drug was one of his favorite psychedelics and one of his "magical half-dozen" most important psychedelic phenethylamines. At doses of 8 to 10 mg, 2C-B was described as consistently producing substantial sensory enhancement, but as not "superimposing hallucinogenesis" or as having "no hallucinogenic effects", with the state being described as quite distinct from that usually associated with psychedelics. It was also said to lack the lassitude that can be associated with psilocybin.
In published reports by other authors, 2C-B has been claimed to produce effects including visual, auditory, and tactile perceptual changes, closed-eye imagery, LSD-like visuals such as colors and geometric shapes, time dilation, MDMA-like stimulant and entactogenic effects, such as being more in touch with emotions, as well as feelings of love, enhanced sociability, and empathy, feelings of peace and well-being, euphoria, a "body high", increased sensitivity to touch, touch feeling pleasurable, and being erotic. The presence of entactogenic effects with 2C-B is said to be unique among most psychedelics, along with certain other atypical psychedelics like 5-MeO-DiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT. 2C-B's effects are often described as being milder and more easily managed than other psychedelics. For example, it is said to be less incapacitating or impairing, "non-ego-threatening", not "mentally challenging" or confusing, not leading to an "extreme headspace", and leaving the mind "very clear". In addition, it is said to produce changes in thought and time perception less frequently. Due to its potential for relatively light effects, the drug has been referred to as the "Diet Coke of psychedelics" or as a "beginner psychedelic". Nonetheless, it has been described as quite visual, with the potential for all of the visuals of LSD but without the head space that LSD and psilocybin produce. However, the visuals are dose-dependent, being mild at lower doses and being more substantial and LSD-like at higher doses. 2C-B is often compared to a mixture of LSD and MDMA or a "candyflip". However, it is described as a "clear-headed candyflip", with entactogenic-like effects, LSD-like effects such as visuals, but a very clear head space. In addition, it is said to not have the same kind of forceful positive mood push that MDMA has, and to be a little more unpredictable and capable of causing bad trips or negative head spaces. 2C-B is said to be more of a "party drug", to be more recreational, and to have less likelihood of challenging, emotional-breakthrough, or mystical-type experiences, relative to psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD.
Formal clinical studies have found that 2C-B produces a mixture of psychedelic, some possible entactogen-like, and some stimulant effects. Specific effects in these studies have included slight hallucinogenic states, perceptual changes, ego dissolution, time dilation, increased creativity, stimulation, vigor, happiness or elation, euphoria, feelings of well-being, reduced anger, enhanced sociability and friendliness, increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, decreased ability to recognize expressions of happiness, augmented emotionality in speech, tenseness, confusion, and mild sympathomimetic effects such as pressor effects, among others. Findings on the entactogen-like effects of 2C-B have been mixed, with some studies reporting that it produces such effects but other studies finding no such effects similarly to psilocybin. However, in other research, both psilocybin and MDMA have been found to increase emotional empathy. Compared to psilocybin in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 2C-B produced fewer negative mood effects, greater positive mood effects, less intense hallucinogenic effects including overall altered consciousness, oceanic boundlessness, ego dissolution, experiential depth, and time dilation, and less cognitive impairment. Conversely, their effects in terms of visual changes and enhanced body perception were equivalent. Besides having more positively valenced mood effects than psilocybin, 2C-B produced MDMA-like positive mood effects with little in the way of negative mood effects. It was concluded that in line with anecdotal reports, 2C-B is non-ego-threatening, lacks the more serious head space of other psychedelics, and has a greater emphasis on visual and tactile changes. It was also remarked that 2C-B may be a more optimal psychedelic for people afraid of the psychedelic experience or at greater risk for negative experiences such as due to high neuroticism, with this applicable for instance in the context of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
2C-B tablets often contain a dose of 5 or 10 mg of the drug. Low doses of 2C-B like 5 to 10 mg orally are said to produce stimulation, entactogen-like effects, and perceptual enhancement, while higher doses like 10 to 20 mg orally are said to produce psychedelic and hallucinogenic effects. 2C-B is frequently used at low doses as a substitute for MDMA. It is often used by people who go to electronic music festivals, also known as raves. The drug is also frequently used at clubs and parties, at home, or in nature. 2C-B is often combined with other drugs, such as MDMA, alcohol, and cannabis. Besides recreational use, 2C-B has been used in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy at doses of 15 to 30 mg orally.

## Side effects

The adverse effects of 2C-B have been studied. They have been reported to include difficulty focusing gaze, trembling, sweating, nausea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, jaw clenching, difficulty breathing, coughing, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle or joint pain, tenseness, confusion, psychomotor slowing, and spatial memory impairment, among others. Autonomic or sympathomimetic side effects include slightly increased heart rate and blood pressure and are lower than the increases with amphetamines and MDMA but similar to those with psilocybin. It produces a slight increase in cortisol levels that is also much lower than the marked increases observed with other psychedelics and MDMA. Hyperthermia has been reported at high doses. Residual side effects of 2C-B have been reported to include insomnia, flashbacks, anxiety, coughing, difficulty concentrating, and depression or sadness, among others.
Severe adverse reactions are rare, but use of 2C-B was linked to significant brain injury in one case report; the alleged "2C-B" was never actually discovered by testing so the only evidence suggesting 2C-B was the cause was the victim's own words, without taking into consideration that adulteration and impurities are very common in illicit drugs. In a later case report of unknown dose, 2C-B caused serotonin syndrome, seizures, severe brain edema, and severe and long-lasting neurological impairment. There is a case report of acquired synesthesia following a single very high dose of 2C-B. There is also a case report of persistent psychosis following a single dose of 2C-B.
2C-B is a potent serotonin 5-HT2B receptor agonist similarly to many other serotonergic psychedelics and hence may pose a risk of cardiac valvulopathy and other complications with frequent long-term use.

## Overdose

At doses over 20 or 30 mg orally, frightening hallucinations, as well as tachycardia, hypertension, and hyperthermia, may occur. The fatal dose of 2C-B in humans is unknown but its safety window is thought to be narrower than certain other psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin similarly to the case of mescaline. It was reported by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) that a psychologist had accidentally taken a 100 mg dose orally without apparent harm. There are three case reports of 2C-B intoxication in the scientific literature as of 2015 and no deaths have been attributed to 2C-B alone as of 2018.

## Interactions

2C-B is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-B. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity. 2C-B may also have interactions with other medications and drugs.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-B acts as a potent partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and to a lesser extent of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor. In one study, it had EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy) values of 1.2 nM (101%) at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, 13 nM (97%) at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and 0.63 nM (98%) at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. In earlier studies, 2C-B was found to be a low-efficacy serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor partial agonist or even antagonist. However, subsequent studies have consistently found higher efficacy of 2C-B at these receptors. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors, 2C-B also shows lower affinity for other serotonin receptors, such as the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors among others. However, while 2C-B itself was not assessed, other 2C derivatives showed little activity as serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists (EC50 = >3,000 nM).
2C-B has been reported to be an allosteric or non-competitive serotonin transporter (SERT) inhibitor or serotonin reuptake inhibitor, albeit of very low potency. Although 2C-B itself was not evaluated, other closely related members of the 2C series, including 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, and 2C-T-2, all showed no activity as monoamine releasing agents of serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine (EC50 = >100,000 nM or "inactive").
2C-B produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. It also shows potent and efficacious anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical research.

### Pharmacokinetics

#### Absorption

2C-B appears to have relatively low oral bioavailability. With 30 mg 2C-B orally, its peak concentrations (mean ± SD) were 5.4 ng/mL and its time to peak concentrations was 2.3 hours. In another study, with 20 mg 2C-B orally, peak levels were 3.31 ng/mL and time to peak levels was 2.43 hours.

#### Metabolism

2C-B appears to undergo substantial first-pass metabolism. It has been shown to be metabolized by liver hepatocytes, resulting in deamination and demethylation that produces several products. Oxidative deamination results in the 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethanol (BDMPE) and 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid (BDMPAA) metabolites. Additionally, 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid (BDMBA) can be produced by oxidative deamination. Further metabolism of BDMPE and BDMPAA may occur by demethylation. Alternatively, the later metabolites can be generated by demethylation of 2C-B followed by oxidative deamination. Deamination of 2C-B is mediated by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B.
There is species differentiation in the metabolism of 2C-B. Mice hepatocytes produce 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenol (BDMP), a previously unknown metabolite. Meanwhile, human, monkey, and rabbit hepatocytes produce 2-(4-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-ethanol (B-2-HMPE), but dog, rat, and mouse hepatocytes do not.
2C-B's metabolites BDMPAA and 4-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenylacetic acid (B-2-HMPAA) in humans occur at peak concentrations 280-fold and 17-fold higher than those of 2C-B with oral administration of 2C-B, respectively.

#### Elimination

The elimination half-life of 2C-B in humans is 1.2 to 2.5 hours.

## Chemistry

2C-B, also known as 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine of the 2C family, also known as the 4-substituted 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamines. It is a synthetic analogue of the naturally occurring phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline found in peyote and certain other cacti.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-B has been described.

### Identification

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test.

### Analogues and derivatives

Analogues of 2C-B include 2C-I, 2C-C, DOB, 4C-B, 2C-B-FLY, and 25B-NBOMe, among others.
DOB and 4C-B are α-alkyl derivatives of 2C-B, specifically the amphetamine (α-methyl) and phenylisobutylamine (α-ethyl) derivatives, respectively. β-Substituted derivatives of 2C-B such as BOB (β-methoxy-2C-B), BOH-2C-B (β-hydroxy-2C-B), βk-2C-B (β-keto-2C-B), and β-methyl-2C-B (BMB) have been described. βk-2C-B shows dramatically reduced potency and efficacy as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist compared to 2C-B.
A variety of N-substituted derivatives of 2C-B have been tested, including N-methyl-2C-B, N,N-dimethyl-2C-B, N-ethyl-2C-B and N-benzyl-2C-B. Most simple alkyl derivatives were considerably less potent than 2C-B, with N-ethyl-2C-B for instance having a 40 times lower affinity for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The N-benzyl derivative however was found to have higher affinity than 2C-B itself, with N-(4-bromobenzyl)-2C-B binding even more tightly. This initial research did not include functional assays of activity, but later led to the development of potent substituted N-benzyl derivatives such as 25B-NBOMe, and 25B-NBOH. Another N-substituted derivative, 2C-B-AN, is an N-benzylphenethylamine-like prodrug of 2C-B.
2C-DB (6-bromo-2C-B) is a ring-substituted derivative of 2C-B. TWEETIO derivatives of 2C-B, in which one or both of the methoxy groups of 2C-B are extended to ethoxy groups, exist as well, such as 2CB-2-EtO. ASR-2001 (2CB-5PrO) is a propoxy TWEETIO and another notable analogue of 2C-B which is under development for treatment of psychiatric disorders.
FLY derivatives of 2C-B like 2C-B-FLY, 2C-B-DRAGONFLY, and 2C-B-BUTTERFLY are analogues in which the methoxy groups of 2C-B on the phenyl ring have been cyclized into furan or other rings to form benzodifuran and other tricyclic compounds.
Cyclized phenethylamine derivatives of 2C-B in which the side chain has been cyclized in some way include DOB-CR (2C-B-CR), 2CB-Ind, 2C-B-5-hemiFLY-α6 (BNAP), 2CB7 (2C-B-5-hemiFLY-β7), TCB-2 (2CBCB), 2C-B-PYR, 2CBecca, 2CJP, 2CLisaB, ZC-B, 2C-B-aminorex, and 2C-B-morpholine, among others. Other related cyclized compounds, while not technically phenethylamines or 2C-B derivatives, include 2C-B-BZP and 2C-B-PP.

## History

2C-B was first synthesized and evaluated by American chemist Alexander Shulgin in 1974. He described the properties and effects of 2C-B in humans, along with those of 2C-D, in the scientific literature in 1975. Shulgin proposed 2C-B and 2C-D for use in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. However, it was reportedly abandoned for such purposes due to gastrointestinal side effects and lack of entactogenic effects.
2C-B was legitimately marketed and sold as an over-the-counter sexual enhancer under brand names like Erox in several European countries such as Germany in the 1980s and early 1990s. It was manufactured by the German pharmaceutical company Drittewelle and was sold in adult stores, smart shops, and some nightclubs. In addition, 2C-B was sold in Dutch smart shops as an ecstasy-like legal high under names like Nexus. 2C-B was first encountered as a novel recreational designer drug in the United States in 1985. It was advertised and used as an MDMA substitute after MDMA was made illegal around this time.
2C-B has been said to have been legally sold in Southern Africa from 1993 to 1996 and used as an entheogen by the Sangoma, Nyanga, and Amagqirha people in place of their traditional plants; they refer to the chemical as Ubulawu Nomathotholo, which roughly translates to "Medicine of the Singing Ancestors".
The drug became a controlled substance in the United States in 1994. It also became a controlled substance in most other countries in the mid-1990s. In addition, 2C-B was placed in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and hence became an internationally controlled substance in 2001. Following 2C-B's restriction, other 2C psychedelics emerged as designer drugs. Nonetheless, 2C-B is the most popular of the 2C psychedelics. Numerous other 2C drugs besides 2C-B have also been made controlled substances. Besides other 2Cs, derivatives of 2C-B such as 2C-B-FLY and 25B-NBOMe have been developed and emerged as well-known novel designer drugs.

## Society and culture

### Names

Brand names and street names of 2C-B include Nexus, Venus, Bromo, Erox, Perfomax, Bees, Toonies, Spectrum, XTC, and Synergy, among others.

### Illicit forms

Street purity of 2C-B, when tested, has been found to be relatively high. Researchers in Spain found that 2C-B samples in the country doubled between 2006 and 2009, switched from primarily powder form to tablets, and exhibited "low falsification rates". An analysis of street samples in the Netherlands found impurities "in small percentages"; only one of the impurities, the N-acetyl derivative of 2C-B, could be identified, and comprised 1.3% of the sample. The authors suggested that this compound was a by-product of 2C-B synthesis.
In 2011, street prices in the United States ranged between \$10 and \$30 per tablet when purchased in small quantities. Larger retail purchases cost between \$200 and \$500 per gram. Wholesale purchases of 2C-B would lower the price (\$100 to \$300 per gram in 2001, \$30 to \$100 on the darknet in 2020).

### Legal status

#### United Nations

The UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs added 2C-B to Schedule II of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in March 2001.
