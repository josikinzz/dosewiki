# Plural/Singular Normalization Report

## Summary of Changes
- **Previous version**: 2004 synonym groups, 190 with multiple variants
- **Updated version**: 2001 synonym groups, 194 with multiple variants
- **Improvement**: 3 fewer total groups, 4 more groups with actual synonyms

## Plural Normalizations Applied

### Successfully Grouped Plural/Singular Pairs
The following plural/singular variations are now properly grouped:

#### Visual Effects
- colors/colours → color
- patterns → pattern
- visuals → visual
- hallucinations → hallucination
- distortions → distortion
- tracers → tracer
- fractals → fractal

#### Physical Sensations
- sensations → sensation
- tremors → tremor
- twitches → twitch
- palpitations → palpitation
- vibrations → vibration
- tingles → tingle

#### Body Parts
- pupils → pupil
- eyes → eye
- extremities → extremity
- hands → hand
- feet → foot

#### Mental Effects
- thoughts → thought
- insights → insight
- delusions → delusion
- dreams → dream
- feelings → feeling

#### Medical Terms
- seizures → seizure
- arrhythmias → arrhythmia
- symptoms → symptom
- effects → effect

#### Other Common Terms
- episodes → episode
- attacks → attack
- headaches → headache
- cravings → craving
- changes → change
- disturbances → disturbance
- inhibitions → inhibition

## Examples of Improved Groupings

### Before Normalization
- "Anticonvulsant effect" - standalone
- "Anticonvulsant effects" - standalone
- "Headache" - standalone
- "Headaches" - standalone
- "Palpitation" - standalone
- "Palpitations" - standalone

### After Normalization
- **Group**: "Anticonvulsant effect"
  - Anticonvulsant effect
  - Anticonvulsant effects

- **Group**: "Headache"
  - Headache
  - Headaches

- **Group**: "Palpitation"
  - Palpitation
  - Palpitations

## Conservative Approach Maintained

The normalization still maintains the ultra-conservative approach:
- Different intensities remain separate (mild vs moderate vs intense)
- Different dose contexts remain separate (at high doses vs at higher doses)
- Different timing contexts remain separate (on comedown vs during peak)
- Compound effects remain intact (anxiety/panic stays separate from anxiety)

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

While plural/singular normalization has been successfully implemented, there are still opportunities for further synonym grouping:

1. **Hyphenation variations**: mood-lift vs mood lift
2. **Spelling variations**: color vs colour (already partially handled)
3. **Abbreviation expansions**: GI vs gastrointestinal
4. **Similar phrasings**: "increased X" vs "elevated X" vs "heightened X"

These could be addressed in future iterations while maintaining the conservative grouping philosophy.
