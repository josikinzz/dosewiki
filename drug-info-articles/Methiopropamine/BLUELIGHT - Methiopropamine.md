Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Are you talking about vaping specifically? If this is a general warning about every ROA then I've got some serious thinking to do.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

2-AI is pretty good, if anyone is looking for a clean stimulant.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Are you talking about vaping specifically? If this is a general warning about every ROA then I've got some serious thinking to do.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

If 2-fma can put it to shame, I don't even want to imagine what MPA could possibly be like.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Are you talking about vaping specifically? If this is a general warning about every ROA then I've got some serious thinking to do.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Are you talking about vaping specifically? If this is a general warning about every ROA then I've got some serious thinking to do.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

2-fma puts them all to shame.

If 2-fma can put it to shame, I don't even want to imagine what MPA could possibly be like.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

If 2-fma can put it to shame, I don't even want to imagine what MPA could possibly be like.

2-AI is pretty good, if anyone is looking for a clean stimulant.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Are you talking about vaping specifically? If this is a general warning about every ROA then I've got some serious thinking to do.

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

The other day I tried some methiopropamine. My god that was the most disgusting thing I ever put in my body. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Agreed. While ethylphenidate usually gives me trouble sleeping it feels rather clean (if sometimes a little jittery). Very powerful mindset too. EPH I'm a confirmed fan. MPA is complete junk.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

That's pretty true, especially of powdered, synthetic types. Although I've used MPA quite a lot and never really adjusted to how bad it tastes!

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know).

Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one. EPH is kinda like cocaine in that it produces a feeling of "I can do anything, fuck everyone who isn't me" so pretty good for studying, not great for socialising (well, not great for everyone who isn't you ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

I wonder why MPA is such a strong vasoconstrictor?

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).

Either I didn't take enough (60mg), used the wrong ROA (oral, and yes, it's a bit disgusting) or got scammed (reputable vendor, but you never know). As far as I'm concerned eph > mpa, but then you have a lot of people saying the opposite. Guess it's an individual thing.

Although unfortunately it doesn't stop the vasoconstriction and load on the heart from worsening (due to the accumulative effect) so I'd advise everyone to stop immediately and take a good break as soon as you realise you've hit this point. It's the point at which you're quite likely to push yourself over the edge and into the next life.


By the by, this stuff is scarily easy to use on a daily basis. As long as you're not using it in quantities where it really interferes with sleep and you're getting a good 8-10 hours (factoring in some extra brain recovery time there) then you can easily use it for weeks on end. Don't though.

Not really, no. There's a few posts towards the back of the last megathread involving discussion about how MPA is actually a very dirty drug. Not a recommended study aide at all. Whilst I personally don't think much of ethylphenidate (EPH), you'd probably have a lot more luck with it than this because it's considerably cleaner but requires a little more respect to avoid going on a bad one.

I should have read up on this chemical more before ingestion. I didn't realize that vaporizing it produces sulfur oxide/dioxide... It's a little late now.. Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured. 


Can anyone take a guess at what kind of long term and short term side effects I'm going to experience? I'm wondering whether or not I should go to a doctor. I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now. My voice has also deepened and is quite gruff.Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations.


I did some calculations, but i'm no chemist so they are a bit shoddy. 


I think there is about 174 mg of sulfur total in the 4 grams i've ingested. This averages out to 3.86 mg a day over the space of six weeks. I tried to calculate how much sulfur dioxide i've inhaled but I got a bit confused by the PPM side of things.. 


If anyone with better knowledge of the field could help me out, please chime in. Also if anyone can suggest anything that might minimize the damage i've already caused (vaporizing something else eg. water?) that would be greatly appreciated.


I've stopped consumption and I'm going to do a hell of a lot more research before i start vaping strange chemicals again.

Apparently sulfur oxides are toxic to the point that they can kill you at relatively low concentrations. I've vaped about 4 grams of it over the last 6 weeks. Very silly of me, but I don't want to be lectured.

I've already got a sore throat and what I assumed was just a cold. I'm thinking more along the lines of lung infection and irritated throat/mucus membranes now.

Definitely go see a doctor, mate. Don't take chances, your long-term health isn't worth it. Even if it only tells you the results of what you've done, at least you'll know.


Not gonna lecture you though cos most of us on here will have been wide awake at 4am making desperate pleas to our various gods to survive through the night at one point or another. I'm an atheist and even I've done something similar with whoever might be listening (the first and last time I ever took mephedrone comes to mind).
