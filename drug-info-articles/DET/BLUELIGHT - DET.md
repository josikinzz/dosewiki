A bit surprising that BL doesn't have a B'nD-style thread for DET but that is understandable since it is so rare. That said, I'd been blessed with the opportunity to try it... a good friend gave me a small sample out of his collection (so don't get too excited, it is still off the market AFAIK).


50mg of the freebase were measured out (+/-3mg). Nice yellow crystals, strong indole smell. It was dissolved in vinegar (5% acetic acid) which either wasn't enough to get it all to dissolve, or that the acetate isn't the best salt. 


This was loaded into a syringe using a cotton filter, which in turn was fitted with a '22 wheel filter and piggybacked into another syringe with a needle on it. By the time it got through all this, the fluid amount was also reduced, so I assume I got no more than 40mg total dose, probably less. Still, it was fully-active at a +++ at that dose!


The buildup was very gentle and gradual. The effect was very "stroboscopic" - in that the drug seemed to be indecisive of what it felt like doing to me. Here there is some imagery of a pretty fractal, there is a small analysis of a certain person in my life, yet there a certain song kept playing in my head with strong synaesthesia. 


At the peak, all these things seemed to have gotten a bit more together. Still, although powerful and full of potential, the experience was found to be very "malleable" and it did not feel like the drug itself had a drive to go anywhere. The ego remained pretty entact and there was a lot of clarity in thought. This is absolutely nothing like DPT or DMT (as ayahuasca), a very unique psychedelic. It seemed that I could stir the trip to whatever direction I wanted, more or less, but this may have been dose-related.


Also make no mistake, that while it is very gentle and clear, this is still a fully-fledged classical psychedelic. Of note is the fact that is far superior than its 4-AcO homologue (as is the trend with me seems - simple tryptamines > ring substitutions). 


There was a 30min peak during which there was a very strong jaw tremmor identical to DPT, but also that themes were coming together: and that these themes were very positive, despite what a negative time I'm in. I found myself highlighting the fact that I am liked, and how people actually do like me - something I am generally not conscious of. At the 2h mark there was a sharp drop in effects, with an almost complete return to baseline at the 4h point, at which point I took a nap. During this drop, there was a sudden strong urge for intimacy. Not necessarily sex, just a very sensual urge.


This has definitely become an instant classic, and I will be experimenting more with it at a higher dose and perhaps a better salt (fumarate?). 


It has also been a perfect re-introduction to psychedelics for me, after several years of avoiding them.

Def the gentle one among the simple tryptamines. Does what DMT ~& DPT does, but isn't 'in your face' and pushing the issue (DPT can get a bit uncomfortable at times because of that). Strange seeing how the diethyl analogue of psilocin is, IMO, more anxiogenic than any of the other 4-hydroxytryptamines

^ I've found the acetate ester to not be too anxiogenic, weird yes, but definitely easier than psilocin... not sure about the hydroxy. 


But DET itself definitely won my respect. I will be trying it again at a higher dose, but damn this was the first time I'd used wheel filters and I didn't realize they wasted so much...

Well improved in that I can now IM powders without freaking the fuck out (so much so that I never IMed powders before), but wasted in that it seems to eat part of the dose.

Are there any aspects of the trip that you would describe as bridging the experiential gap between DMT and DPT?  Those two are highly distinct in my experience, and I've always hoped, probably naively, that using all three at the same time would cohere into something profoundly expansive.

This is one of the few simple tryptamines i have left to try.

Hopefully it passes through my hands someday ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Anyone else with experience with DET want to add their thoughts.

I agree that DMT and DPT are very different, and that DET is just as different, too. The three have little in common other than being tryptamines ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Each seems to have a different use, although I have yet to try DMT as non-ayahuasca. I'd definitely be up to IMing or IVing it if found pure.

In my experience ayahuasca is superior to IM synthetic DMT.  The real advantage of synthetic DMT in my opinion is being able to combine it with things that are contraindicated with MAOIs or are likely to cause nausea with ayahuasca or other bad reactions (MDMA, aMT, ketamine, etc.). IV also allows higher dosing for those who find smoking really harsh. 


When I combine DET and DPT with DMT, the DMT may be in the form of ayahuasca. The MAOI would keep all of them going longer, which would be nice. I haven't noticed a detrimental effect of using MAOIs (harmala) with DPT either, so I imagine whatever tainting influence harmala may have on the combination it probably won't make the experience any less fascinating or valuable. 


It's interesting that DET is so unique, rather than an average of DMT and DPT.  A lot of MET reports indicate it's fairly similar to DMT, but lighter, so I wasn't sure. I assume you haven't tried MET for a comparison? I'm excited to get to know DET on its own as well as introduce it to its homologic siblings.

I have tried neither MET nor MiPT (never really pursued them), but now (as in these days after the DET), my interest is roused again in simple tryptamines, and would try MET and MiPT if found (and AET, and any other available simple trypts, though I am not aware of any others available that I haven't tried).


But btw, to one clue to your wondering is MiPT's relation to DMT and DiPT (or lack thereof). MiPT (at least, from the reports) neither produces the out-worldly experiences of DMT, nor the pitch-shift of DiPT. It is a completely distinct drug.


I will probably be trying PiPT very soon, and will report on my findings with that...

^simple trypts are very special (at least the few that ive tried)


I think you would have really appreciated MET.


I took me a while to really understand it, due to its subtlety, but then it was like something clicked and towards the end of my gram i was **loving** the stuff.

I never got to try it IM, which i feel may be the best MOA for MET and most other simple trypts.

This tryptamine has the broadest spectra of individual reactions to be seen in people who take it, perhaps as broad as are the individual reactions to AMT. Ranging from "took 500 mg and felt almost at the baseline" to almost DMT-like experiences with 180-200 mg per os. What I've heard about it from various people most frequently was, either a weak tryptamine akin to MiPT with little to no changes in sensory perception and weak to moderate impact on thinking, and that is what it was like in my own experience. Or a tryptamine somewhat more intense, though not a strong one anyway, with more pronounced visuals and sometimes pleasant somatic (like those of own body motion) or tactile sensations, and with mind effects being moderate to strong - so to be enough to induce a troubling desorientation in highest doses. Individuals with an almost DMT-like reaction seem to be a rarity.


DET has a pronounced bodyload during the come-up, much stronger than that of classic dimethyltryptamines. With a dose higher than 120 mg of the HCl salt taken orally it resembles a food poisoning: yo're going hot and cold all over, the heart rate is increased, plus sweating, nausea and weakness. It passes as soon as the effects reached plateau, but not completely. An indefinite sickness that seem like being linked with motor coordination impairment is always present in tryptamines bearing long alkyls in my experience. It is perhaps not something unique to long alkyls, such coordination impairment is also to be found in DMT, although not annoing or in any other way unpleasant. In DET this is coupled with feelings of being intoxicated and slightly sick, everything taken together resembles GHB. It feels exactly the same in DPT, though much more intense so to be compared with a GHB overdose. 


I find some effects classic tryptamines are famous for to be reduced to almost nil in DET and completely absent in DPT, with no other interesting properties added to compensate it. The larger the substituents on the amino function are, the worse it gets. Unfortunately this is a rule and not an accident, true for any tryptamine with both alkyls on the amine function longer than methyls. It would, perhaps be better to say that the nature of their effects is so much different from those of classic tryptamines, that trying to make comparisons between them is not even legitimate. And unfortunately almost all of TIHKAL is about replacing these methyls with longer alkyls, with such defective tryptamines as a result.


Most importantly, long alkyls lack the delicate emotional amplification that make an ordinary perception to become so exciteful in classics. For the same reason these tryptamines are anything but "spiritual". There is no feeling of a wonder and no "wonders" do happen. The experience lacks development, and the trip is uneventful, even a trip as intense as 100 mg DPT i/m. DPT is an extreme case for me in being devoid of any substantial emotional experience as well as imaginery. DET feels like it could be a little more promising, but anything it might have to offer would apparently be beyond my reach.


In the emotional state I used to get from DET there is some inner warmth that has a (classic) tryptamine touch to it, but that warmth is something more like a contentment, not an amusement or wonder I'd expect from a comparable low dose of mushrooms. 


Usually I do not have any OEV in <150 mg DET to speak about, those that are present are very simplistic, like thin concentric circles covering the smooth surfaces, and brighter colors. CEVs are mostly coloured clouds and phosphenes. There are no scenes or easy fantasy with the eyes closed as long as the dose remains below 150 mg. Raising the dose above 150 mg make it a little more rich, but also makes the bodyload more intense, so that it can no longer be easily ignored.


I could only get something comparable to a moderate phenylethylamine trip out of DET with a 300 mg dose. That was the highest dose I ever took and it made me feeling sick for quite a long time, having ruined it completely.


Even being so pathetic it has some positives if a more positive description is required. It is a mostly pleasant little nothing, not too long and rather harmless. Still not an extraordinary drug though.

^^ Erny makes, and then illustrates some good points....ie the variability in response to DET. (and other tryptamines IMO....I'm suprised of your take on lengthening the alkyl chain Erny, I get almost the exact opposite of effects, esp concerning DPT!) And I am assuming your ROA wAs oral with DET by the description and dose?


I really always enjoyed DET. Very mellow and calming, I've described it a psychedelic blanket in years past, or as the MMDA of alkyltryptamines. I always used i.m administration, and usually at around 50-100 mg. 70-80 wasnt overly intense, but i rarely pushed it higher, because i wasnt looking for overly intense. I'd climb smooth and quick, slight tremor, and start to descend around an hour and a half, and quickly down and done by 3. I could almost drift off into reverie at the peak, verging on a twilight sleep, but only mentally. My body definitely retained some physical stimulation throughout.....similiar to the dreaminess of psilocin.  


I really used to enjoy mixing alkyltryptamines with ketamine, but for some reason DET didnt live up to the expectations set by its brethren. It wasn't bad per se, it just didn't synergize  to the phenomenal degree that DMT and esp DPT did. Goes well with cannabis.


Cheers.

All the doses I wrote there were oral. I have tried to smoke DET but found this not worth the effort. The smoke was harsh, perhaps not too harsh to complain but I had to smoke much and enough for smoking it to be unpleasant, >50 mgs. 


Also tried to i/m it several times, this ROA was frequently one of the best for tryptamines in my experience. But with DET I found the bodyload during the come-up to be extremely unpleasant at the higher levels, though shortened in duration if compared with the oral ROA. For that reason I used an obscure trick to lenghthen it when taking ~ 200 mgs orally: I took it in a freebase form, as large crystals, and in a gelatine capsule. That lenghthened the come-up somewhat without weakening too much the intensity of the effects.

Interestingly the bodyload in EPT (N-ethyl-N-propyl tryptamine) and MPT (N-methyl-N-propyl) wasn't anything like a problem, being much milder than in DET in both of those. EPT was perhaps just potent enough for me not to intend to raise the dose too high so to become sick. It was also rather mild in MET and MiPT.


But DET, DPT and DiPT were all more or less unpleasant at the physical level.

^Heh, a quick look at mi5's last post date indicates the user is probably still around, but I'm betting they know that by now. I never did get to do the DMT, DET, DPT combination, regrettably. I was annoyed to find that the last of the small sample I had of it was absorbed into a partially dissolved plastic bag (thought I had stuck it in a vial, whoops). I did get one IM shot of it in with aMT -- the combo psychedelic I wanted to try it with. There wasn't much synergy like with DPT, though. For about 25 minutes the, I think 35mg of, DET just overwhelmed the aMT and then quickly faded (onset it 5 minutes, plateauing at a ++.5).


Despite the arguably conflating effects of the aMT, judging from the body vibes and visuals of my two IM MET experiences, DET is very similar (certainly closer than anything else, which isn't surprising). Of course MET is pretty rare itself, but it's still far more accessible than DET. I could just substitute that for DET if I was going to do the triple simple tryptamine combo above – it's about the same concept  – but since the glitchy repeating effects on time perception described in my DPT report “[Turing Back the Second Seconds](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=79163),” the two times I've used that drug at lower doses have resulted in milder versions of the same highly distracting effects i.e., it's different now and can't play the role I intended for it originally. I still think the combination is worth a shot (pun intended) for anybody who's got the three.

Although it's the golden age for tryptamine access, I've still never seen this one!  But I want to... anyone have any reports?  Someone told me it was around recently though it went over my head...

Wow, I can't believe there are still so few posts in this thread! I tried some DET last year. I had about 50mg of what I believe was the fumarate salt and I took it orally. I was worried it wouldn't be enough based on the dose range in TIHKAL, but surprisingly it was a solid dose. It's less potent than MiPT but at least twice as potent as MPT. It felt like what you might imagine it would be like if you've done 4-xxx-DET and some of the other simple tryptamines like MPT, MiPT, MET, or EPT.

Thanks for the info cj.  When I read about these tryptamines I never thought any of them would be available.  In fact for DPT I almost went to that church in New Your City that is allowed to use it.   I can not remember the name of the church.  But I have heard from people that did that and they got preached at while tripping balls.  Not fun.  I wanted more info and I can't say what that experience would be like and if they still do that.  However we all know fast foward a lot more simple tryptamines have surfaced so finally getting to try DPT was interesting.  I always wanted to try DET.  But as stated there is little info and little experience reports. There was no RC market growing up for me so it was a classic psychedelic or nothing.  By classic we had LSD and mushrooms.  Tons of both of those.  That was it, unless you want to count PCP.


We do need more DET reports and even more DET.  It is technically illegal in the US  where as DPT does not seem so.  I wonder if the DET legality expands world wide or are there other reasons we don't see it?  Who knows.  I have done 4-ACO-DET though a while back and liked it.

I found DET to be physically comfortable. Very tryptaminey feeling, but pretty relaxed. Warm neck, similar to DMT. I think I've called it DMT lite in the past, after having tried many tryptamines since trying DET, I would almost say DET not like DMT


Its sparkly and wavy, but most of the real visuals were on the periphery of my vision, so I could never quite focus on them. I was also in a social environment, and there was a fair amount of conversation that occurred smoothly might I add. I wonder if I took a big dose, alone, it would get more visual.


While I would try it again, I am actually much more interested in trying MET. I probably prefer 4-HO-MET to 4-HO-DMT, tho I much prefer 5-MeO-DMT than 5-MeO-MET

Been a long time lurker here and finally wanted make an account to post my DET experiences spanning over one and a half years. The only routes of administration used were either smoking or oral administration, I’ve never attempted IV or IM as I’m really not a fan of needles lol. I also am not on any medication, I don’t smoke and my drinking is basically only like one beer a month, sometimes not even that much. While I did take other psychedelics before I always waited some 2 weeks before performing the DET studies so tolerance would not be an issue. Long text ahead, be warned. So here it goes.


------Smoking route notes------


So as specified above the stuff was either smoked or taken orally without the need for a MAOI. I’ll first focus on the smoking which can be a bit less interesting in its own right so I can have that out the way. Simply put, when smoked at least for me it’s more of a stoning effect rather than a psychedelic vibe. I still get rushes of energy but I remain very clear-headed throughout the entire experience. The effects generally start in some 30 seconds and can last anywhere from 30 minutes to about one hour. Visuals are very subtle and not really pushing and most of the time I barely get any by smoking unless I take a few good heavy hits which can push me into a DMT-esque territory, although still with less visuals. Music is greatly enhanced, damn, everything sounds absolutely amazing and is a joy to listen to. Unlike DMT, I can usually chainsmoke DET and it still retains the effects with no clear immediate tolerance build-up.


The stuff tastes horrible and for some reason I can barely stand smoking the free base directly. I mainly dissolve some in methanol and soak some inert herb with the solution and allow the alcohol to evaporate. Placebo or not, it makes smoking it feel a bit easier to manage for me. A bong or glass pipe were used in most cases, sometimes a joint (again, with inert herb) when I was out with friends. Overall a relaxing experience, totally different from the oral route that’s for sure. The most prominent visual when chill smoking was probably the text on my phone starting wiggling lol. Colour enhancement and some breathing also visible here and there along with some dizziness that became rather easy to control some 2 minutes after inhaling the smoke. Overall I did smoke the stuff about nine times as not being a regular smoker it can screw my throat up for a few days and also the smoke as I said just tastes and smells vile.


------Oral administration notes------


Now with that out the way, time for the truly good stuff. I want to start off with one neat thing that made me instantly love this compound, and that’s the relatively low tolerance it produces compared to other psychedelics, at least in my case the tolerance being pretty much completely reset in three days, sometimes even faster. Another thing to address is the dosage used, pretty much all trips were 100 milligrams or more, up to 200 (rarely 300 but those are few and fer between). Having tripped on this compound 47 times so far I don’t remember the exact dosage of most trips, but above 100 or so the thing that was mostly affected was the length of the trip and effects being felt much faster, with the intensity of the effects remaining similar.


There are two big sub-categories I’ll address, night-time and day-time trips. The effects vary considerably and holy crap this is exciting as hell!! Soooo, depending the way you start the trip will pretty much dictate the rest of your fun time. Start in darkness with your eyes closed and you’ll have zero open eye visuals even with lights switched on later, start during day-time and you’ll have basically no CEVs but damn the OEVs are super nice. Taking it during the night also results in a more philosophical trip which really really isn’t anything like acid or shrooms. CEVs can really get in your face at times but most of the time they are pretty… well-mannered if I can call them that? They’re not (always) the tunnels of eyes and entities you see on DMT either, but rather arabesque and aztec imagery with a general dreamscape aesthetic. Also eyes, lots of eyes and geometric patterns. Placing the hand on my face allows me to “see” its silhouette in my mind which influences the visuals differently every time. When opening my eyes in the darkness the entire room flickers for a few seconds before I do start having some OEVs. Mind you, these visuals only persist in the darkness, light makes them disappear or greatly diminish in intensity.


Taking the compound on a full stomach (so it takes longer to kick in) and then going to sleep is a whole new experience with the dreams up until the middle of the night being extremely realistic and mindfucky and then suddenly shooting up awake with visuals sometimes morphing with the world in the dream.


The other important way of taking the stuff is obviously during the day. On an empty stomach on a relatively high dose I’ve had it start kicking in in less than 30 minutes, although it usually takes 40 to 50 minutes to feel something. On a full stomach it can take well over one hour and I don’t recommend it. The first signs of the trip materialising are some pretty cool nausea (I never had a problem with nausea and seasickness in general so this just amplifies the trip for me) that feels like you’re at sea and these intertwined blue and red electric “threads” appearing around the contours of all surfaces and objects, these especially become apparent very quickly. Colours start being amplified with the visual field getting on a greenish-blue tint. All textured areas start getting incredibly detailed the more you zoom in on them, paper and walls especially have some of the same textures as seen on acid. The magic is in the details, the more you look at something the more magical it becomes.


Looking at the sky is absolute eye candy especially on a semi-cloudy day. Clouds morphing and aztec imagery spanning across the whole sky pulsating in all directions and the entire field of view changing from a green to yellow to red to blue left me on the edge of my seat. Also music amplifies everything.


The one amazing thing (another one??) about DET is that it’s so clear-headed, there’s none of the LSD or shroom mindfuck and I’m not forced to think about my life choices, I can totally relax and become totally invested in the visuals. Sure the head-space is still affected to a certain degree but it’s more philosophical and coming out with new theories rather than having your problems materialising into unavoidable thoughts. The only experience that really made me think my life through was my second DET trip but I’ll touch on that later down the report.


------Report of my latest trip (26/07/22)------


So while I do not remember the details of most trips I have just today taken another dose of DET, 200 milligrams, so I can detail this as a somewhat stereotypical high dose DET trip.


Started as usual, on an empty stomach at 11:00 PM I’ve swallowed 200 milligrams of DET freebase in a gelatin capsule. First effects were felt at the 28 minute mark, the usual initial dizziness. 40 minutes in and the grass outside starts having a more saturated “green”. Living in a semi-urban area and especially now a dry one due to drought (Eastern Europe for anyone wondering) the change in hue was very noticeable. By the 70 minute mark the dizziness isn’t as impactful anymore and now all white or grey surfaces are starting to get VERY textured. The white walls of the neighbouring houses display a variety of random symbols for now with the white fence in front of them presenting geometry of a quasi-aztec variety. Nothing is yet fully developed. I decide to go downstairs cos damn am I getting hungry. This is another thing with DET, the munchies I get from it are ten times worse than weed. I feel like if I don’t eat ANYTHING as soon as possible I’m going to die a slow painful death. Fast forward 10 minutes and a bowl of tuna and corn salad later I feel quite a bit better but my lust for food is not yet satisfied. Another half empty fridge and two apples later and now I can finally rest. That’s how bad the munchies get and hell I’m not even fat to warrant this insatiable hunger. You can’t imagine how horrible this can be if taking the stuff on an empty stomach at night and not being able to eat anything, that’s why I suggest really trying taking it on a full stomach if you decide to trip during the night, this way yes the effects start appearing much slower but you don’t have to devour half the house later while trying not to wake the house up.


By this time visuals are getting more pronounced but I have to stop and look at various things for them to fully develop into pure fantasy. I go into the kitchen which has gray-dotted black floor tiles and a whole show ensues for the following 20 minutes: the more textured the area the wilder the imagination can get, anywhere I looked at the floor I would see DMT-esque landscapes materialising in front of me. It was like I was standing on a glass floor with heaven at my feet… literally. After I had my fun with that I’ve retreated on the sofa and started relaxing with eyes half-closed and legs extended on a leg rest. This was by far the most amazing moment of the entire trip (and all of my trips on DET so far) that also lasted for the longest. With some Shpongle as background music my entire body kept changing colours (wore a black T-shirt and my entire body would start going from red to blue with aztec imagery all over it- couldn’t even see the T-shirt anymore). Legs appeared as if they were slowly detaching from the body and I was left amazed as all the walls around me kept on morphing into an aztec utopia. The wooden floor kept on flowing and various segments of it continuously kept on changing colours with the wood grain strands intertwining to form beautiful abstract lettering glowing and pulsating out of the ground. This continued for more than one hour all of which was pure euphoria combined with unique insights on life, but the enjoyable kind of psychedelic insights.


Having gotten up from my couch potato posture and looking out the window the fields in front of me were rapidly changing colour and the roofs of the nearby houses started slowly being pulled towards me akin to acid. I did stay outside a little but with how bright the sun was and me not having any sunglasses on hand I didn’t want to risk eye damage due to my pupils being as big as an aroused cat’s on crack so I went inside shortly after. The visuals were more pronounced inside anyway, however I did glance over at the nearby trees and the plants in the garden and they were equally textured if looking at them for long enough. Lastly, at the three hour mark, I finally retreated back to my room and stared outside at the semi-cloudy sky where an entire show started manifesting in front of me, like I’ve detailed before starting this trip report.


What was really strange was the duration of this trip, with slight visuals still being apparent eight hours after the trip started, that’s a whole new time record for this substance for me.


------ADDED NEXT DAY------


I still have some slight visuals on bright white surfaces, especially while finishing writing this paper. Slight fractals and some of those “electric threads” still visible at the edges of the paper on my monitor. Also the paper itself appears to be a very pale mix of pink and green with blue on its edges and it’s not pure white lol this is awesome. Very faded fractals start appearing on the white surface if I stare for long enough (15-20 seconds). Pattern recognition is also greatly enhanced still and the sky outside still doesn’t look completely well, “skyish”. Looking out the window again and the white-grey portions of the neighbouring houses still present visuals (still somewhat well defined, possible to see visuals and simple arabesque fractals without needing to stare for more than a few seconds. Returning to the walls in my room, they slightly change their hue from a nice pale green to a more bluish tinge every now and then. Many surfaces seem to at first not do anything but after observing them for a bit longer they suddently “shoot” out towards me for a fraction of a second, like a quick flash of light. The edges of all the walls also appear blended together if it makes sense.


Obviously if looking at the chemical structure DET is closest in structure to DMT so I wanted to rapidly address the key differences and similarities between the two.


-Mindspace: at least for me none of them make me think my life choices in any way unless I specifically make that as the point of trip beforehand. DET CEVs seem to be more "chaotic" and you’re more of a spectator visualising them rather than actively being sucked inside the mindscape. Mind you, this can still happen, especially on high enough doses, and can take you completely by surprise. Entities can appear on DET as well, although they’re not as pronounced and the compound rather focuses on pure fantasy, thinking of things and then having them appear in your mind is a very common occurrence in my trips, this is why I consider it a perfect tool for philosophical monologues as any idea can easily be brought to life in an instant if you just focus hard enough. You feel more like a god over your imagination rather than a prisoner being thrown into the unknown like it often happens on DMT. You watch the actions manifesting from a distance but you can choose to get involved as well if you only think of doing so, it’s hard to explain..


-Visuals: here I’m strictly comparing DMT vs DET with no MAOIs involved so DMT will obviously be inactive when taken orally. However some of the visuals of smoked DMT are similar to the ones on orally taken DET, talk about interchangeability. For this test I’ve chosen my room both times so I can watch the fantasy manifest from the exact same angle both times and compare the results. The tests were spaced by one week and happened around one month ago. The light level in my room was medium-low. DMT caused my entire visual field to slice and the load-bearing column in my room was divided in six or so segments stretching in all directions individually from one another. The entire room also caught on a yellow tinge and imagery akin to the aztec calendar appeared on the ceiling pulsating outwards. The ceiling is at an angle with my room being in the mansarde, with the visuals primarily manifesting on the angled section closest to me. Lo and behold at the peak of my DET trip the exact same visuals were noted, complete with parts (this time different parts but same idea) of my room being sliced and moving left right and centre, almost couldn’t believe my eyes when I’ve seen the similarities. Only that the entire experience was obviously an order of magnitude longer than DMT which really allowed me to fully enjoy the visuals but the headspace was the same, same with the aztec imagery, albeit on DET the visual wonderland was covering more parts the room. On my DMT I was a bit sad the visuals were gone so fast but the second time on DET no complaints really, it really had the perfect duration.


-Movement: DET tends to cause more nausea than DMT but once at the peak I can move relatively easy on DET. Pupils are not always as big as my face and it’s not obvious I am on something unless I’m staring eyes and mouth wide open at the wall with music blasting in the background looking like I’ve just seen the reincarnation of Jesus.


As a last point in the first edition of this report if I can call it that is my second ever trip on DET which scared me shitless. My first ever trip was with 50 milligrams (got a jeweller’s scale that can measure on the milligram scale with not very big errors) and it was pretty uneventful, save for the fact that it was my first text-melting experience ever and something novel is always interesting to explore for the first time. It was more of a test dose so I could get my feet wet before going with a full 100 milligrams. Now, I’ve read and re-read TiHKAL (and PiHKAL, but I was always a tryptamine guy) more times than I can remember up to that point and I somewhat knew what to expect but I still wanted to make sure. Well, it all went well for my first dose and the only major visual was the text on my phone melting a bit and some nausea that didn't affect the experience.


This was all fine and dandy and the very next day I decided to dose again. Well… following an error at the scale (measured something beforehand and forgot to reset it or whatnot) I took 300 milligrams instead of the planned 100. While I can now easily take 300 mgs and be fine with it as I know what to expect, imagine the feeling of taking a soul bending dose and literally be thrown into the unknown for six hours straight; and it’s not like I could tell anyone either so I had to ride it out on my own. With eyes closed it was total mayhem so I tried to keep my eyes open for the first half of the trip, but getting a bit late darker outside I started getting mindfucked by OEVs as well at this point. I am not really a fan of the so-called “ego death” and how everyone has the impression that this is what they experience with every single trip, but I’d be damned if that wasn’t one for me. It was the turning point in my life. Once I recalled the dosages mid-trip in TiHKAL and I remembered that Shulgin’s 400 mg dose, although big, didn’t do any harm to him, I at least calmed down. The headspace was very much like normal psychedelics that times as in it forced me to literally analyse my life and always think about how I measured that dose and whatnot (closing eyes and placing the hand on my face had the same silhouette effect as described above, but an eye opened in the middle of the fucking silhouette and looked at me and goddamnIalmostpissedmyself). Damn the thing was scary at first but mid trip I was actually able to start enjoying it fully. Managed to get up and sit down at my PC and started listening to music, that was my first experience with the orgasmic feeling of listening to heavy metal on DET, damn even now that’s a must do during any of my trips. I then promptly proceeded to have the best time of my life for the remaining three hours or so with a huge grin on my face knowing that everything was fine in the end.


Well, this is it for now, if I remember anything else worth saying I’ll edit this post and add it here so all the important info is gathered in one place. Have a good one!

Wow, thanks for that detailed account!  I encourage you to post it in our Trip Reports subforum... we're trying to build a much more searchable database to rival Erowid's, as we have probably the second largest repository in existence.  Not much on DET (you van tell since the megathread on it - this one - is only 2 pages long from the entire history of Bluelight...)

Sure thing, but I'll first want to rephrase it a bit and add some more stuff before I post a definitive version. And something else that's gonna be interesting to detail, I finally took the plunge today and took my first ever 400 mg dose and holy crap this stuff is INTENSE at such a dose, more so than anything I've tried so far. It completely dissolved reality around me and put to shame all the stuff I detailed above. I mean sure up to a certain dose it can be a daily recreational psychedelic almost but at 400 mg it's a completely different story. But damn this last trip dwarfed all my trips ever so far, it made DMT look like an absolute joke. It also took only 20 (!!!) minutes to almost fully kick in orally which is absolutely insanely fast and it was not even on a totally empty stomach. I'll detail the trip in great detail once I come to my senses.

I freely admit bias but I haven't tried a single tryptamine that wasn't vastly improved by the addition of a 7-methyl moiety. Whatever else it does, it appears to produce significant serotonin reuptake inhibition.


In no way practical - but (R) AMT is more or less identical to MDA (for example).


In short, someone needs to work on a decent 7-methyl-3-carboxyl indole synthesis. It's not controlled and can be used to make dozens of actives.


As for the 5-methoxy derivatives.... two thumbs down.

Thinking about attempting to vape some of my DET in the near future, little concerned tho cuz it has noticably changed color and went from white to a little brownish. Its about 2yrs old at this point and ive just never got around to it. It was confirmed with GC/MS but for whatever reason the person we got it from said they didnt get much from it so, that also hasnt had me jumping at the chance when i have so many other drugs i need to use. But alas i will give it a go soon, i will let you know if something noteworthy happens.

So I tried this several years ago while visiting a friend at Purdue ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


However its about to come back in my life and I will definitely be able to explore it in a lot more depth. When that happens I will update, but since my last post in this thread, I have gotten quite familiar with MET. While it's been years, I would like to say that DET much more closely resembles MET than DMT, although it didn't feel as physically good as MET, and the experience was noticeably shorter. DET was 30 min, MET is closer to an hour, which I actually find kinda odd now

I bet it's still fine. The DET i smoked was probably like 10 years old, it was an off white.
