The drug acts as a very-low-potency serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist.
βk-2C-B was first described in the scientific literature by Richard Glennon and colleagues in 2004. It was first encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2013. The drug has since become a controlled substance in Canada, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

## Use and effects
