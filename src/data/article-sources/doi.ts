**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**DOI**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Likely Analog
 
DOI is unscheduled in the United States. It is likely that it would be considered an analog (of DOB), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any such existing cases (6/21/04). DOI is regularly used in animal and in vitro research, Scheduling DOI would impose substantial costs to brain research.

## SYNTHESIS
To a solution of 2.0 g N-(1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-propyl)phthalimide in 15 mL warm acetic acid which was being vigorously stirred, there was added a solution of 1.2 g iodine monochloride in 3 mL acetic acid. This was stirred for 2 h at about 40 Â°C during which time there was a definite lightening of color, but no solids formed. The reaction mixture was poured into 600 mL H2O which produced a reddish glob floating in a yellow-orange opaque aqueous phase. The glob was physically removed, dissolved in 30 mL boiling MeOH which, on cooling in an ice bath, deposited off-white crystals. These were removed by filtration, washed with MeOH, and air dried to give 1.5 g of N-[1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-propyl]phthalimide as fine white crystals with a slight purple cast. The mp was 103â105.5 Â°C and the mixed mp with the starting non-iodinated phthalimide (mp 105â106 Â°C) was depressed (85â98 Â°C). Extraction of the aqueous phase, after alkalinification, provided an additional 0.15 g product. Anal. (C19H18NO4) C,H,N.

A solution of 0.75 g N-(1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-propyl)phthalimide in 10 mL EtOH was treated with 0.3 mL of hydrazine hydrate, and the clear solution was held at reflux on the steam bath overnight. After cooling, there was a crystallization of 1,4-dihydroxyphthalizine that started as small beads but finally became extensive and quite curdy. These solids were removed by filtration and had a mp of about 340 Â°C (reference samples melted over a five to ten degree range in the area of 335â350 Â°C). The filtrate was dissolved in 100 mL CH2Cl2 and extracted with 2Ã150 mL 0.1 N HCl. The aqueous extracts were washed once with CH2Cl2, made basic with 5% NaOH, and extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent under vacuum gave 0.5 g of a colorless oil which was dissolved in 300 mL anhydrous Et2O and saturated with anhydrous HCl gas. There was obtained, after filtration, and air drying, 0.35 g of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) as white crystals that melted at 200.5â201.5 Â°C. This value did not improved with recrystallization. Anal. (C11H17ClINO2) C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 1.6 mg) âThe general nature of the experience was depressing, with a sad view of life. There was no way I could connect with my emotions. Even my sadness was vague. At about the ninth hour I decided that enough was enough, and this strangely disappointing about-plus-two was aborted with 125 micrograms of LSD. The emotions became present and living within a half hour. I was greatly relieved. The erotic was not a mechanical attempt but a deeply involved feeling with an archetype of orgasm easily available. It was shaped like a flower, richly colored, with an unusual âSâ shape to it. This was a lovely end to a difficult day.â

(with 3.0 mg) âThis is a clear, clean psychedelic. The eyes-closed imagery is excellent, with clearly delineated patterns, pictures, and colors. Perfect for an artist, and next time Iâll devote some time to painting. Total ease for the body, but no help for my smoking problem. I still want to smoke. And at sixteen hours into this I am still at 1.5+ but Iâll try to go to bed anyway, and sleep.â

(with 3.5 mg) âI was at a full crashing +++ for about three or four hours. There was none of the LSD sparkle, but there were moments of âlight-headednessâ where one could move sideways with reality. I could leave where I was right over there, and come over here and get a strange but authentic view of where the âthereâ was that I had left. It would be out-of-body, except that the body came over here with me rather than staying there. This doesnât make sense now, but it sure did then. There was no trace of body impact, and I slept late that evening, but with some guardedness due to the intense imagery. This was no more intense than with 3.0 milligrams, but it was a little bit more to the unreal side.â

(with 1.0 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThere was a clear ++ from the second to the eighth hour, but somehow there was not quite the elegance or the push of the racemate. I was sensible, and managed to do several technical chores in a reasonable way. Easy sleep at 15 hours into it.â

(with 2.3 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThe water solution of the hydrochloride salt has a slightly sweetish taste! I was at a +++ without question, but there was a slight down mood towards the end. And it lasted a really long time; I was distinctly aware of residual stuff going on, well into the next day.â

(with 6.3 mg of the âSâ isomer) âI was at a benign one-and-a-half plus at about two hours, and finally flattened out at a ++. Would I double this dose? Probably not, but half again (to 9 or 10 milligrams) would feel safe for a plus 3. By evening I was near enough baseline to drive into town for a social obligation, but even when trying to sleep later that night there was some residue of imagery; remarkably, it was all in slow motion. The fantasies were slow-paced and sluggish. It would have been interesting to have explored eyes-closed during the day.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A number of studies with DOI in animal models have shown it to have an extremely high binding capacity to what are called the 5-HT2 receptors. Serotonin is a vital neurotransmitter in the brain, and is strongly implicated in the action of all of the phenethylamine psychedelics. The place where it acts, at the molecular level, is called its receptor site. As an outgrowth of the cooperative studies of the medicinal chemists working closely with the neuropharmacologists, a number of compounds have emerged that interact with these sites. But this one interacts with these sites and not those, and that one interacts with those sites and not these. So, there has developed a collection of sub-divisions and sub-subdivisions of receptor sites, all related to serotonin, but each defined by the particular compound that interacts most tightly with it.

Thus, there were serotonin â1â receptors, and then there were â1â and â2â receptors, and then â1aâ and â1bâ and â2aâ and â2bâ receptors, and on and on. These are called 5-HT receptors, since the chemical name for serotonin is 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the scientist would never want to let the layman know just what he is talking about. DOI has been synthesized with a variety of radioactive iodine isotopes in it, and these tools have been of considerable value in mapping out its brain distribution. And by extrapolation, the possible localization of other psychedelic compounds that cannot be so easily labelled. A small neurochemical research company on the East Coast picked up on these properties of DOI, and offered it as a commercial item for research experiments. But I doubt that they are completely innocent of the fact that DOI is an extremely potent psychedelic and that it is still unrecognized by the Federal drug laws since, in their most recent catalog, the price had almost doubled and a note had been added to the effect that telephone orders cannot be accepted for this compound.

The four-carbon butylamine homologue (the ARIADNE analogue) of DOI has been synthesized. A mixture of the free base of 1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminobutane (see preparation under DOB) and phthalic anhydride was fused, cooled, and recrystallized from either methanol or cyclohexane to give crystals of N-[1-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-butyl]phthalimide with a melting point of 76â77 Â°C and an analysis (C20H21NO4) C,H,N. This was iodinated with iodine monochloride in acetic acid to give N-[1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-butyl]phthalimide which was chromatographically distinct from the uniodinated starting material (silica gel, CH2Cl2 ), but which did not crystallize. This was treated with hydrazine hydrate in ethanol to provide 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminobutane hydrochloride which was crystallized from CH3CN/EtOH to give white crystals with a mp of 217â218.5 Â°C and an analysis (C12H19CINO2) C,H,N. This butyl homolog of DOI has been assayed at up to four milligrams, and is without any central effects whatsoever. An experiment with 12.4 microcuries of 131I labelled material with the whole body scanner showed most of it accumulating in the gut and liver, with almost none to the brain.

For those who find such statistics interesting, the parent compound DOI vies with DOB as probably the most potent of the phenethylamine psychedelics as of the moment, and certainly one of the most long lived.

A very important, centrally pivotal, and completely paradoxical compound in this area, is the N,N-dimethyl homologue of DOI, or 2,5-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethyl-4-iodoamphetamine (IDNNA). This compound was the starting point of the study of a large number of homologues and it deserves, and has received, a separate recipe.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 0.5 mg
- Light: 0.5 - 1 mg
- Common: 1 - 2 mg
- Strong: 2 - 3 mg
- Heavy: 3 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 16 - 24 hours
- Onset: 1 - 2 hours
- Come up: 1.5 - 3 hours

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine** (also known as **DOI** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) class. It is a member of the [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) family of psychedelic amphetamines.

The synthesis of DOI was first described in 1972 and its usage in humans was first documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in the 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] DOI is very well-researched compared to most psychedelics. It is regularly used in research as a radioligand to map [serotonin-2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The effects of DOI are often compared to those of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , although notable differences can be distinguished. Besides the significantly longer duration, the experience is commonly reported to be more [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) than LSD, with a more pronounced [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) and a less complex head space. The after effects include long-lasting residual stimulation and [difficulty sleeping](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) , which, depending on the dose and time taken during the day, may persist for days afterwards.

DOI is sometimes sold as a substitute for LSD, or even sold falsely as LSD. This can be dangerous because DOI does not have the same established safety profile as LSD.

Along with its sensitive dose-response and unusually long duration, many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already experienced with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Therefore it is highly advised to approach this highly dose-sensitive, and long-lasting [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using it.

## History and culture

DOI was first synthesized by a team at the University of Alberta in 1972.

## Chemistry

DOI, or 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, is a molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) class. Amphetamines are substituted [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) containing a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . DOI contains methoxy functional groups OCH 3 attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as an iodine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. DOI is the amphetamine, or alpha-methylated analogue, of the phenethylamine [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) .

## Pharmacology

DOI's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy as an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at the [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) , [5-HT2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) and [5-HT2C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_System) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain the subject of ongoing scientific inquiry.

Besides its action as a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , DOI has been shown to be an extremely potent inhibitor of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inflammation at picomolar concentrations in cell studies. TNF-alpha is an important target for research into degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease where the disease process involves tissue damage through chronic inflammation. This could make DOI and other 5-HT 2A agonists an entirely new area for development of novel treatments for these conditions.

DOI has also been shown to induce rapid growth and reorganization of dendritic spines and synaptic connections with other [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) , processes known to underlie neuroplasticity.

A study demonstrated that DOI, [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and noribogaine (a metabolite of [ibogaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ibogaine) ) promote neuritogenesis both *in vitro* and *in vivo* .

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, DOI is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which are capable of becoming uncomfortable and overwhelming. This can result in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging one to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of DOI often described as being notably more intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. However, this effect is reported to be very dose-dependent, as even slight increases in one's dose can result in persisting unpleasant feelings of over-stimulation.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently reported at low to moderate levels throughout most DOI experiences.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the person has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable when it manifests, and may persist throughout the main duration of the experience.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)**

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Increased salivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_salivation)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rarely observed effect but is known to happen in those who are presumably predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, undernourished, overheated, or generally fatigued. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects

#### Hallucinatory states
 
DOI and other psychedelic [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) . This holds particularly true in comparison to other substances within the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , DOI is extremely high in internal hallucinations. They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensibly described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations)** - These are often present during the comedown and can include [shadow people](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Shadow_people) , among other indescribable beings. These external hallucinations are often lucid, interactive, autonomous, and robust. As [sleep deprivation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation) and [stimulant psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant_psychosis) surface, a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) should accompany individuals sensitive to stimulants for the last part of the comedown. The visual effects of psychosis have been reported to blend into the psychedelic visuals around the 16-24 hour mark, sometimes accompanied by auditory hallucinations. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of DOI are described by many as characterized as extreme mental stimulation combined with a powerful amplification of the user's current mental state. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect is not as common at low to moderate doses and is less likely to occur when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account. It should be noted that this inconsistently induced effect is seemingly more likely to manifest when used with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . This combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves with a fraction of their usual amount. It is commonly reported that psychedelics can to a certain extent counteract some of the perceived mental cloudiness or intoxicating effects of THC causing the user to in turn use more cannabis than is needed which can often lead to an overwhelmingly anxious and paranoid headspace which can trigger a ["bad trip"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bad_trip) .
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is typically manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others, and only at lower, non-impairing doses. These feelings of sociability, affection and empathy tend to be weaker and less consistent than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but can still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is consistent in its manifestation and [outrospection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Outrospection) dominant.
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Personal meaning enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_meaning_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)** - This can manifest prominently during a DOI experience, particularly during the [come up](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Come_up) phase, often resulting in bouts of uncontrollable giggles and laughter that can form a feedback loop if around others who are also under the influence.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**

- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DOI do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DOI is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from users suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Overdose

The risk of a DOx overdose is present starting in or past the heavy dose range with sensitive people, or when a DOx is mixed with other substances, particularly [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) or [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . Non-oral routes also seem to exhibit a higher chance of overdosing, perhaps owing to differences in bioavailability, potency and unpredictability of dosage and effects. The effects of a DOx overdose typically include bizarre, [delusional](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion) and sometimes violent behavior, [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [numbness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) and [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) . The user may not be able to communicate and can be severely agitated. At appropriately high doses, more serious side effects such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attack) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) which in turn further affect a dangerously [elevated heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) , [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) may occur. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Severe vasoconstriction typically develops to its peak several hours into the intoxication and may require medical assistance if blood flow is significantly cut off for extended periods of time.

In the event of an overdose, [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can be administered to mitigate the hyperagitative effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] A powerful vasodilator may also need to be administered to prevent a hypertensive emergency, or in more serious cases, necrosis, organ failure and death from the resulting hypoxia. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a result, emergency medical services should always be sought in the event of a DOx overdose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DOI is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of DOI is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 10-14 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DOI presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of DOI all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of DOI. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Effects
At the beginning, typical effects of amphetamine unfold, such as increased alertness, accelerated pulse, slight euphoria, increased self-confidence and urge to talk. Afterwards, the effect changes: one often feels a strong urge to move, sensory perception, feelings and empathy are heightened, colours are perceived more distinctly. With DOB and DOI, coloured, superimposed, pulsating patterns are perceived. This effect is weaker with DOM.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Since the effect of DOI comes on late, the danger of overdosing by refilling is particularly great. The long duration of action poses a psychological burden. Confusion or anxiety is common, especially at high doses. Some DOB users report a burning or pressure sensation in the bladder. At high doses, temporary paralysis, inability to communicate or insensitivity to pain (caution: risk of injury and accidents) may occur. Teeth grinding and strain on the cardiovascular system are also possible.

### Long-term Risks
Due to the long and intense effects, use - especially frequent use - carries the risk of a loss of reality, which can manifest itself in schizophrenic traits and anxiety states. The consumption of DOI can trigger latent (hidden) psychoses.

## Safer Use
- DOM are not suitable as party drugs and should only be used by experienced users.
- Plan your trip ahead because of the long duration of action.
- Never consume DOI alone and only when you feel very well mentally and physically and are well rested!
- Pay attention to set and setting: only take DOI in a place where you feel safe and avoid unwanted disturbances from outside! Prepare yourself well for the trip and prepare yourself internally for the long duration of the effect.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Mixed use of these potent substances should be avoided at all costs.
- As amphetamine derivatives, DOI can be particularly draining because of their long duration of action. Light vitamin-rich food, fruits, vegetable juices, vitamins and minerals promote a soft landing after the trip has subsided and can weaken a hangover.
- Plan enough time for recovery after the trip (at least 1 day)!
- A trip with DOI should remain an exceptional experience. Make sure to take long breaks from consumption so that the experience can be processed.

*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/doi/*

DOI is a psychedelic amphetamine that was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin, who described it in PiHKAL (1991). It has been used recreationally and is a common scientific research tool.

Like other members of the DOx class (e.g. [DOM](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dom/) ), DOI has a long duration of action. It’s not uncommon for people to be incapable of sleeping for 24 hours or more, particularly with strong+ doses.

As we still don’t fully understand its effects in humans, minimizing your use and taking common doses is wise.

  "wikipedia": `# 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine*

2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and DOx families. It is little-used recreationally, but is widely used in scientific research in the study of psychedelics and serotonin receptors. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a potent serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Analogues of DOI include 2C-I, DOB, DOC, DOM, and 25I-NBOMe, among others.
DOI was first described in the scientific literature by Ronald Coutts and Jerry Malicky in 1973. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). DOI has been encountered as a novel designer drug. Owing to their very long and disagreeable durations however, DOI and other DOx drugs have seen very little recreational availability and use. Unlike many other psychedelic drugs, DOI is not an explicitly controlled substance in the United States. However, in 2023, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) began taking steps to make DOI a controlled substance. As of late 2025, DOI is poised to become a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.

## Use and effects

In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DOI's dose as 1.5 to 3 mg orally and its duration as 16 to 30 hours. The effects of DOI have been reported to include feelings of unreality, strangeness, closed-eye imagery, time dilation, having none of LSD's sparkle, depression and sadness, enhanced eroticism, lightheadedness, and spaciness, among others. It was said to have little or no body load. The (R)-enantiomer, (R)-DOI, was active at doses of 1.0 to 2.3 mg orally, whereas the (S)-enantiomer, (S)-DOI, was active at a dose of 6.3 mg orally.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

#### Actions

DOI is a serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist. It is said to be approximately 5- to 12-fold selective for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor over the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug shows biased agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor.
The drug is not a monoamine releasing agent of serotonin or dopamine.
DOI is an agonist of the rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
The compound has a stereocenter, and R-(−)-DOI is the more active stereoisomer. [125I]-R-(−)-DOI is used as a radioligand and indicator of the presence of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in studies.

#### Effects

(R)-DOI and several other serotonergic psychedelics, including TCB-2, LSD, and LA-SS-Az, have been found to show potent inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)-induced inflammation. (R)-DOI was the most active of the assessed drugs and showed extremely high potency that was in the picomolar range and was an order of magnitude more potent than its action as a hallucinogen. TNFα may play a mediating role in the pathophysiology of degenerative inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. (R)-DOI has also been found to block pulmonary inflammation, mucus hyperproduction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and to turn off key genes in pulmonary immune response, effects which block the development of allergic asthma in animal models. These findings could make DOI and other serotonin 5-HT2A agonists novel treatments for inflammatory conditions.
DOI has been shown to induce rapid growth and reorganization of dendritic spines and synaptic connections with other neurons, processes known to underlie neuroplasticity, and hence to be a psychoplastogen.

## Chemistry

DOI, also known as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine or as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo-α-methylphenethylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative and a member of the DOx family of drugs. It is structurally related to the naturally occurring phenethylamine psychedelic mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DOI has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DOI include 2C-I, DOB, DOC, DOF, and DOM, among many others. Other analogues include N-methyl-DOI, IDNNA (N,N-dimethyl-DOI), and DOI-NBOMe, among others.

## History

DOI was first described in the scientific literature by Ronald Coutts and Jerry Malicky in 1973. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The radioactive iodine-125 form of DOI  for PET imaging was first developed in the lab of David E. Nichols.
In January 2007, British police reported that three young men had fallen ill, reportedly, after taking DOI at a rave in Biggleswade, near Milton Keynes, and warned others who had taken it to seek medical attention. This would appear to be the first indication that DOI has found more widespread use as a recreational drug in the United Kingdom.
South Australian man Cody Edwards who brutally murdered Synamin Bell controversially plead guilty to the lesser sentence of manslaughter after attesting that the drug DOI had induced paranoia, and that he had subsequently acted in ‘self-defence’ when he had beaten the mother-of-three to death with a dumbbell, resulting in over fifty wounds.
As of late 2025, DOI is expected to become a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.

## Society and culture

### Scientific research

DOI is widely used in scientific research to study serotonergic psychedelics and the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. This is in part due to the fact that it is not a controlled substance in the United States. However, DOI is poised to become a Schedule I controlled substance in this country in the near future, which will greatly restrict access to the drug. A number of alternatives to DOI have been suggested for use in research, including the non-selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 and the selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists 25CN-NBOH and LPH-5. Another notable but much more recent compound is TGF-8027, which is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist and among the most selective such drugs currently known.

### Legal status

#### Australia

The Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP) of Australia does not list DOI as a prohibited substance.

#### Canada

Listed as a Schedule 1 as it is an analogue of amphetamine. The CDSA was updated as a result of the Safe Streets and Communities Act, changing amphetamines from Schedule 3 to Schedule 1.

#### Denmark

Illegal since 8 April 2007.

#### Finland

DOI is classified as a psychoactive substance banned from the consumer market in Finland.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added DOI to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as narcotics in Sweden as of August 30, 2007,  published by Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2007:10 listed as DOI, 4-jod-2,5-dimetoxi-amfetamin.

#### United States

As of 2023, DOI is not scheduled in the United States. However, DOI may be considered an analog of other controlled DOx drugs like DOB, in which case, sales or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act. The drug's non-controlled status has made it usefully accessible for use in scientific research, which has contributed to its popularity for such uses.
In December 2023, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would classify both DOI and DOC as schedule I controlled substances. However, in May 2024, it was reported that the DEA's June 10, 2024 hearing on scheduling of DOI and DOC had been postponed. This followed opposition to the proposal by psychedelic researchers. DOI is frequently used in scientific research due in considerable part to its non-scheduled status, and DOI becoming a controlled substance would cause problems for scientists. In any case, an administrative judge recommended placement of DOI into Schedule I in June 2025, and it is likely that the drug will be scheduled.
DOI is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida.
