## Subjective Experience

5-MEO-DIBF appeared on the market early in 2015, and was greeted fairly positively,
although my own impression was more muted than most. I wrote the following
comment on a forum at the time:

\`\`\`
This delivered a psychedelic headspace, with a mild tactile tingly hornability
feel. Urge to redose? It is difficult to say as this was always going to be a
short gig, but I felt no real compulsion. I'm not sure where the estimates of a
nine hour duration came from, as I seem to be floating down after just four.
This was decent enough, and I enjoyed it more than most other recent
releases. However, this isn’t saying much.
\`\`\`
The last sentence of this probably sums it up quite well. On each occasion it created a
general headspace, but other than this, did not appear to be remarkable or
particularly interesting. In fairness, this equally applies to the other 5-meo
compounds I have sampled.

Note that there were a few safety warnings in circulation at the time of testing, so
caution is advised, certainly with respect to larger doses. Given my less than
enthralling experiences and the doubts cast by these, I binned my remaining supply.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 20 mg
- Light: 50 - 80 mg
- Common: 80 - 110 mg
- Strong: 110 - 140 mg
- Heavy: 140 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 6 hours
- Peak: 30 - 60 minutes

**5-Methoxy-N,N-diisopropylbenzofuranethylamine** (also known as **5-MeO-DiBF** ) is a novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is related in structure to [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

This compound has little to no history of human usage prior to its September 2015 release on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 5-MeO-DiBF. Due to its extreme novelty and unknown toxicity profile, it is highly advised that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-DiBF, or 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropylbenzofuranethylamine, is a synthetic heterocyclic alkaloid molecule of the [benzofuran](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzofuran) class. Benzofuran is a bicyclic structure formed by the fusion of a benzene ring and a furan ring, a five member aromatic ring containing an oxygen substituent.

5-MeO-DiBF is composed of a benzofuran group attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. It is substituted at R 5 of the benzofuran heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains two isopropyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (DiBF).

The benzofuran group of 5-MeO-DiBF is closely related in structure to the indole found in tryptamines; benzofuran contains an oxygen group at the same location that indole contains a nitrogen. As such, 5-MeO-DiBF is closely related in structure to the psychedelic tryptamine [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . 5-MeO-DiBF is the benzofuran analogue of [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) .

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-DiBF likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT2 family of serotonin receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

This compound is several times less potent as a serotonin agonist than 5-MeO-DiPT. It has relatively more activity at 5-HT1A, but still shows strongest effects at the 5-HT2 family of receptors.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 5-MeO-DiBF can be described as a motionless, constant, sharp and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the come up and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is particularly mild compared to other psychedelics.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**

- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as simplistic, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 5-MeO-DiBF is described by many as one which is both insightful and relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. The total sum of these cognitive components (regardless of the setting) generally includes: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 5-MeO-DiBF](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_5MeODiBF.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 5-MeO-DiBF use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-DiBF is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 5-MeO-DiBF suggest that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-DiBF is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-DiBF is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-DiBF presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-DiBF all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 5-MeO-DiBF. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

5-MeO-DiBF is currently thought to be a legal grey area substace in many parts of the world. However, although it is easily accessible through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors, this does not guarantee anyone to be immune from legal prosecution should they be found in possession of this substance as the legality is likely to vary from country to country.

- **Germany** : 5-MeO-DiBF is controlled under the NpSG (New Psychoactive Substances Act) as of November 26, 2016. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Switzerland** : 5-MeO-DiBF is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom** : It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.

5-MeO-DiBF is a psychedelic that has been sold online as a designer drug and was first definitively identified in December 2015 by a forensic laboratory in Slovenia. It is thought to act as an agonist for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 family of serotonin receptors. It is related in structure to the psychedelic tryptamine derivative 5-MeO-DiPT, but with the indole nitrogen replaced by oxygen, making 5-MeO-DiBF a benzofuran derivative. It is several times less potent as a serotonin agonist than 5-MeO-DiPT and with relatively more activity at 5-HT1A, but still shows strongest effects at the 5-HT2 family of receptors.

## Legal status

5-MeO-DiBF is not controlled under the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, so thus it has a legal grey area in many countries, but it's possible it could be illegal under so-called analogue acts if sold for human consumption.
