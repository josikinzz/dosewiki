# Baclofen
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/baclofen/*

Baclofen is a GABA-like drug that has been used for decades in the treatment of spasticity. It has muscle relaxant, anxiolytic, and sedative properties.

Outside of its medical use for spasticity, it has been researched as a possible treatment for alcohol dependence.

The drug is sometimes taken in non-medical settings because it can provide anxiety reduction, sedation, and some euphoria. It’s usually described as somewhat similar to phenibut in its effects.
