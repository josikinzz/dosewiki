**3-MeO-2′-Oxo-PCiPr** (also known as **MXiPr** ) is a novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class. It is a structural analog of [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . The mechanism of action is not known, but it is likely an NMDA [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) , producing [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) effects.

The circumstances surrounding MXiPr's origins are not known. It first appeared on the online research chemical market in late 2020 and was specifically marketed as a legal substitute for [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) or [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . The initial batch reportedly smelled like plastic and was suspected of containing impurities. The second batch contained a distinctly different smell of "pokemon cards".

Its [subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) are comparable to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) and [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) and include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [dissociation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disconnective_effects) . Its subjective effects are described as mostly similar to [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) or MXE, but being more unpredictable and euphoric which makes it further away from ketamine effects-wise. It is presumed to be a strong serotonin reuptake inhibitor like MXE.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MXiPr, and it has a very brief history of human usage. Given the reports of impure batches, it is advised to purify this substance (please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXiPr#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) and send it into a chemical testing service before use.

It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

MXiPr first appeared for sale on the online research chemical market in late 2020.

## Chemistry

MXiPr, or (IUPAC) 2-(3-Methoxyphenyl)-2-[(propan-2-yl)amino]cyclohexan-1-one, is classed as an [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) drug. It posesses an isopropyl group on the nitrogen atom of the molecule as well as a doubled-bonded oxygen atom at the 2' position of the cyclohexyl ring and a methoxy group on the 3 position of the phenyl ring, both of which it shares with [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) .

## Pharmacology

Very little is known about the pharmacology about this substance, however as an arylcyclohexamine it is reasonable to assume that it is an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually an almost identical equivalent of the famous “ [k-hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole) .”

Given its structural similarity to [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) and according to anecdotal reports, this substance may be a strong serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI). One should avoid combining MXiPr with other drugs that act on serotonin.

## Subjective effects

Early anecdotal reports suggest that MXiPr exhibits two plateaus: The first plateau occurs at doses around 5-20 mg and produces a two hour long experience resembling nitrous oxide, the second plateau occurs at doses around 20-40+ mg giving an experience similar to a [hole](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids) , but generally considered chaotic, with a remarkably warmer or "dreamier" afterglow which can also become very euphoric. Some researchers urge caution when experimenting with higher doses. There are reports of body load occurring for up to 2 days after a small dose and seizures at very high dosages.

MXiPr shares similar properties to that of [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) and [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) but there have been some anecdotal reports that suggest that this may have a potentially higher risk of inducing [Rhabdomyolysis (Wikipedia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhabdomyolysis) , [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] seizures, and amnesia. It is possible that these effects may be avoided by practicing harm reduction via keeping dosages low, infrequent usage, and avoiding combinations.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - At low to moderate dosages, MXiPr is primarily stimulating while at higher dosages the experience turns sedating.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The MXiPr "body high" can be described as a sharp, pleasurable tingling sensation which is location specific to the hands, feet, and head.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is very prevalent with MXiPr and strangely stimulating. It encourages physical activities at low to moderate doses by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - A loss of gross and fine motor control alongside balance and coordination is prevalent on MXiPr and becomes especially strong at higher doses. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset (unless experienced) in the case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - This partially to entirely suppresses one's sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anesthetic properties of this substance.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Although uncommon, some people report dizziness under the influence of MXiPr, especially when used in combination with other substances.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - High dose MXiPr experience can sometimes result in nausea and vomiting at the peak of the trip. For most people, this is surprisingly not as unpleasant as they would initially expect due to the accompanying detachment from the physical senses.
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)**
- **[Orgasm suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_suppression)** & **[Orgasm enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orgasm_enhancement)** - Orgasm enhancement can sometimes also be present, even at higher doses, although this effect is not reliable.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This effect is typically present at the higher doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - This effect has been reported as being more pronounced than other dissociatives, such as [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) or [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - The extent to which this effect can be produced is unknown, but it appears the likelihood of this is more pronounced than other dissociatives, and can probably be avoided by keeping dosage within reasonable levels. The likelihood is also probably increased in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)** or **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - While lower doses of this compound tend to produce mild visual acuity enhancements, this effect quickly disappears as one's general visual faculties become suppressed as the dose is increased.
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Perspective distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_distortions)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Environmental cubism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)**
- **[Environmental orbism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_orbism)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* , *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* )
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, fixed in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The euphoria of this substance is reported to be stronger than that of other dissociatives like [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) but weaker than that of [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**

- **[Mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania)** - Some users have reported mania on this substance. The frequency of which is undetermined. It is strongly recommended to use harm-reduction practices and not use this substance in high amounts or frequently. Most likely, it is more common than most [arylcyclohexylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamines) but less common in occurrence compared to [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) and [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) .
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)** & **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)** - Most likely, this effect is more common with MXiPr than with most other [arylcyclohexylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamines) but less common in occurrence compared to substances like 3-MeO-PCP.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**

- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This is reported to be present at lower dosage ranges. ### Auditory effects
 
- The auditory effects of MXiPr have been described as more pronounced than other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . These effects include: 
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - These distortions are very powerful and loud enough in their volume to make the original sound completely unrecognizable. They include phasers, white noise, high pitch tones and notes, flanging, changes in pitch, echo effects, and stuttering. In particular, the frequency of the stuttering is proportionally related to the intensity of the effects, especially ego death which occurs when the stuttering becomes continuous.
- **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a muffling and quieting of externally sourced sound which results in it sounding more indistinct and distant than it would usually be. ### Disconnective effects
 
- - **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in MXiPr's equivalent of the " [k-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole) " or, more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)* .
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MXiPr](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MXiPr.shtml)
- [Reddit: MXiPr consistently gives seizures at higher dosages administered IM](https://www.reddit.com/r/researchchemicals/comments/la97rf/mxipr_consistently_gives_seizures_at_higher/)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MXiPr use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because MXiPr has very little history of human usage.

MXiPr has anecdotally been reported to produce seizures at very high dosages.

If one suspects that it may be impure and are still keen on taking this substance, using an oral [route of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) may process the impurities though first-pass metabolism.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other NMDA receptor antagonists, the chronic use of MXiPr can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of producing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if one suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MXiPr develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects.

After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

MXiPr exhibits cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the consumption of MXiPr all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) will have a reduced effect.

### Urinary tract effects

Regarding its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and over excessive periods, MXiPr is suspected to exhibit similar bladder and urinary tract problems found with [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , but to a lesser extent. This is because MXiPr is far more potent than ketamine, so significantly less of substance needs to be consumed. Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become severe and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, especially since the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using MXiPr on a daily or even weekly basis and consciously limiting one's usage of the substance.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

## Legal status

- **Germany:** MXiPr is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.

- **Hungary:** MXiPr was made illegal to possess, produce and sell in Hungary in April 2021.

MXiPr (Methoxisopropamine, Isopropyloxetamine, Isopropyxetamine') is a recreational designer drug with dissociative effects. It is an arylcyclohexylamine derivative, related to drugs such as ketamine and methoxetamine. It is an N-ethyl homologue to methoxetamine. Since it hasn't been extensively studied, the pharmacological effects are unclear, but its effects are reportedly similar to methoxetamine. It was first identified in Slovenia in December 2020, and was made illegal in Hungary in April 2021.
