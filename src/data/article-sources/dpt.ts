DPT Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
DPT is a synthetic tryptamine most similar in nature to DMT. It is weakly active orally, and active inhaled, insufflated, and IM. It is most often found in powder form. The charts below shows general dosages guidelines for DPT in milligrams (mg) with 4 different delivery routes...oral, insufflated (snorted), IM (intra-muscular), and inhaled (smoked/vaporized freebase oil). Even more than other tryptamines, DPT seems to have a wide range of effects at any particular dose, depending on the individual. This is reflected somewhat in the following ranges of dosages.

## SYNTHESIS
(from indole) To a well stirred solution of 10 g indole in 150 mL anhydrous Et2O there was added, dropwise over the course of 30 min, a solution of 11 g oxalyl chloride in 150 mL anhydrous Et2O. Stirring was continued for an additional 15 min during which time there was the separation of indol-3-ylglyoxyl chloride. This intermediate was removed by filtration and used directly in the following step. This was added, in small increments, to 20 mL anhydrous dipropylamine which was being stirred. There was then added an excess of 2 N HCl, the mixture cooled, and the resulting solids removed by filtration. These were recrystallized from aqueous EtOH to give, after air drying, 13.2 g indol-3-yl N,N-dipropylglyoxylamide with a mp 95â96 Â°C. A solution of 13 g indol-3-yl N,N-dipropylglyoxylamide in 350 mL anhydrous dioxane was added, slowly, to 19 g LAH in 350 mL dioxane which was well stirred and held at reflux temperature under an inert atmosphere. After the addition was complete, refluxing was maintained for an additional 16 h, the reaction mixture cooled, and the excess hydride destroyed by the cautious addition of wet dioxane. The formed solids were removed by filtration, washed with hot dioxane, the filtrate and washings combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The brownish residue was dissolved in anhydrous Et2O and saturated with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. The resulting crystals were recrystallized from benzene/methanol to give 11.9 g of N,N-dipropyltryptamine hydrochloride (DPT) with a mp of 178â179 Â°C and an overall yield of 49%.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 250 mg, orally) âI was seeing the Light real strongly. The Light sort of looked like bright bursts of Light but also like a kind of Spiritual Tunnel, and it seemed at one point, along with that, I saw a Human form, but the Vision seemed like I was sort of inside the Being and outside, and the Human was inside me and appeared to be outside, but I didnât see the beingâs face or clearly see the various limbs because the Being seemed to be the tunnel of Light that I was inside in the Vision, and seemed much larger than me. As King Jesus said: (St. John 6,56) âWhoever eats my Flesh and drinks my Blood lives in me and I live in them.ââ

(with 275 mg, orally) âI have smoked this amount one time some while ago, and this is a lot more interesting. And a lot more intense. With smoking, there was a body rush that was uncomfortable, and you never really know how much went into you, what with pyrolysis and all.â

(with 500 mg, orally) âThis was intensely visual, and it lasted an exhausting 12 hours. I prefer the smoking route.â

(with 100 mg, smoked) âThe entire experience lasted only 20 minutes. I found the visual experience to be everything. It was a lot more benign than mushrooms with pretty much no toxic things, more like mescaline.â

(with many mg, smoked) âI saw this vision of two hearts rotating. They were shaped like the usual heart shape (like a valentine). They filled most of my vision and were rotating one inside the other. Around the outside of the hearts there were sparkling jewels or crystals of light of different colors, maybe four rows deep surrounding them all around. This vision was totally clear. When I saw this vision, time was very full and long and complete.â

(with 80 mg, intramuscularly i.m.) âI feel light and nervous. Iâm way off in a big castle with beautiful colors and scenery. Iâm back with the girl who accused me of fathering her child. Itâs peaceful. She had everything she wanted. My aunt made sure we went to church on Sunday. I see the devil in front of my face. Everything is going fast. Too fast. Itâs not pleasant. Things are going zig-zag. Feels like Iâm tired. I feel like an old man in a rocking chair sitting in front of a phonograph. Everything is so mixed up. Iâm trying to get myself together. I have a vibrating feeling. It makes me feel as though Iâm not here.â

(with 100 mg, intramuscularly i.m.) âI was being led by the hand of a wise old man who I know was God, and we went of to the front of the synagogue. I was handed a Torah for me to carry as a sign that I had been accepted, and forgiven, and that I had come home.â

(with 12 mg, intravenously i.v.) âWe were using an i.v. drip with sodium ascorbate which affected the timing, of course. This was strong at this level. I was set to go to a target dosage of 60 milligrams, but decided to stop at 12. It was strong, real strong.â

(with 36 mg, intravenously i.v.) âThis was administered as a sterile solution of the fumarate salt, so the actual weight of the drug used is somewhat less. This was a very intense experience, every bit as powerful as this amount of DMT.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Studies using lower dosages of DPT (15â30 mg intramuscularly) have been explored as adjuncts to psychotherapy with alcoholic patients. The enhancement of recall of memories and experiences, the greater emotional expressiveness expressivenes and self-exploration, coupled with a consistently short duration, made the drug very attractive. Higher doses, up in the 100 milligram range, have been explored in psychotherapy, in the quest for peak experiences. Yet another study, in exploring the interaction of therapy counseling and DPT-induced peak experiences with patients who are dying, the intramuscularly i.m. dosage range was between 75 and 125 milligrams.

There is a rather remarkable religious group known as the Temple of the True Inner Light, in New York City, which has embraced as its Eucharist DPT which they refer to as a powerful Angel of the Host. Their communion is confirmed by either the smoking or the drinking of the sacrament, and they have been totally unbothered by any agency of the Federal Government, as far as I know. It is not as if they were unknown. Quite on the contrary, I had on one occasion received a request for information on the drug from a reporter who was writing a story on DPT and its use in the church. I asked him just how he had gotten my name, and he told me that he was given it by someone within the DEA. Someone, sometime, should write an essay on contemporary religions, as to why DPT has flown, why peyote forever struggles, and LSD and marijuana have bombed out, when tied to religion. Is there something about a faith being an âapprovedâ religion? Who gives his approval? Who decides the applicability of the first amendment which explicitly states that, âCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.â

I wish the True Inner Light congregation Godspeed, if you will excuse the expression. My impressions of them from our correspondence have left me totally convinced of their integrity and dedication. It is an intriguing fact that this tryptamine was commercially available for a while from at least one small independent supplier of chemical novelties, but I believe that this is now no longer a valid source.

An intriguing (and perhaps theoretical) homologue of DPT is the 1-propyl counterpart, 1,N,N-tripropyltryptamine, referred to as PDPT. It is claimed that simply reacting tryptamine with an excess of propyl bromide put an alkyl group on the indolic 1-position (as stated also for the ethyl counterpart, sometimes referred to as EDET). In my own experiments with this reaction, I have yet to see any suggestion of 1-alkylation.

The homologue with only one propyl group on the nitrogen, N-propyltryptamine or NPT, has been made according to the same recipe, and is discussed under NET.

**N,N-Dipropyltryptamine** (also known as **Dipropyltryptamine** , **DPT** , and **"The Light"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is closely related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and is reported to be uniquely similar in its hallucinogenic intensity, albeit with a moderately longer duration and greater unpredictability relative to DMT and other psychedelic tryptamines.

DPT was first synthesized in 1950. Human use was first reported in 1973, where it was researched in low doses as an adjunct to therapy for alcoholism. It has also been researched in high doses to induce peak experiences for terminal cancer patients. It has gained some notoriety for its adoption as the primary sacrament for the "Temple of the True Inner Light" in the United States, a Christian off-shoot organization who believe in the ritual use of [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and refer to them as "the true flesh of God."

DPT is commonly consumed via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) or [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) . Many report the experience of insufflation to be very congestive and painful which, with the rapidness of onset, does not give the user much time to acclimate themselves to its powerful effects. It can also be administered [intramuscularly](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Intramuscular) or via [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporization) after conversion to the freebase form. Smoking the freebase is reported to be the preferred route used by the "Temple of True Inner Light". More experienced members ingest a DPT tea. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DPT, and it has relatively little history of human usage. It has long been available on the [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) market as a legal, grey-market alternative to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , and commercially distributed through online vendors. Many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already very experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to approach this powerful [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) when using it.

## Chemistry

DPT, or N,N-dipropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DPT contains two propyl groups carbon chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone.

DPT has a number of substituted analogs such as [4-HO-DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DPT) or [4-AcO-DPT](/w/index.php?title=4-AcO-DPT&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT 2A receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist also imply a 5-HT 1A -mediated component to the actions of DPT. The role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

Relative to psychedelic tryptamines like DMT, DPT is often reported to be similar in its [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) intensity, albeit with a moderately longer duration and more challenging effects. DPT experiences are often described as a "bizarre", "unsettling", and "darker" version of DMT experiences. DPT is reported to be more sensual and physical than DMT and other psychedelics with a corresponding amount of adverse physical effects.

At light to moderate doses, users often report a slight sense of anaesthetization and relaxation. As the dose increases, hyper-awareness of one's heart rate and breathing increases and body tremors and loss of muscle control are often reported. The effects of DPT can range from strong euphoria and sensuality to nausea, panic, and intense states dysphoria even within the same experience.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DPT is generally more prominent to that of the better known [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . There is often the sensation of limbs feeling disconnected from the body, a force pinning the body to the surface on which it lay and body tremors which can often make the user feel aware of but not in control of their body. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)**
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)** - At higher doses, physical feelings of moving through spaces at quick speeds or being completely pinned down are common.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This effect appears to occur with more regularity and intensity than other psychedelic tryptamines. ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
DPT visual geometry can be described through its variations as intricate in complexity, both abstract and concrete in form, more digital than organic in feel, choppy and only loosely structured in organization, brightly lit, multicolored in scheme, sharp in its edges, fast in speed, simultaneously smooth and glitching in motion, immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity. At higher doses, it is more likely to result in states of [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) over level 8B.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used psychedelic barring [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [ibogaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ibogaine) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - These are reported to be more common with DPT than with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which lends to its common description as feeling more "industrial" and futuristic, while [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) visuals can often be described as "ancient" or "earthy" in feel.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - As with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , DPT produces high level internal hallucinations at appropriate doses more consistently than most other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, non-autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental narrative in their overall theme, with a tendency towards chaotic disorganization and incoherence.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, non-autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and typically of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental narrative in their overall theme, with a tendency towards chaotic disorganization and incoherence. ### Cognitive effects

- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Many reports indicate that while DPT possesses the raw [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) power to induce transpersonal states traditionally associated with "classical psychedelics", it does so in a significantly less consistent fashion due to the utter bizarreness and oft-noted "sinister", chaotic, or "forceful" undertones that can be present throughout the experience. What insights it can lead the user to typically occur during the aftermath and integration phase that follows, which shares some qualities of a typical near-death experience.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DPT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. There has been one death associated with the use DPT and seizures, but the dose is unknown.

Anecdotal reports from those who have taken DPT suggests that negative health effects are not likely to occur from simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it sparingly (although nothing can be guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. As with most psychedelics, it is reported to be self-limiting.

Tolerance to the effects of DPT has been shown to not be built in animal models. However, it has been reported to be able to build slightly relative to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , although still to an insignificant degree compared to most psychedelics.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and LSD also has the potential to induce seizures in susceptible individuals. and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is often used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It may possibly cause elevated risk of seizures and psychosis due to its [glutaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

DPT is a psychedelic tryptamine that can be as intense as DMT and 5-MeO-DMT with its peak effects. It’s historically been less common than both, possibly because its effects are less comfortable for many users, particularly compared to DMT.

Far less is known about the drug and it’s not clear how safe it is. More negative physical effects appear to exist with it relative to DMT.

It was briefly tested in therapy settings during the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings were promising.

PubChem: 6091

Molecular formula: C16H24N2

Molecular weight: 244.382 g/mol

IUPAC: N-[2-(1H-indol-3-yl)ethyl]-N-propylpropan-1-amine

---

## Dose

#### Oral

- Light: 50 – 125 mg
- Common: 125 – 250 mg
- Strong: 250+ mg

#### Intranasal

- Light: 5 – 20 mg
- Common: 20 – 100 mg
- Strong: 100+ mg

#### Inhalation

- Light: 10 – 20 mg
- Common: 20 – 50 mg
- Strong: 50 – 100+ mg

#### Intramuscular

- Light: 10 – 20 mg
- Common: 20 – 60 mg
- Strong: 60 – 100+ mg

Dosing is complicated by the fact that individual users can respond in very different ways to DPT. It’s possible for a low-common dose to produce very strong effects. You should always start with a light dose and work up slowly.

It’s even more complicated with oral dosing, which sometimes doesn’t yield any notable effects in the absence of an MAOI.

DPT is primarily taken via inhalation, intranasal, and intramuscular.

---

## Timeline

#### Oral

- Total: 2 – 4 hours
- Onset: 00:20 – 01:00

#### Intranasal

- Total: 3 – 4 hours
- Onset: 00:05 – 00:15

#### Inhalation

- Total: 30 – 60 minutes
- Onset: Under 2 minutes

#### Intramuscular

- Total: 3 -4 hours
- Onset: 00:02 – 00:10

The duration appears to reliably extend (to a point) as the dose increases. I’ve listed the average common dose durations.

## Experience Reports

## Effects

#### Positive

- CEVs and OEVs
- Auditory hallucinations
- Music enhancement
- Stimulation
- Euphoria
- Relaxation

#### Negative

- Paranoia
- Psychosis
- Anxiety
- Nausea
- Dizziness
- Increased heart rate
- Tremor

The core effects at common to strong doses can be very intense and all-encompassing. Dissociative experiences in which the user becomes temporarily separated from reality have been reported. The details of each “breakthrough” or full psychedelic experience vary between users.

A lot of users find it’s more psychologically difficult than other psychedelics. This isn’t true for everyone, but it is less pleasant on average.

When the full effects are present, it may be essentially impossible to operate in the real world. Some users report being unable to move and even if they’re aware of their surroundings, the visuals and other effects can make the experience severely disorienting.

Interestingly, some users have reported very visual experiences without negative physical effects or any psychological impairment/distress.

#### Dose-response

Light doses primarily lead to a somewhat altered psychological state and minor visuals. The psychological changes may include greater emotional fluctuation and memory recall. Some users report having an internal “self-exploratory” experience at this dose.

Once the dose moves into the low-common range, the visuals intensify. It’s common for the negative physical effects to become more prominent, such as sweating, perceived tachycardia, and nausea. Movement might be difficult.

The more complete effects develop somewhere in the common range. That exact point varies by user and between uses. Users report it is harder to attain a full breakthrough or strong psychedelic experience when taking it orally.

All-encompassing experiences more readily develop with eyes closed. This matters less with sufficiently high doses. Those experiences may include seeing one’s memories, feeling as though you’re dead, feeling like you’re flying through space, or encountering entities. Spiritual experiences can occur, though they’re not guaranteed.

One example of a strong experience comes from a cancer patient study completed in the 1970s. A woman said she felt like she was “led by the hand of a wise old man she called God to the front of the sanctuary, and there given a Torah to carry as a sign that she was accepted, forgiven, and had ‘come home.'”

On average, the effects are more confusing and less pleasant than with DMT. That being said, they span the full range from amazing and wonderful to depressing and terrifying.

Its visual effects can be very complex and even freestanding hallucinations may develop.

#### Medical/therapy

A few trials were completed to see if could be useful as a therapeutic agent for cancer patients and alcohol addicts.

**Addiction**

One study in addicts with 15 to 30 mg found the drug produced a more productive/beneficial psychological state than placebo. They rated the effects higher on scales for self-exploration, intensity of feeling, emotional expressiveness, and recall of memories.

This test didn’t actually look at its impact on addiction. However, the conclusion was that those psychological effects at relatively low doses could aid in therapy.

A study examining the potential anti-addiction effects involved 51 people. A mean of 1.9 sessions with DPT were provided, with a range of 1 to 6 sessions. There were significant improvements in therapeutic outcomes (including abstinence) among 47 (92%).

When the same effects were investigated in a randomized trial comparing DPT-assisted psychotherapy to regular psychotherapy or regular hospital treatment, the efficacy changed.

DPT initially seemed to offer superior outcomes, but the difference disappeared by 6 months. The regular psychotherapy group actually had better drinking outcomes and social functioning than the other two groups.

More research is clearly needed to fully investigate this use for the drug.

#### Cancer-related psychological status

A study examined its ability to serve as an alternative to LSD. The researchers hoped to find a useful psychedelic with a shorter duration.

Psychotherapy was provided before and after the session. The therapists also helped to assure participants during the drug session. Users were given eyeshades and headphones to wear.

During this trial, the mean dose was 101.7 mg intramuscular (75 to 127.5 mg). Effects developed in 2-3 minutes and lasted for 2.5 to 4 hours. Unlike with LSD, it was found the effects abruptly terminated, suddenly leaving participants essentially back to baseline.

Therapists believed the participants exhibited lower psychological distress after the session and there were lower depression/anxiety scores. Greater improvement was seen on self-reported measures.

As we’ve seen in other psychedelic studies, “mystical” experiences were considered potentially useful in the therapeutic action.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

DPT is a synthetic tryptamine that’s similar in structure to DMT. It differs from DMT in that two propyl groups have replaced DMT’s methyl groups.

#### Pharmacology

Not as much research has been conducted on it relative to other psychedelics. However, we have some understanding of its activity based on its effects and formal research.

5-HT2a agonism is present, likely in addition to 5-HT1A partial agonism. Some pieces of evidence had pointed towards antagonism, but that doesn’t seem accurate.

Other serotonin and non-serotonin receptors could potentially be involved.

In discriminative stimulus tests using rats, it fully substitutes for DOM. The DOM-like stimulus can be blocked by a selective 5-HT2a antagonist.

---

## History

#### 1950s

It appears the drug was synthesized sometime in the 1950s and it was first tested in dogs in 1954.

#### 1960s – 1970s

Tests in humans during the 1960s confirmed its psychedelic/hallucinogenic action. A handful of trials were conducted to see if it may be a useful drug in therapy settings.

Some of the trials, which were mainly conducted in cancer patients and alcohol addicts, involved Stan Grof. Even though the results were somewhat promising, not enough research was done to come to any conclusions.

The work in cancer patients was covered in a CBS 60 Minutes piece in the late 1970s.

Research of this kind ended by 1980.

#### 1980s – 1990s

Some use began to be reported, much of which was connected to the Temple of the True Inner Light, a group based in New York. They were using DPT for spiritual purposes and they took it via inhalation or oral.

Use outside of this group is poorly documented and was probably rare. It’s never been a top psychedelic, despite its legal status.

#### 2005

The DEA reported a rise in the number of DPT samples being sent to labs in the US. DPT was showing up with greater frequency, just like 5-MeO-DiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-AMT, and 5-MeO-DMT.

#### 2000s

Research into its pharmacology confirmed its activity at serotonin receptors.

#### 2016

It is still available from some online research chemical companies and often isn’t illegal. Nevertheless, it continues to be a pretty uncommon psychedelic.

---

## Legal Status

#### US (as of December 2016)

Federally unscheduled.

It is controlled in Florida and Maine.

#### Controlled (list may not be complete)

Belgium, Greece, Latvia, Japan, Sweden, and the UK.

---

## Safety

Not much is known about its safety, but it doesn’t appear common doses would be physically dangerous acutely in a healthy person. It’s best to take it at common doses, infrequently, and without combinations.

There are no fatalities on record in connection with the substance. While one alleged death did occur in Minnesota in 2015, the role of DPT was not confirmed.

Psychological concerns do exist and there’s some potential for temporary psychosis. Transient anxiety and paranoia are more common. Those with existing psychiatric disorders shouldn’t take the substance.

#### Risky combinations

- Stimulants
- Other hallucinogens
- Tramadol

  "wikipedia": `# Dipropyltryptamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipropyltryptamine*

Dipropyltryptamine (DPT), also known as N,N-dipropyltryptamine or as "The Light", is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is taken orally or by other routes.
The drug acts as a serotonin receptor modulator, including as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist. It is a close structural homologue of DMT and diethyltryptamine (DET). Derivatives of DPT include 4-HO-DPT and 5-MeO-DPT, among others.
DPT was first described in the literature by 1959. It was encountered as a novel designer drug by 1968 and was reported as a possible treatment for alcoholism in 1973. The drug is the sacrament of the Temple of the True Inner Light, a New York City-based religious group.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin lists DPT's dose range as 100 to 250 mg orally and its duration as 2 to 4 hours. A 500 mg dose was also reported, which was described as "exhausting" and as lasting 12 hours. The onset and time to peak effects were not given, but it was implied to have a fast onset. In addition to oral administration, DPT has been assessed by smoking at a dose of 100 mg, by intramuscular injection at low doses of 15 to 30 mg, moderate doses of 30 to 70 mg, and "peak experience" doses of 75 to 125 mg, and by intravenous injection at 12 to 36 mg.
The effects of DPT have been reported to include visuals, being intensely visual at high doses, changes in time perception, feeling like one is in a different place like on a mountain in clouds or in a big castle, enhanced recall of memories and experiences, enhanced emotional expressiveness and self-exploration, entity encounters, and religious feelings. Other effects included trouble talking, feeling uncomfortable, nervousness, feeling light, and body rush. Given at a high dose intravenously, it was described as every bit as powerful as a psychedelic as DMT. According to one account however, DPT and DMT, despite their chemical similarity, "reveal completely different worlds".
Other reports have stated effects of DPT including visual and auditory hallucinations, increased color intensity, flashes of light and sparkles, apparitions of faces, increased music appreciation, ego dissolution, stimulation, euphoria, relaxation, paranoia, psychosis, anxiety, nausea, dizziness, muscle tremors, and increased heart rate, among others. Its duration is described as much shorter than those of certain other psychedelics like LSD, which can be advantageous in a clinical setting. However, it is also said to have a rapid onset that can be psychologically overwhelming.

## Side effects

Although tryptamines such as psilocybin and dimethyltryptamine (DMT) have relatively well‑characterized safety, synthetic analogues like DPT lack thorough toxicological evaluation and are mainly associated with anecdotal reports of intoxication and a few cases of fatal outcomes when used recreationally. The pharmacological similarity of DPT to DMT suggests a generally low intrinsic toxicity at controlled doses but a pronounced risk of acute adverse reactions, including agitation, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and serotonergic crisis, particularly in combination with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other serotonergic substances.
A meta-analysis of tryptamine psychedelics have further demonstrated cognitive effects through serotonin 5-HT2A receptor modulation but have not identified persistent neurotoxicity. The main safety concerns are acute psychophysiological and behavioral disturbances rather than long‑term organ toxicity. Overall, DPT is a potent, short‑acting serotonergic hallucinogen with limited safety data and a toxicity profile comparable to related tryptamines such as DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

DPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic-like effects, in rodents. Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral actions of DPT strongly suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor is an important site of action for the drug, but the modulatory actions of a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist also imply a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor-mediated component to the actions of DPT. Unusually among most psychedelics, DiPT did not show evidence of behavioral tolerance in rodents.

## Chemistry

DPT, also known as N,N-dipropyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine related to dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is found either as a crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base. The drug is synthetic and has not been found to occur endogenously.

### Detection

DPT changes Ehrlich's reagent violet and causes the marquis reagent to turn yellow.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of DPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of DPT include dimethyltryptamine (DMT), diethyltryptamine (DET), diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), diallyltryptamine (DALT), methylethyltryptamine (MET), methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), ethylpropyltryptamine (EPT), propylisopropyltryptamine (PiPT), propylallyltryptamine (PALT), 4-HO-DPT, 5-HO-DPT, and 5-MeO-DPT, among others.

## History

DPT was first described in the scientific literature by 1959. Use of DPT as a designer drug has been documented by law enforcement officials since as early as 1968. It was described as a treatment for alcoholism by Stanislav Grof and colleagues in 1973. It was also studied for treatment of anxiety associated with terminal cancer in the late 1970s. However, it was not further studied for such purposes after 1980.

## Society and culture

### Religious use

DPT is used as a religious sacrament by the Temple of the True Inner Light, a New York City offshoot of the Native American Church. The Temple believes DPT and other entheogens are physical manifestations of God.

### Legal status

#### Sweden

DPT is illegal in Sweden as of 26 January 2016.

#### United Kingdom

DPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom, making it illegal to possess or distribute.

#### United States

DPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, DMT, or DET, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.

##### Florida

"DPT (N,N-Dipropyltryptamine)" is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida.

##### Maine

DPT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Maine making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Maine.

## Research

### Fragile X syndrome

DPT has been found to completely prevent audiogenic seizures in mouse models of fragile X syndrome (FXS) at a 10 mg/kg dose, with its mechanism of action appearing to be independent of serotonin and sigma σ1 receptor activation. While DPT is an agonist at several serotonin receptors in vitro, its anticonvulsant effects were not blocked by selective serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, or 5-HT1B receptor antagonists nor by a selective sigma σ1 receptor antagonist in vivo. The drug's beneficial effects may be mediated by non-serotonergic pathways, possibly involving direct auditory processing modulation. At higher doses, DPT switched from anticonvulsant to proconvulsant action, indicating complex interactions.
