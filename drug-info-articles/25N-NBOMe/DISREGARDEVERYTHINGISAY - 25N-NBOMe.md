**Many drugs in the NBOMe series have been fatal at heavy doses.^[1]^[2]^[3]** **It is strongly discouraged to take large amounts of this substance or to snort it. **

**25N-NBOMe** (**2C-N-NBOMe**) is a derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic 2C-N which was discovered in 2004 by Ralf Heim at the Free University of Berlin and subsequently investigated by a team at Purdue University led by David Nichols.^

25N-NBOMe has a notably shorter duration than the rest of the 25x-NBOMe series, with a total duration of 6 hours and a peak duration of 2 hours. It is moderately active at a 1mg dosage, and  2mg provides a strong/heavy trip. This substance is considerably less potent when compared to the more popular NBOMes such as 25B-NBOMe, 25I-NBOMe, and 25C-NBOMe, all of which lead to strong trips at 1mg+ doses.

In terms of its chemistry, 25N-NBOMe is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached to carbons R2 and R5 as well as a nitrophenyl group attached to carbon R4. It differs from 2C-N structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-methoxybenzyl (BOMe) group, which in turn increases potency about a hundred fold.

In terms of its pharmacology, 25N-NBOMe has efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor where it is assumed to act as a partial agonist. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive. There is insufficient scientific research to determine this compound’s true nature as the pharmacological properties of 25N-NBOMe have not been described in the literature but only in anecdotal reports. 25N-NBOMe has been sold as a street drug and has only been described in the literature in terms of identification by forensic analysis.^

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki#Contributors). The listed effects will rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 25N-NBOMe can be broken down into seven components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- [Wakefulness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)
- [Stimulation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) - In terms of its effects on the energy levels of the tripper, 25N-NBOMe is quite stimulating, and leftover stimulation can linger up to 10 hours even after the trip subsides.
- [Vasoconstriction](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)
- [Tactile enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement) - 25N-NBOMe increases tactile sensory input and feedback which intensifies tactile comfort and discomfort as well as pleasure and pain.
- [Bodily control enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement) - The drug increases muscle and bodily control.
- [Runny nose](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Runny_nose) - 25N-NBOMe may cause a runny nose and increased mucus production in some users.
- [Nausea](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) - Users (especially those prone to it) may experience nausea during the onset. The nausea will subside over the peak.

**Cognitive effects:**** **

The cognitive effects of 25N-NBOMe can be described as quite reminiscent to that of 25C-NBOMe’s effects. They can be broken down into nine components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- [Time distortion](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)
- [Introspection](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)
- [Conceptual thinking](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)
- [Thought connectivity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)
- [Feelings of self-design](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_self-design)
- [Novelty enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)
- [Cognitive euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)
- [Laughter](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter) - There is an increased proneness to laughter and joy at moderate and heavier doses.
- [Disinhibition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) -

**Visual effects:**

**[Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Enhancements)**

- [Visual acuity enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)
- [Colour enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**

****[Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Distortions)****

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition) **
- [3-Dimensional textures](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-Dimensional_textures) - At moderate and heavier doses, the textures will become 3-dimensional or appear to float/drift through space/air.
- [Drifting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting) *(*[Melting](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting)*, *[Flowing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing)*, *[Breathing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing)* and *[morphing](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#_morphing)*)* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.

****[Geometry](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics#Geometry)****

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip is often described as similar in appearance to that of LSD. They can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, sharp around the edges and mostly rounded across their corners.

In terms of its behaviour, 25N-NBOMe’s geometry leads onto [Level 8A](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [Level 8B](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) remaining so far unconfirmed within this substance. They also seem to consistently build up in visual intensity when the tripper stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.

**Hallucinatory states**

- [Transformations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)
- [Internal hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) ([Autonomous entities](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities), [Settings, sceneries, and landscapes](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes), [Alterations in perspective](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alterations_in_perspective) and [Scenarios and plots](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)) - 25N-NBOMe is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. Level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported, but very uncommon and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as psilocin, 2C-E and DMT. This effect is more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and of no particular theme in their content or style.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 25B-NBOMe are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly includes:

- [Enhancements](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)
- [Distortions](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)
- [Hallucinations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)

**Physical health effects, potential addiction and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 25N-NBOMe use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 25N-NBOMe is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychedelic community who have tried 25N-NBOMe suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Users should be very careful and consider that ingesting 2mg+ of NBOMe series chemicals have proven fatal in some cases. Although there are no reported fatalities caused by 25N-NBOMe at this time, it is a rare research chemical.

In terms of its addictive potential, 25N-NBOMe has not been studied formally, but due to its immediate tolerance build up, which lasts up to 2 - 3 weeks after the experience, it is difficult to use this substance compulsively.

**Legal issues:**

- **Brazil:** The possession, production and sale is illegal.
- USA: 25N-NBOMe is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analog of 2C-N (which is a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act). As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analog Act.
- UK: On 10 June 2014, all NBOMes became
 Class A drugs which means that they’re illegal to have, give away or 
sell. Possession could get one up to seven years in jail and/or an 
unlimited fine. Supplying someone else could result in a heavy jail time
 sentence between a minimum of eight years and a life sentence and/or an
 unlimited fine.
