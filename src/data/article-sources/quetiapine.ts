## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dibenzothiazepines. These are compounds containing a dibenzothiazepine moiety, which consists of two benzene connected by a thiazepine ring.

### Background

Initially approved by the FDA in 1997, quetiapine is a second-generation atypical antipsychotic used in schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder.
19
Quetiapine demonstrates a high level of therapeutic efficacy and low risk of adverse effects during long-term treatment. It is well-tolerated and a suitable option for some patients with high sensitivity to other drugs, such as
clozapine
and
olanzapine
.
1

### Indication

Quetiapine is used in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia.  In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. It may be used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression.
19
Some off-label uses for this drug include the management of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease.

### Pharmacodynamics

Quetiapine improves the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and major depression by acting on various neurotransmitter receptors, such as the serotonin and dopamine receptors. In bipolar disorder, it improves both depressive and manic symptoms.

A note on suicidality in young patients and administration in the elderly
Quetiapine can cause suicidal thinking or behavior in children and adolescents and should not be given to children under 10 years of age. It is important to monitor for suicidality if this drug is given to younger patients. In addition, this drug is not indicated for the treatment of psychosis related to dementia due to an increased death rate in elderly patients taking this drug.
19

### Mechanism of Action

5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A
Antagonist
D(2) dopamine receptor
Antagonist

### Absorption

Quetiapine is rapidly and well absorbed after administration of an oral dose.
21
Steady-state is achieved within 48 hours
15
and peak plasma concentrations are achieved within 1.5 hours.
21
The steady-state Cmax of quetiapine in Han Chinese patients with schizophrenia after a 300 mg oral dose of the extended released formulation was approximately 467 ng/mL and the AUC at steady-state was 5094 ng·h/mL.
17
While the absolute bioavailability has not been fully elucidated and is reported to be low,
5
the tablet formulation is 100% bioavailable relative to solution.
21
Absorption of quetiapine is affected by food, with Cmax increased by 25% and AUC increased by 15%.
21

### Metabolism

The metabolism of quetiapine occurs mainly in the liver. Sulfoxidation and oxidation are the main metabolic pathways of this drug. According to in vitro studies, cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolizes quetiapine to an inactive sulfoxide metabolite and also participates in the metabolism of its active metabolite, N-desalkyl quetiapine. CYP2D6 also regulates the metabolism of quetiapine. In one study, three metabolites of N-desalkylquetiapine were identified. Two of the metabolites were identified as N-desalkylquetiapine sulfoxide and 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine. CYP2D6 has been found to be responsible for metabolism of quetiapine to 7-hydroxy-N-desalkylquetiapine, a pharmacologically active metabolite. Individual differences in CYP2D6 metabolism may be present, which may affect the concentrations of the active metabolite.

### Toxicity

The oral LD50 if quetiapine in rats is 2000 mg/kg.
20
Overdose information
Some signs and symptoms of a quetiapine overdose include sedation, drowsiness, tachycardia, and hypotension. Clinical trials demonstrate that overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine did not result in death. A lethal outcome was reported in a clinical trial after an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine.  In the case of an acute overdose, ensure to maintain an airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric lavage following intubation (if necessary) along with activated charcoal and a laxative may be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiac monitoring should also take place.
19
A note on QT-interval prolongation in an overdose
Postmarketing reports reveal increases in the cardiac QT interval in cases of quetiapine overdose, concomitant illness, and in those taking drugs that increase QT interval or affect electrolyte levels.
19
Note that disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine may exert additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in patients who have overdosed with quetiapine, and should be avoided.

### Mechanism of action

Although the mechanism of action of quetiapine is not fully understood, several proposed mechanisms exist. In schizophrenia, its actions could occur from the antagonism of dopamine type 2 (D2) and serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. In bipolar depression and major depression, quetiapine's actions may be attributed to the binding of this drug or its metabolite to the norepinephrine transporter. Additional effects of quetiapine, including somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and anticholinergic effects, may result from the antagonism of H1 receptors, adrenergic α1 receptors, and muscarinic M1 receptors, respectively.

**Quetiapine** (branded as **Seroquel** , **Xeroquel** , **Ketipinor** , **Ketilept** and **Derin** ) is a short-acting atypical [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) approved for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and along with an antidepressant to treat major depressive disorder.

Quetiapine was developed by AstraZeneca from 1992-1996 as an improvement from first-generation antipsychotics. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Recreational usage is uncommon, but reports of quetiapine abuse have emerged within the medical literature. This seems to be driven by its [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) effects (to help with sleep or to 'calm down') rather than by its antipsychotic properties. In addition to oral administration, the drug is sometimes taken intranasally by insufflating pulverized tablets. Some estimate that up to 30% of inmates who were seen for psychiatric services in the Los Angeles County Jail were faking psychotic symptoms in an attempt to obtain quetiapine. It is thought that this drug is more commonly abused in prisons than on the street due to its capacity to be regularly prescribed as a sedative and the unavailability in prison of more commonly abused substances.

## History and culture

Quetiapine was developed by AstraZeneca from 1992-1996 as an improvement from first-generation antipsychotics. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Annual sales of Seroquel are approximately \$5.7 billion worldwide, with \$2.9 billion in the United States. The U.S. patent, which was set to expire in 2011, received a pediatric exclusivity extension which pushed its expiration to March 26, 2012. The patent has already expired in Canada.

There are now several name brand versions of quetiapine, such as Quepin, Seroquel and Ketipinor.

## Chemistry

Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug and [dibenzothiazepine](/w/index.php?title=Dibenzothiazepine&action=edit&redlink=1) derivative. Quetiapine contains a thiazepine ring, a seven-membered ring containing one sulfur and one nitrogen group, located at R 1 and R 4 respectively. This ring is fused to two benzene rings, thus forming a dibenzothiazepine moiety. Dibenzothiazepine is connected at R 11 to the nitrogen group of a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring at R 4 .

Piperazine is a six-member unsaturated ring with two nitrogen constituents in the 1,4 positions. This ring is connected at its second nitrogen group to an ethoxyethanol chain. It is connected to R 2 of an ethane chain through an oxygen bridge to an ethanol group. This forms the structure of quetiapine.

It is commonly synthesized by nucleophilic substitution to combine the dibenzothiazepine core with the rest of the structure. Quetiapine is present in its pill form as a fumarate salt.

## Pharmacology

Quetiapine is a powerful [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , and [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenergic) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) , as well as a potent [antihistamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) with clinically negligible [anticholinergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticholinergic) properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as partial [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) at 5-HT1A receptors. In terms of its [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) effects, the precise mechanism of action is unknown, but according to the dopamine theory of schizophrenia, antipsychotic effects might be related to the drug’s ability to reduce dopaminergic neurotransmission within the mesolimbic pathway.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of energy level alterations, this drug has the potential to be extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**

- **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)**
- **[Restless Leg Syndrome](/w/index.php?title=Restless_Leg_Syndrome&action=edit&redlink=1)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general headspace of quetiapine is often described as one of sleepiness, emptiness, apathy, stupor, and catatonia. The specific cognitive effects can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Creativity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_suppression)**
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)**
- **[Focus suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** ### After effects
 
- - **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While quetiapine can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, its effects may persist into the morning afterward, which may lead to users feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)** - This effect typically occurs the morning after quetiapine has been taken as a [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, and only occurs for a few hours upon awakening.
### Combination effects

- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** : Cannabis' effects synergise with quetiapine's effects thus increasing the physical effects of the "high" while decreasing the cognitive effects.
- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** : Due to it being a [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) , quetiapine reduces the effects of psychedelics.
- **[Nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics)** : Quetiapine decreases the effects of some nootropics, especially the ones digested by the CYP450 3A4 enzyme.

## Medical uses

- **Schizophrenia:** There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life.
- **Bipolar disorder:** In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes and acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.
- **Major depressive disorder:** Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect.
- **Parkinsons disease:** Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis due to their very low extrapyramidal side effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g., agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine.
- **Other:** The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders. It is particularly useful as a tool for forced sedation during bad trips or prolonged unwanted stimulation.

## Toxicity and harm potential

Quetiapine likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. Although simply trying this substance at a low to moderate dosage is considered as quite safe, there is an emerging controversy regarding quetiapine fatalities. Approximately 10,000 lawsuits against AstraZeneca for problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to death have been filed by individuals from civilian populations.

Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.

Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than other more commonly used [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

Compared to other antipsychotics, quetiapine has been reported to be relatively safer in overdose. Most instances of acute overdoses result only in sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Quetiapine concentrations within the patients' blood are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Quitiapine is moderately physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the antipsychotic effects and within a week of continuous use. The tolerance to the amount of sedation will be the most noticeable. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction.

The addictive qualities of quetiapine have not been formally studied and are largely known through anecdotal sources. For example, a letter to the editor that appeared in the January 2007 American Journal of Psychiatry has proposed a “need for additional studies to explore the addiction-potential of quetiapine”. The letter reports that its authors are physicians who work in the Ohio correctional system. They report that “prisoners have threatened legal action and even suicide when presented with discontinuation of quetiapine” and that they have “not seen similar drug-seeking behavior with other second-generation antipsychotics of comparable efficacy”.

#### Withdrawal symptoms

Withdrawal symptoms reported to occur after discontinuation of quetiapine and other antipsychotics include nausea, emesis, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, dyskinesia, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, insomnia, nervousness, dizziness, headache, excessive non-stop crying, and anxiety. According to Eli Lilly internal documents, discontinuation of atypical neuroleptics similar to seroquel can also cause psoriasis, gingivitis and other inflammatory conditions, dyspepsia, headache, high blood sugar and other health conditions unrelated to psychiatric condition.

#### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Depressants** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2M2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2M2B) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination potentiates the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) caused by one another. At higher doses, it can lead to a sudden, unexpected loss of consciousness along with a dangerous amount of depressed respiration. There is also an increased risk of suffocating on one's vomit while unconscious. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before a loss of consciousness, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

- **Stimulants** - It can be dangerous to combine depressants with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) due to the risk of accidental excessive intoxication. Stimulants mask the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of depressants, which is the main factor most people use to gauge their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant effects wear off, the effects of the depressant will significantly increase, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , and dangerous [black-out states](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) . This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if one's fluid intake is not closely monitored. If choosing to combine these substances, one should strictly limit themselves to a pre-set schedule of dosing only a certain amount per hour until a maximum threshold has been reached.

- **Dissociatives** - This combination can unpredictably potentiate the [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) and [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) that can be caused by each other. It may also result in a sudden loss of consciousness accompanied by a dangerous degree of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs before consciousness is lost, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

Quetiapine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic. It’s approved by the FDA for schizophrenia, acute bipolar mania/mixed and depression, and bipolar maintenance (as an add-on to lithium or divalproex). The extended-release form is also approved as an add-on for depression.

Though its approved uses are limited, it’s widely used off-label as a single therapy for depression, anxiety, insomnia, OCD, and other conditions.

## Effects

It’s primarily able to control psychotic symptoms, mood disorders, anxiety, and insomnia. Other uses have been explored, such as reducing substance abuse or reducing aggressiveness associated with a variety of conditions.

Common negatives (greater than 5% of patients and more than double the rate of placebo) include: dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, weakness, abdominal pain, sore throat, increased appetite, lethargy, and dyspepsia (indigestion).

Some patients report a general emotional blunting effect. It’s not known how common this is. For some people it’ll alleviate blunted emotion, such as in schizophrenia.

In the long-term there are concerns about significant weight gain, hyperglycemia (high glucose levels), hyperlipidemia (elevated lipids), and diabetes.

Like with many medications, it’s difficult to accurately describe its beneficial and adverse effects. Studies may be biased and high dropout rates lead to a lot of missing data. As such, a skeptical position is useful when evaluating the scientific literature.

The high dropout rate in studies and in clinical settings suggests noncompliance is an issue and that side effects or a lack of efficacy could be common.

#### Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric condition that produces positive symptoms (e.g. delusions, hallucinations), negative symptoms (e.g. low motivation, apathy, tiredness), and impaired cognition.

First-gen antipsychotics have been used for decades. They have proven efficacy for controlling positive symptoms, but they often have little to no effect on the negative and cognitive symptoms. In addition to a restricted efficacy profile, first-gen antipsychotics have a notable link to movement disorders like extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and tardive dyskinesia.

Second-gen antipsychotics are used with the intention of helping a larger set of schizophrenia symptoms while exposing people to a lower risk of movement disorders. There’s some evidence quetiapine and other drugs in this case are effective on those points.

**Efficacy**

Studies typically find quetiapine is significantly better than placebo and has an efficacy not too distinct from first-gen antipsychotics. Because its impact on core symptoms may not be reliably superior (example study: Buckley, 2004), individual differences and tolerability should guide prescribing.

There are some properties that could make it particularly useful in certain populations. Those include a potentially greater alleviation of cognitive deficits and the existence of calming effects that may reduce aggression and hostility, such as during acute exacerbations of schizophrenia.

Cochrane reviews (Asmal, 2013 and Suttajit, 2013) have found it’s similar in efficacy to second-gen drugs like clozapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone. While olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone could be superior.

Reviews indicate it has a lower movement disorder potential than first-gen drugs and some second-gen drugs (e.g. paliperidone, risperidone, and olanzapine). It’s metabolic effects are considered “intermediate” in the second-gen class.

Along with treating the core psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia, quetiapine appears to alleviate mood symptoms, so it can assist with reducing depression.

Doses over 300 mg appear ideal for this condition. Some patients end up even higher than the recommended maximum of 750 mg/d. It’s not clear how high the dose range should go.

**Cognition**

Quetiapine seems to improve attention, motor and visuomotor skills, and executive function. This impact on cognition may be superior to what’s offered by first-gen antipsychotics.

Some evidence suggests unmedicated patients retain better verbal fluency and memory performance, though these results are challengeable. The sedative effects of quetiapine could also reduce cognitive performance in some patients.

**Sexual dysfunction**

Sexual dysfunction is a major problem with some antipsychotics, contributing to reduced compliance and a lower quality of life. It appears to be a relatively minor issue with quetiapine and when it exists, the symptoms aren’t especially severe.

Data from AstraZeneca found the rate of impotence, abnormal ejaculation, and amenorrhea (absence of menstruation) was under 0.1%.

Priapism (an erection lasting hours) has been reported in a few cases. It’s a very rare response.

Quetiapine’s improved profile in this area may be partly the result of comparatively low effects on prolactin. Most patients don’t have a substantial rise in prolactin and those switching from other antipsychotics can see a normalization of their levels. (Stevens, 2005) found prolactin was above the upper limit of normal in 68% of males receiving risperidone, compared to 20% receiving quetiapine.

(Kelly, 2005) – A double-blind 12-week trial showing orgasm quality and ability were significantly better with quetiapine compared to fluphenazine and risperidone.

The greatest issue may be a reduction in libido. (Atmaca, 2005) found diminished libido in a third of males and males.

#### Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric condition featuring marked fluctuations in mood, including episodes of depression and mania. It’s split into two core categories in the DSM-5: Bipolar 1 and Bipolar 2.

Bipolar 1 involves depression accompanied by full manic episodes, while Bipolar 2 involves depression with at least one hypomanic episode.

Quetiapine is effective in all phases of the disorder, including in manic episodes, mixed episodes, and bipolar depression. Efficacy has also been shown for maintenance on its own and as an add-on.

Compared to other antipsychotics, quetiapine has some of the most evidence supporting its use. It was one of the first antipsychotics approved by the FDA as a first-line treatment for both manic and depressive phases.

**Acute states**

When antipsychotics are added to classic mood stabilizers, there may be a faster onset of action and greater control of agitation and psychotic behavior during mania.

There are some case reports of it inducing manic and hypomanic states. This response is atypical and can often be addressed with dose reduction or treatment cessation.

It’s recommended to use a classic mood stabilizer, namely lithium or valproate, with an antipsychotic like quetiapine for severe manic episodes. Milder cases can be treated with a single drug.

Studies in bipolar mania have shown it may have a similar efficacy to lithium for acute mania (Bowden, 2005 and McIntyre, 2005). Manic or hypomanic patients receiving lithium or valproate seem to do better if they also receive quetiapine (Bahk, 2004).

(Smith, 2007) – A review of 13 trials with 3,089 patients. It compared the effects of carbamazepine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, valproate, and aripiprazole in acute bipolar mania. Only 2 studies evaluated quetiapine and because the response rate varied from below placebo to 137% greater than placebo , it was found to be the only drug lacking a significant response difference vs. placebo.

Quetiapine can alleviate, even on its own, bipolar depression (Calabrese, 2004). It seems to reduce core depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and anxiety.

A large review of its use for acute bipolar depression (Suttajit, 2014) used data from 11 studies and 3,488 patients. All of the trials were 1 to 12 weeks long. They compared quetiapine to placebo, SSRIs, lithium, and non-drug IPSRT therapy. Quetiapine was as or more effective than SSRIs, lithium, and non-drug therapy. It’s worth nothing these studies were sponsored by the maker of quetiapine, AstraZeneca.

**Maintenance treatment**

The only FDA-approved way of using quetiapine for maintenance is if it’s combined with a first-line treatment (valproate or lithium). Limited studies (often small sample sizes and open-label designs) suggest it could work on its own (Altamura, 2003).

**Rapid-cycling**

Patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder often have poor or no response to classic mood stabilizers. Quetiapine appears useful in those situations, particularly when added to typical treatments (Vieta, 2002).

**BDNF**

Some evidence points to impaired BDNF levels (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) in bipolar disorder. Levels might be low in acute mood episodes, while returning to normal during a positive non-manic mood state (euthymia). If someone goes through multiple episodes, BDNF levels could remain low (Kauer-Sant’Anna, 2009). There is opposing evidence, however. (Magalhaes, 2012) showed young people with bipolar disorder have normal BDNF levels.

As this is an active area of research, more studies have tried to see if bipolar is linked to impaired BDNF and if treatment normalizes that issue.

(Grande, 2012) – Open-label trial with 25 patients. It found BDNF levels increased for those initially in a depressed state, but they significantly declined if people started quetiapine while in a manic or mixed state.

#### Insomnia

It’s not unheard of for antipsychotics or antidepressants to be used for insomnia. Of those drugs, quetiapine has received more attention than most. It’s one of the most common conditions treated by quetiapine even though it’s not approved for that use and formal evidence is lacking.

The only time it’s officially recommended is if insomnia is secondary to a comorbid disorder like psychosis or depression. Tolerance may build quickly, though a small open-label pilot study (Wiegand, 2008) found it offered improved objective and subjective sleep measures in primary insomnia lasting up to 6 weeks. The starting dose was 25 mg. 7 participants ended up using 50 mg and 1 participant moved up to 75 mg.

(Cohrs, 2004) – The sleep promoting effects were evaluated in 18 healthy males. It was found to significantly increase sleep time, sleep efficiency, and percentage of time spent in Stage 2. REM was reduced. Participants self-reported better sleep when receiving 25 or 100 mg and they said they felt more refreshed.

More evidence exists supporting alternative substances and non-drug options.

Some people only use it occasionally, in which case quetiapine appears quite effective. But it can cause drowsiness the following day, even with the low 25-100 mg doses that are used.

#### Depression

It’s often used as an antidepressant even in patients suffering from unipolar rather than bipolar depression. Quetiapine is only approved as an add-on treatment for depression, specifically in its extended-release form.

Studies have reliably found it can reduce depression in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Some evidence exists supporting antidepressant properties, either on its own or with other drugs, in major depression.

In 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended against approval for depression and anxiety primarily due to concerns about metabolic issues, sudden cardiac death, and movement disorders. The committee recognized it may have efficacy, but concerns over side effects outweighed the perceived benefits.

(Weisler, 2012) – Analysis of two 6-week, double-blind, controlled studies. 968 patients with major depression were randomized to quetiapine XR 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo. The quetiapine groups experienced a significantly higher response rate and and total depression symptom reduction, albeit with small effect sizes. The reductions were significant from Week 1 onward. Only 300 mg led to a significantly higher remission rate.

#### Anxiety

Though it’s not approved for anxiety, it’s often used for that purpose, especially for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Like with depression, studies have shown efficacy, but the effect sizes are often pretty small compared to placebo (Stein, 2011). It may also be used as an add-on drug.

(Katzman, 2010) – Longer-term randomized, controlled trial of quetiapine XR for GAD. 432 patients were stabilized on open-label quetiapine and then randomized to continue quetiapine or placebo. Those receiving quetiapine had a significantly greater reduction in anxiety and fewer (10.2% vs. 38.9%) experienced a recurrence of anxiety symptoms.

(Kreys, 2015) – A review of the literature found quetiapine XR was effective on its own or with other treatments. Efficacy appeared by Week 1 of treatment.

#### Delirium

No antipsychotic is specifically FDA-approved for delirium in hospital settings. Haloperidol has historically been used more than any other.

Some studies (Maneeton, 2013 and Devlin, 2010) show quetiapine is also effective for this purpose and it’s largely equal in efficacy to haloperidol.

#### Substance use

There’s interest in using quetiapine as a treatment for various substance use disorders, most often alcohol. A limited set of evidence stemming from small trials, case reports, and chart reviews, suggests it could reduce craving and alcohol intake. This could conceivably be from a direct effect on craving, potentiation of unpleasant sedative effects, blunting of positive effects, or improved anxiety and sleep (thereby reducing interest in using alcohol for self-medication).

(Martinotti, 2008) – An open-label trial showing positive effects in people with alcohol use disorder and another psychiatric condition, like bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder.

(Kennedy, 2008) – An open trial for cocaine use disorder in non-psychotic individuals. 22 participants entered the trial; only 14 finished. Craving and use declined significantly in the ITT group. The effect size (1.23) was large.

(Cooper, 2012) – This lab study exposed daily cannabis users to cannabis use and withdrawal conditions while giving them 200 mg/d of quetiapine or placebo. Compared with placebo, quetiapine improved sleep quality, increased caloric intake, and decreased weight loss during the withdrawal period. But it also increased cannabis craving and cannabis self-administration when people were given active cannabis again, so it was deemed of little use for cannabis use disorder.

#### Borderline personality disorder

Antipsychotics, including quetiapine, may reduce impulsivity, aggression, depression, and anxiety associated with borderline personality disorder. Only a limited amount of evidence exists, so a conclusion can’t be reached.

(Eynde, 2008) – A 12-week open trial with 41 patients (32 of whom completed). Patients had significant reductions in impulsivity, hostility, and aggression. And they had significantly better overall functioning. The mean end dose was 412.5 mg.

#### Psychosis or agitation associated with Parkinson’s or dementia

The evidence so far indicates it’s not an effective treatment for psychotic symptoms or agitation associated with neurodegeneration.

(Rabey, 2007) – 12-week, double-blind, controlled study. 58 patients with Parkinson’s and psychotic symptoms were randomized to quetiapine (n=30) or placebo (n=28). The patients began the study with severe psychotic symptoms. There was a high dropout rate (50% for quetiapine and 39% for placebo). The average dose was 119 mg. Quetiapine failed to show any significant benefit for psychotic symptoms.

It wasn’t significantly better than placebo for agitation or psychosis associated with dementia or parkinsonism (Kurlan, 2007).

It wasn’t effective at reducing agitation compared to placebo in a double-blind, controlled study in Alzheimer’s disease. Quetiapine patients also had greater cognitive decline (Ballard, 2005).

#### Other medical uses

#### Non-medical

It doesn’t have any notable recreational effects, but some people take it for sedation, sleep-induction, and possibly anxiolysis outside of medical settings. There are reports of people “abusing” it, often in prison/institutionalized settings and in people with a history of psychiatric disorders or substance abuse.

There are reports of people taking it to come down from stimulants, to potentiate other depressants, and to alleviate withdrawal symptoms from various other drugs.

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Quetiapine is a dibenzothiazepine derivative with structural similarities to clozapine. They contain a similar tricyclic heterocycle structure.

One of the nitrogen heteroatoms within clozapine’s dibenzodiazepine ring has been replaced with a sulfur in quetiapine, yielding a dibenzothiazepine ring.

Both drugs also have a piperazine ring substituted at the 4-position of their main tricyclic heterocycle.

#### Pharmacology

Quetiapine affinity (Jensen, 2008)

- D2 – 245 nM
- 5-HT2A – 100 nM
- 5-HT2C – 2502 nM
- 5-HT1A – 432 nM
- 5-HT7 – 307 nM
- H1 – 11 nM
- a1-adrenergic – 22 nM
- a2-adrenergic – 3630 nM
- NET – Over 10,000 nM

Norquetiapine affinity (Jensen, 2008)

- D2 – 196 nM
- 5-HT2A – 48 nM
- 5-HT2C – 107 nM
- 5-HT1A – 45 nM
- 5-HT7 – 76 nM
- H1 – 3.5 nM
- a1-adrenergic – 144 nM
- a2-adrenergic – 237 nM
- NET – 58 nM

Unlike first-gen antipsychotics, its affinity for dopamine D2 receptors is lower than its affinity for other receptors. It has a higher affinity at 5-HT2A, histamine H1, and a1-adrenergic. It’s an antagonist at all of those sites, while it’s a moderate affinity agonist at 5-HT1A.

Its low affinity for D2 and its fast dissociation rate is thought to be the reason movement disorders are less of an issue. Occupancy at therapeutic doses is only around 30% (Gefvert, 2001), whereas first-gen antipsychotics typically have an occupancy of 60-75%. That occupancy is substantially lower than for 5-HT2A (around 75%). Because of its lower D2 binding, there may also be a faster return of psychotic symptoms after each dose.

Other relevant factors in its reduced potential for movement disorders are its short half-life at D2 receptors (~10 hours) and a potential preference for mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine pathways over the nigrostriatal pathways that’d lead to EPS (Goldstein, 1999).

Its pharmacological profile varies by dose. At low doses (~25 mg), it’s mainly an H1 antagonist. Moderate doses (50-100+ mg) incorporate greater serotonin receptor antagonism. High doses (300+ mg) recruit D2 antagonism.

**Norquetiapine**

Norquetiapine reaches around 1/3 the Cmax of quetiapine. Enough seems to be present for its pharmacology to contribute. As such, its actions at the following targets may be important: 5-HT2A (antagonist), 5-HT1A (agonist), 5-HT2C (antagonist), D2 (antagonist), NET (inhibitor).

Its pharmacology overlaps significantly with that of other antipsychotics, antidepressants, and anxiolytics. Two binding sites in particular, 5-HT1A and NET inhibition, are popular targets for anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Therefore it seems possible norquetiapine is contributing to that aspect of quetiapine’s activity.

Norquetiapine’s impact at NET is distinct from that of other antipsychotics, which have no or little affinity (Cross, 2016). That aspect of the drug is more akin to what’s seen with antidepressants like duloxetine and imipramine.

It’s been found to exhibit antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animals. At least some of the anxiolysis is blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist.

**Actions through non-neurotransmitter systems**

Some studies have found anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects with quetiapine. It inhibits nitric oxide generation and TNF-a release from IFN-y-activated microglia in vitro (Bian, 2008).

Along with potentially increasing antioxidant status through a rise in superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Miljevic, 2013), it seems to have direct antioxidant potential. (Xu, 2008) found it directly functioned as a ROS scavenger in an in vitro Alzheimer’s disease model. It was shown to reduce hydroxyl radical concentration in a concentration-dependent manner.

It’s been shown to increase SOD1 (superoxide dismutase) activity in human erythrocytes in vitro and it upregulated SOD1 gene expression (Bai, 2002). But there is a conflicting result in (Schmidt, 2009) showing a drop in mRNA expression of genes encoding for key antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, mnSOD, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. In that study the effects were seen with 300 uM.

**Neuroprotection**

It has neuroprotective properties in vitro and in animals. The protective effects are active against models of Alzheimer’s disease (Xu, 2008), stress-induced impairments (Xu, 2006), ischemia-induced degeneration (Yan, 2007), and methamphetamine toxicity (He, 2006).

Most studies evaluating these kinds of effects have been positive, though chronic quetiapine (5 or 10 mg/kg SC) in rats failed to protect against phencyclidine-induced increased impulsivity and disrupted attention (Amitai, 2008).

Its ability to block a stress-induced decline in cellular proliferation and BDNF expression may be relevant to psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety. Supporting BDNF and cellular proliferation are two mechanisms seen with some antidepressants.

**Genetic effects**

**Sensorimotor gating**

Sensorimotor gating can be assessed by the acoustic startle reflex in humans and animals. Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is used to see how much a weak prepulse inhibits the brain’s response to a subsequent full “pulse.” PPI appears to be impaired in some psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia.

Animal studies have shown quetiapine reverses the PPI-disrupting effects of lesions (Shoemaker, 2003) and the PPI-disrupting effects of knocking out the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Powell, 2008).

**fMRI**

Treatment with quetiapine may restore greater cortical activity in patients with schizophrenia. That increase in activity could underlie some of the cognitive and emotional benefits.

(Meisenzahl, 2006) – A trend towards improved working memory with quetiapine in patients with schizophrenia. This was accompanied by greater activation during the task in the prefrontal cortex.

*Study with 12 healthy controls and 12 patients with schizophrenia. Their working memory performance and neural correlates were studied. The controls naturally had significantly greater activation in the left thalamus, basal ganglia, right DLPFC and in the bilateral VLPFC during a cognitive task. That increase in activation didn’t occur in patients. When quetiapine was used for 12 weeks (mean dose: 566.7 mg/d), an increase in activation was seen, with a significant rise in the left VLPFC during 2-back conditions.*

(Stip, 2005) – Restoration of frontal activation in patients with schizophrenia. This was associated with improved affective symptoms, namely relief of blunted affect.

*5.5 months of treatment (mean dose: 529 mg/d) in 12 participants led to significant reductions in blunted affect. Those reductions were accompanied by increased prefrontal cortex activation when the patients were shown emotional film excerpts.*

(Jones, 2004) – Greater frontal cortex activation during a verbal fluency task and temporal cortex activation during auditory stimulation in patients with schizophrenia given quetiapine.

*This study looked at 7 drug-naive patients, 8 quetiapine patients, and 8 healthy controls. In both situations, quetiapine patients (mean dose: 364 mg/d for 5.7 months) showed significantly greater activation than drug-naive patients. This was the case in the left inferior frontal cortex during the verbal fluency task. In the auditory stimulation condition, greater activation was observed in the superior temporal gyrus.*

(Klasen, 2013) – Modulates functional connectivity in brain aggression networks in healthy people.

*13 healthy males were tested in a double-blind, cross-over manner while playing a violent video game meant to induce “aggression.” Functional connectivity between the amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in the quetiapine condition. Functional connectivity also increased with the DLPFC. Whereas violence-specific connectivity declined between the amygdala and right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).*

#### Pharmacokinetics

Tmax: 1 – 2 hours

Half-life: 7 hours

Protein binding: 83%

Excretion: 73% in urine and 21% in feces

**Interactions**

Phenytoin is a potent inducer of CYP3A4, so higher doses of quetiapine may be needed.

(DeVane, 2001) – Neither risperidone nor haloperidol impacted its kinetics, but thioridazine produced decreased in the AUC (-40%), Cmax (-22%), and Cmin (-31%). This occurred by an unknown mechanism.

Ketoconazole produced a 4.03x greater Cmax.

**Polymorphisms**

(Weide, 2014) – The impact of CYP3A4 polymorphisms was studied in 238 adult patients. Carriers of the CYP3A4*22 allele had a 2.5-fold higher serum concentration compared to wild-type patients receiving a similar dose. The dose-corrected serum concentration was 67% higher in carriers.

---

The kinetics of quetiapine appear unaffected by dose, ethnicity, gender, and weight. Bioavailability of the IR formulation isn’t affected by food. In elderly patients the target dose showed be lowered because mean plasma clearance is reduced 30-50%.

Its primary metabolic route is via CYP3A4. The most abundant metabolites appear to be quetiapine carboxylic acid and quetiapine sulfoxide. Together they account for ~30% of the quetiapine dose.

At least one active metabolite, norquetiapine, seems relevant. Another (7-hydroxyquetiapine) is also produced, but only very small concentrations are reached.

## History

#### 1985

Quetiapine was developed by AstraZeneca.

#### 1997

Quetiapine was approved for use in the US by the FDA in September 1997. It entered the market under the name “Seroquel.”

#### 2006

It was by this point approved for use and available in over 80 countries worldwide.

#### 2007

Three second-gen antipsychotics (olanzapine, risperidone, and quetiapine) were among the 10 top-selling drugs worldwide, with a combined sales volume of \$14.5 billion.

#### 2008

Quetiapine sales reached nearly \$4.5 billion.

#### 2009

According to the Associated Press, the Pentagon and Department of Veterans Affairs spent \$8.6 million and \$125.4 million on the drug, respectively.

#### 2009

In April 2009, the FDA’s Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to advise the FDA on whether quetiapine should be approved for anxiety and depression. Dr. Thomas Laughren (director of the FDA’s Division of Psychiatric Products) noted that although AstraZeneca’s data showed efficacy, the agency was concerned about more widespread use due to the metabolic, movement disorder, and cardiac risks.

Dr. Wayne Goodman (the panel’s acting chair and director of adult translational research at the NIMH) said the panel found quetiapine acceptably safe as an add-on for depression (Vote: 6 to 3). This decision wasn’t considered precedent-setting because the agency previously approved the antipsychotic aripiprazole for that use.

Due to the side effect potential, it wasn’t recommended the drug be approved for depression or anxiety as a single therapy.

#### 2010

AstraZeneca paid a \$520 million settlement due to improper marketing of quetiapine and improper handling of some clinical trials. Because of multiple lawsuits filed against the drug maker, some of the company’s internal activities were revealed.

Internal emails reveal it buried and misrepresented studies showing a lack of superior efficacy compared to first-gen drugs. It did the same with studies showing a notable risk of obesity and weight gain.

The emails show employees clearly knew the results were damaging to the drug’s potential, but they kept sharing inaccurate information and hiding useful data from physicians and the public. AstraZeneca also fought the FDA when the agency requested it inform doctors about a greater than previously suggested risk of diabetes.

In one case, the company learned of clinical data pointing to significant weight gain potential. Rather than discuss that potential side effect, it presented data showing weight loss at an American Psychiatric Association conference.

#### 2010

(Monasterio, 2011) – Survey of off-label second-gen antipsychotic prescribing by psychiatrists in Christchurch, New Zealand. Quetiapine was the preferred drug in 94% of cases and 59% of respondents prescribed it off-label every week in cases with little scientific evidence of safety and efficacy.

#### 2000s to 2010s

Data from PHARMAC (pharmaceutical funding agency in New Zealand) was used to look at prescribing trends over 10 years. There was a 700% increase in quetiapine prescribing and a shift from specialists to general practitioners. GPs prescribed 2.5x more quetiapine than specialists in 2011, whereas specialists prescribed 4x more than GPs in 2002.

GPs were also more likely to prescribe low-dose quetiapine.

In 2011, 36% of GP prescribing and 19% of specialist prescribing was for under 100 mg/d.

#### 2012

The IR formulation became available as a generic drug in the US in March 2012.

#### 2013

An IMS Health report showed quetiapine was the most frequently prescribed second-gen antipsychotic in the US with over 14 million dispensed prescriptions in 2013.

#### 2017

AstraZeneca was still dealing with whistleblower lawsuits over misrepresentation of data and off-label marketing. Those legal actions reveal it may have hidden risks about combining quetiapine with other medications capable of QT/QTc prolongation, which raises the risk of sudden cardiac death from fatal arrhythmias.

---

## Legal Status (as of November 2017)

#### United States

Prescription-only

#### Other countries

It’s also prescription-only in Australia, Canada, and the UK.

---

## Safety

#### Overdose

It has a favorable overdose profile, with very few deaths coming from direct toxicity. Though it does come with some potential for coma, respiratory depression, rhabdomyolysis, and cardiovascular issues (like a prolonged QT interval and Torsades de pointes), the outcome of overdoses is rarely death.

Some of the most common symptoms are increased heart rate (tachycardia) and drowsiness, including to the point of unconsciousness. Some other potential symptoms include hypotension, delirium, and seizures.

Because there are quite a few cases where mechanical ventilation or other significant interventions have been required, more deaths would exist if not for medical treatment.

#### Movement disorders and neuroleptic malignant syndrome

Some research has found quetiapine causes no increased risk of EPS, even in vulnerable groups like the elderly, adolescents, or patients with organic brain disorders.

Because other studies have found a somewhat elevated rate of EPS, it doesn’t appear entirely risk-free, but it less problematic than first-gen antipsychotics. There have been rare reports of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (Kobayashi, 2006) and tardive dyskinesia as well. Again, those issues are less common than with first-gen antipsychotics.

#### Metabolic

Quetiapine has a verified connection to weight gain and it may raise your risk of obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. Typically the effects are limited to relatively moderate weight gain, with some studies failing to even show an increase in weight. But a minority of patients will experience more problematic effects, raising their risk of various disorders in the long-term.

Significant cholesterol changes usually aren’t reported. Increases in fasting triglycerides and glucose are more common. A triglyceride level over 200 mg/dl may be upwards of 3x more common with quetiapine than with placebo (Stein, 2011).

The bulk of the evidence points to an average weight increase of 1 – 3 kg (2 – 7 lbs) over a period of a few months. Based on a limited number of long-term studies, it doesn’t seem to progressively increase weight indefinitely.

(Rummel-Kluge, 2010) – A head-to-head comparison of the metabolic side effects of second-gen antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. This review yielded 45 studies, 11 of which included quetiapine. Overall, olanzapine and clozapine were worst for weight, cholesterol, and glucose changes. Quetiapine, risperidone, and sertindole had intermediate effects,. Aripiprazole and amisulpride had intermediate or low elevations. Ziprasidone had the lowest impact.

#### Endocrine

It has minimal impact on prolactin levels, making it superior in that regard to some antipsychotics. The lack of impact on prolactin could be due to reduced dopamine antagonism in the tuberohypophyseal pathway relative to other antipsychotics.

(de Borja, 2005) – In healthy volunteers it produced an acute rise in prolactin and a decline in cortisol with 150 mg. There was also a significant increase in growth hormone secretion later on.

(Kelly, 2005) – Based on data from 38 patients, quetiapine had no influence on thyroid function.

#### Seizures

(Dev, 2000) – A clinical trial with 3,700 patients didn’t show an increased rate of seizures.

#### Pregnancy

The available data doesn’t indicate a connection to major malformations during pregnancy.

#### Hematological

(Croarkin, 2001) – 1% of patients develop leukopenia (reduced white blood cell count; raises infection risk). This resolves with discontinuation of the drug.

#### Psychological

Occasional reports of drug-induced mania, hypomania, or depression exist.

#### Hepatic (liver)

Quetiapine is typically considered safe in regards to its impact on liver function, but there are reports of elevated liver enzymes, elevated bilirubin, and rarely hepatotoxicity.

Around a quarter of patients (Atasoy, 2007) could have an asymptomatic elevation in liver enzymes after starting the drug. That elevation appears to decline over time.

**Cardiovascular**

Multiple studies have shown a connection between first-gen antipsychotics and sudden cardiac death. It was long believed second-gen drugs like quetiapine came with a substantially lower risk, but that may not be the case. Both classes have been shown to prolong the QT interval and using antipsychotics is a risk factor for sudden death.

The risks are even greater if you combine quetiapine with another drug capable of QT prolongation.

(Ray, 2009) – A major epidemiologial study showed an increased risk of sudden cardiac death with second-gen antipsychotics. Using data on 93,300 antipsychotic users and 186,000 controls, current users of both first- and second-gen antipsychotics had a higher risk of sudden cardiac death. Former users didn’t have a higher risk than the non-using population. Differences were found within the classes. For second-gen drugs, quetiapine’s relative risk was half that of clozapine’s. The risk with quetiapine is dose-dependent, with low doses (under 75 mg/d) showing minimal increase in risk and high doses showing an increase akin to that of first-gen drugs.

Because there are cardiovascular risks, limiting use in more vulnerable populations (e.g. the elderly) could make sense.

#### Dependence

Physical dependence does exist with quetiapine and withdrawal symptoms are possible when use stops. Those symptoms are worst with abrupt discontinuation, so tapering is recommended.

The symptoms can include sweating (diaphoresis), increased blood pressure, vomiting, lightheadedness, nausea, nervousness, insomnia, anxiety, and increased heart rate (tachycardia).

A return of psychotic symptoms is also possible.

#### Risky combos (list may not be complete)

- Other depressants, including alcohol.
- Drugs that can prolong the QT interval.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quetiapine*

Quetiapine ( kwi-TY-ə-peen), sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely prescribed as a sleep aid due to its tranquillizing effects, the benefits of such use may not outweigh the risk of undesirable side effects. It is taken orally.
Common side effects include sedation, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine.
Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the most prescribed antipsychotic and 60th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 10 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.  
The drug is typically among two antipsychotics (the other being olanzapine) to have superior efficacy for the treatment of bipolar disorder. Quetiapine is one of only two antipsychotics (the other is cariprazine) that produce equal efficacy as standalone therapies for mixed manic-depressive mood swings as they do in combination with an SSRI antidepressant. But it is less potent than clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone in alleviating psychotic symptoms or treating schizophrenia.

## Medical uses

Quetiapine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It targets both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

### Schizophrenia

A 2013 Cochrane review compared quetiapine to typical antipsychotics: 

In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, quetiapine demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine and approximately as effective as haloperidol and aripiprazole.
There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life.
It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are more effective. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth.
A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than olanzapine and risperidone; produce fewer movement related side effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, clozapine and aripiprazole. It found that quetiapine produces suicide attempts; death; QTc prolongation, low blood pressure; tachycardia; sedation; gynaecomastia; galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity, and decline in white blood cell count at a rate similar to first-generation antipsychotics.

### Bipolar disorder

In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes; acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium; valproate or lamotrigine); acute mixed episodes; and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex).

### Major depressive disorder

Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD), but sedation is often an undesirable side effect.
In the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add-on treatment in MDD.

### Alzheimer's disease

Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with Alzheimer's disease. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended.

### Insomnia

The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. A 2022 network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Quetiapine, specifically, had an effect size (standardized mean difference) against placebo for treatment of insomnia of 0.05 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –1.21 to 1.11) at 4 weeks of treatment, with the certainty of evidence rated as very low. Doses of quetiapine used for insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg, with low doses of 25 to 200 mg being the most typical. Regardless of the dose used, some of the more serious adverse effects may still possibly occur at the lower dosing ranges, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. Increases in serum triglycerides, LDL-C, and fasting blood glucose have been observed following quetiapine treatment at doses typically used off-label in the treatment of insomnia. These safety concerns at low doses are corroborated by Danish observational studies that showed use of specifically low-dose quetiapine (prescriptions filled for tablet strengths >50 mg were excluded) was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at 1-year follow-up.

### Others

It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders.
Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis due to their relatively low extrapyramidal side-effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine.

## Adverse effects

Sources for incidence lists:

Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects
Dry mouth
Dizziness
Headache
Somnolence (drowsiness; of 15 antipsychotics quetiapine causes the 5th most sedation. Extended release (XR) formulations tend to produce less sedation, dose-by-dose, than the immediate release formulations.)
Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects

Extrapyramidal disease: Quetiapine and clozapine are noted for their relative lack of extrapyramidal side effects.
Weight gain: SMD 0.43 kg when compared to placebo. Produces roughly as much weight gain as risperidone, less weight gain than clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine and more weight gain than ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine. As with many other atypical antipsychotics, this action is likely due to its actions at the H1 histamine receptor and 5-HT2C receptor.
Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc.
Tardive dyskinesia. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine
Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals.
Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole.
As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the seizure threshold, and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as bupropion.

### Discontinuation

The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time.
There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped.

### Pregnancy and lactation

Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed.

### Abuse potential

In contrast to most other antipsychotic drugs, which tend to be somewhat aversive and often show problems with patient compliance with prescribed medication regimes, quetiapine is sometimes associated with drug misuse and abuse potential, for its hypnotic and sedative effects. It has a limited potential for misuse, usually only in individuals with a history of polysubstance abuse and/or mental illness, and especially in those incarcerated in prisons or secure psychiatric facilities where access to alternative intoxicants is more limited. To a significantly greater extent than other atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine was found to be associated with drug-seeking behaviors, and to have standardised street prices and slang terms associated with it, either by itself or in combination with other drugs (such as "Q-ball" for the intravenous injection of quetiapine mixed with cocaine). The pharmacological basis for this distinction from other second generation antipsychotic drugs is unclear, though it has been suggested that quetiapine's comparatively lower dopamine receptor affinity and strong antihistamine activity might mean it could be regarded as more similar to sedating antihistamines in this context. While these issues have not been regarded as sufficient cause for placing quetiapine under increased legal controls, prescribers have been urged to show caution when prescribing quetiapine to individuals with characteristics that might place them at increased risk for drug misuse.

## Overdose

Most instances of acute overdosage result in only sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases. Non-toxic levels in postmortem blood extend to around 0.8 mg/kg, but toxic levels in postmortem blood can begin at 0.35 mg/kg.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Quetiapine has the following pharmacological actions:

Dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor antagonist
Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F receptor ligand
α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist
Histamine H1 receptor antagonist
Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist
This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist to all other serotonin receptors it has affinity for. Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor. Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin. Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters.
At very low doses, quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and α1-adrenergic blocker. When the dose is increased, quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and autoreceptors. At high doses, quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors. Due to the drug's sedating H1 activity, it is often prescribed at low doses for insomnia. While some feel that low doses of drugs with antihistamine effects like quetiapine and mirtazapine are safer than drugs associated with physical dependency or other risk factors, concern has been raised by some professionals that off-label prescribing has become too widespread due to underappreciated hazards.
When treating schizophrenia, antagonism of D2 receptor by quetiapine in the mesolimbic pathway relieves positive symptoms and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor in the frontal cortex of the brain may relieve negative symptoms and reduce severity of psychotic episodes. Quetiapine has fewer extrapyramidal side effects and is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia when compared to other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, so is used as a first line treatment.
Since the noradrenaline transporter is responsible for most of the dopamine clearance in the prefrontal cortex, norquetiapine blocks reuptake of dopamine too, accumulating the dopamine in the synapse.

### Pharmacokinetics

Peak levels of quetiapine occur 1.5 hours after a dose. The plasma protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. The major active metabolite of quetiapine is norquetiapine (N-desalkylquetiapine). Quetiapine has an elimination half-life of 6 or 7 hours. Its metabolite, norquetiapine, has a half-life of 9 to 12 hours. Quetiapine is excreted primarily via the kidneys (73%) and in feces (20%) after hepatic metabolism, the remainder (1%) is excreted as the drug in its unmetabolized form.

## Chemistry

Quetiapine is a tetracyclic compound and is closely related structurally to clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, and other tetracyclic antipsychotics.

### Synthesis

The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The lactam is first treated with phosphoryl chloride to produce a dibenzothiazepine. A nucleophilic substitution is used to introduce the sidechain.

## History

### Sustained-release

AstraZeneca submitted a new drug application for a sustained-release version of quetiapine in the United States, Canada, and the European Union in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia.
In May 2007, the US FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia. During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007. However, Seroquel XR has become available in U.S. pharmacies only after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on 16 November 2007. The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR's launch.

## Society and culture

### Regulatory status

In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar mania) and for treatment of bipolar depression. In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder.
Quetiapine received its initial approval from the US FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in 1997. In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder. In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine's efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression.
Patent protection for the product ended in 2012; however, in a number of regions, the long-acting version remained under patent until 2017.

### Lawsuits

In April 2010, the U. S. Department of Justice fined AstraZeneca \$520 million for the company's aggressive marketing of Seroquel for off-label uses. According to the Department of Justice, "the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel."
Multiple lawsuits have been filed in relation to quetiapine's side-effects, in particular, diabetes.
Approximately 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against AstraZeneca, alleging that quetiapine caused problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to deaths.

### Controversy

In 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial Seroquel clinical trial at the University of Minnesota while under an involuntary commitment order. A group of University of Minnesota bioethicists charged that the trial involved an alarming number of ethical violations.

### Nurofen Plus tampering case

In August 2011, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a class-4 drug alert following reports that some batches of Nurofen plus contained Seroquel XL tablets instead.
Following the issue of the Class-4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50 mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product Neurontin 100 mg capsules.
Following discussions with the MHRA's Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size, leading to a Class-1 Drug Alert. The contamination was later traced to in-store tampering by a customer.
