**N,N-Dipropyltryptamine** (also known as **Dipropyltryptamine** , **DPT** , and **"The Light"** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is closely related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and is reported to be uniquely similar in its hallucinogenic intensity, albeit with a moderately longer duration and greater unpredictability relative to DMT and other psychedelic tryptamines.

DPT was first synthesized in 1950. Human use was first reported in 1973, where it was researched in low doses as an adjunct to therapy for alcoholism. It has also been researched in high doses to induce peak experiences for terminal cancer patients. It has gained some notoriety for its adoption as the primary sacrament for the "Temple of the True Inner Light" in the United States, a Christian off-shoot organization who believe in the ritual use of [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and refer to them as "the true flesh of God."

DPT is commonly consumed via [insufflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflation) or [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) . Many report the experience of insufflation to be very congestive and painful which, with the rapidness of onset, does not give the user much time to acclimate themselves to its powerful effects. It can also be administered [intramuscularly](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Intramuscular) or via [vaporization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporization) after conversion to the freebase form. Smoking the freebase is reported to be the preferred route used by the "Temple of True Inner Light". More experienced members ingest a DPT tea. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of DPT, and it has relatively little history of human usage. It has long been available on the [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) market as a legal, grey-market alternative to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , and commercially distributed through online vendors. Many reports also suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not already very experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to approach this powerful [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) when using it.

## Chemistry

DPT, or N,N-dipropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. DPT contains two propyl groups carbon chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone.

DPT has a number of substituted analogs such as [4-HO-DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DPT) or [4-AcO-DPT](/w/index.php?title=4-AcO-DPT&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective 5-HT 2A receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggest that the 5-HT 2A receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist also imply a 5-HT 1A -mediated component to the actions of DPT. The role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

Relative to psychedelic tryptamines like DMT, DPT is often reported to be similar in its [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) intensity, albeit with a moderately longer duration and more challenging effects. DPT experiences are often described as a "bizarre", "unsettling", and "darker" version of DMT experiences. DPT is reported to be more sensual and physical than DMT and other psychedelics with a corresponding amount of adverse physical effects.

At light to moderate doses, users often report a slight sense of anaesthetization and relaxation. As the dose increases, hyper-awareness of one's heart rate and breathing increases and body tremors and loss of muscle control are often reported. The effects of DPT can range from strong euphoria and sensuality to nausea, panic, and intense states dysphoria even within the same experience.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of DPT is generally more prominent to that of the better known [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . There is often the sensation of limbs feeling disconnected from the body, a force pinning the body to the surface on which it lay and body tremors which can often make the user feel aware of but not in control of their body. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Changes in felt bodily form](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_bodily_form)**
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)** - At higher doses, physical feelings of moving through spaces at quick speeds or being completely pinned down are common.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - This effect appears to occur with more regularity and intensity than other psychedelic tryptamines. ### Visual effects

#### Geometry
 
DPT visual geometry can be described through its variations as intricate in complexity, both abstract and concrete in form, more digital than organic in feel, choppy and only loosely structured in organization, brightly lit, multicolored in scheme, sharp in its edges, fast in speed, simultaneously smooth and glitching in motion, immersive in depth, and consistent in intensity. At higher doses, it is more likely to result in states of [level 8A geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) over level 8B.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
DPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of any other commonly used psychedelic barring [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) and [ibogaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ibogaine) . These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - These are reported to be more common with DPT than with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which lends to its common description as feeling more "industrial" and futuristic, while [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) visuals can often be described as "ancient" or "earthy" in feel.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - As with [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , DPT produces high level internal hallucinations at appropriate doses more consistently than most other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . They are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, non-autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental narrative in their overall theme, with a tendency towards chaotic disorganization and incoherence.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - These are more common within dark environments and can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, non-autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and typically of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental narrative in their overall theme, with a tendency towards chaotic disorganization and incoherence. ### Cognitive effects

- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- Many reports indicate that while DPT possesses the raw [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) power to induce transpersonal states traditionally associated with "classical psychedelics", it does so in a significantly less consistent fashion due to the utter bizarreness and oft-noted "sinister", chaotic, or "forceful" undertones that can be present throughout the experience. What insights it can lead the user to typically occur during the aftermath and integration phase that follows, which shares some qualities of a typical near-death experience.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational DPT do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because DPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. There has been one death associated with the use DPT and seizures, but the dose is unknown.

Anecdotal reports from those who have taken DPT suggests that negative health effects are not likely to occur from simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it sparingly (although nothing can be guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

DPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. As with most psychedelics, it is reported to be self-limiting.

Tolerance to the effects of DPT has been shown to not be built in animal models. However, it has been reported to be able to build slightly relative to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , although still to an insignificant degree compared to most psychedelics.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and LSD also has the potential to induce seizures in susceptible individuals. and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is often used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It may possibly cause elevated risk of seizures and psychosis due to its [glutaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
