**3-MeO-PCP may be more likely to cause [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to take this substance in high dosages, for multiple days in a row, or in combination with other substances that increase the risk of psychosis. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**3-Methoxyphencyclidine** (also known as **3-MeO-PCP** ) is a lesser-known novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class. 3-MeO-PCP is a derivative of [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) ( **PCP** ) and is chemically related to substances like [methoxetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methoxetamine) and [3-MeO-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCE) . It produces its effects by blocking [NMDA receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor) in the brain.

3-MeO-PCP was first synthesized in 1979 in an investigation of [phencyclidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phencyclidine) (PCP) derivatives. However, its activity in humans was not described until 1999 when a chemist using the pseudonym John Q. Beagle reported qualitative similarities to [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) along with comparable potency. In 2009, it began to be discussed on online forums such as bluelight.ru and was made available for sale on the [research chemicals](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemicals) market.

Like other arylcyclohexylamines, 3-MeO-PCP induces a state referred to as " [dissociative anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives#Subjective_effects) ", although the extent to which this occurs is reported to be highly dose-dependent and variable in its effects. It is commonly taken [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) and [nasally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nasally) , although it may also be [smoked](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Smoked) and [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) . It has been noted for its subtle come up and tendency to produce [delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions#Delusion_of_sobriety) , which can lead to [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) .

Very little data exists for the pharmacology, metabolism, and toxicity of 3-MeO-PCP. Due to its potent hallucinogenic effects and lack of research, it is strongly advised to use use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3-Methoxyphencyclidine, or 3-MeO-PCP, is a synthetic dissociative of the arylcyclohexylamine class. 3-MeO-PCP contains cyclohexane, a six-member saturated ring, bonded to two additional rings at R 1 . One of these rings is a piperidine ring, a nitrogenous six member ring, bonded at its nitrogen group. The other ring is an aromatic phenyl ring, substituted at R 3 with a methoxy group.

3-MeO-PCP is a [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) derivative and structurally analogous to [4-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-MeO-PCP) .

## Pharmacology

3-MeO-PCP acts as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . A specific subtype of glutamate receptor, NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate), modulates the transmission of electrical signals between neurons in the brain and spinal cord; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open.

Dissociatives inhibit the normal functioning NMDA receptors by binding to and blocking them. This disruption of neural network activity leads to loss of normal cognitive and affective processing, psychomotor functioning, anesthesia and eventually the equivalent of a "k-hole".

3-MeO-PCP has a Ki of 20 nM for the NMDA receptor, 42 nM for the sigma-1 receptor, 216 nM for the serotonin transporter (SERT), and 2960 nM with H1 receptor It binds to the NMDA receptor with higher affinity than PCP and has the highest affinity of the three isomeric anisyl-substitutions, followed by 2-MeO-PCP and 4-MeO-PCP. Like its sister compound PCP and unlike ketamine, 3-MeO-PCP shows a high affinity for inhibiting the relatively unstudied PCP2 glutamate receptor. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Although 3-MeO-PCP was once claimed to possess opioid or dopaminergic activity, this supposition is contradicted by data showing 3-MeO-PCP to be a potent and selective ligand for the NMDA receptor without appreciable affinity for the µ-opioid receptor or dopamine transporter. 3-MeO-PCP was preceded by the less potent dissociative 4-MeO-PCP and first became available as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) in 2011.

## Subjective effects

3-MeO-PCP is commonly described as being more stimulating and less immobilizing than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) .

At lower doses, it can induce sensory enhancements such as [color enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Color_enhancement) , [acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement) , [tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement) , [auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement) and [bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement) . At medium to high doses it presents sensory suppressions such as [tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression) , [motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss) , [auditory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression) and [acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_suppression) .

Based on a large amount of experience reports, it appears to be considerably more likely to induce [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) than other dissociatives (possibly due to its unusually high potency, [compulsivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) and erratic dose response).

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - 3-MeO-PCP is regarded to be noticeably stimulating in comparison to other dissociatives such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , or [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) . The stimulation it presents is described as clear and subtle.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The body high of 3-MeO-PCP can be described in terms of its style variations as a motionless, constant, sharp, all-encompassing, and euphoric activation of nerve endings across the body.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - 3-MeO-PCP has been reported to more readily induce euphoria than most other dissociatives, such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , especially of the manic variant.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** or **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - At lower dosages, this compound tends to induce tactile enhancements. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards tactile suppressions and [anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) .
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - This substance produces distinct nerve-signal blocking anesthetic effects typically required in surgical settings, but only in the stronger to heavier dose ranges.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** or **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - At lower dosages this compound typically induces enhancements in bodily control. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards motor control loss.
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)** - In contrast to other dissociatives like ketamine, this effect is only prominent at high doses.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** or **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - The appetite suppression present with 3-MeO-PCP can be considered to be less sharp than with substances such as [Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [Ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . Like ketamine, this is due to the disconnection of electrical signals at high doses. Unlike ketamine, it is also possible to experience a noticeable appetite enhancement that is less prominent than its sister compound [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) .
- **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**

- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This effect grows more pronounced with increased dose.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - This effect has been reported as being more pronounced than other dissociatives, such as [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) or [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - The extent to which this effect can be produced is unknown but can likely happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)** or **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - While lower doses of this compound tend to produce mild visual acuity enhancements, this effect quickly disappears as one's general visual faculties become suppressed as the dose is increased.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-MeO-PCP use has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-MeO-PCP has very short history of human usage.

There is one death involving this substance recorded in the medical literature. In this case, the individual's cause of death was determined to be from a combination of 3-MeO-PCP, [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [diphenhydramine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine) .

### Dependence and abuse potential

3-MeO-PCP produces dependence with chronic use and has a high potential for abuse. In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) , 3-MeO-PCP has been reported to be more likely to produce psychological dependence than other dissociatives. When dependence has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if one suddenly stops their usage. There are multiple online reports of users becoming seriously dependent on this substance.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-MeO-PCP develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-MeO-PCP presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) , meaning that after the consumption of 3-MeO-PCP, all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

3-MeO-PCP has been reported to cause [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) at a significantly higher rate than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . There are a large number of experience reports online which describe states of "psychotic delirium, amnesia, mania, and other serious consequences" after abusing 3-MeO-PCP. In some cases, it has resulted in hospitalization and occasionally has taken up to a week or more to resolve.

- Users should avoid taking 3-MeO-PCP for multiple days in a row or becoming dependent on it as this seems to be the main risk factor in the observed incidences of severe adverse effects.
- The recommended dosage range should not be exceeded as high doses can trigger these effects as well.
- Users should start with extremely low doses and work their way up as slowly as possible. [Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) should preferably be used due to the drug's potency; most standard milligram scales cannot accurately weigh out doses below 10-15mg.
- [Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) before one has fully sobered up is not recommended and can result in too high of a dose.

Due to the risk of psychosis, it is not recommended to combine this substance with other substances, especially [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , or other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) like [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Urinary tract effects

In terms of its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and excessively for extended periods of time, 3-MeO-PCP seems to exhibit almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , but to a lesser extent. This is possibly because 3-MeO-PCP is far more potent than ketamine so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Increased urinary tract effects will compound with usage of other drugs like amphetamine even if the drugs are not simultaneously used. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become extremely serious and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, particularly as the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

These effects can be mitigated by refraining from using 3-MeO-PCP regularly (on a daily or weekly basis) and manually limiting one's usage of the substance.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) : 3-MeO-PCP acts as a mild serotonin releasing agent and could interact negatively with the serotonin release of MDMA
