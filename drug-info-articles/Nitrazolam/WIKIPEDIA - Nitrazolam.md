*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrazolam*

Nitrazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD) 
, which are benzodiazepine (BZD) derivatives, that has been sold online as a designer drug.
It is closely related to clonazolam or flunitrazolam, only differing by the removal of a chlorine or fluorine group respectively at the benzene ring.
A study in mice indicated that nitrazolam can be several times more potent than diazepam as an antagonist of electroshock-induced tonic-extensor convulsions but less potent than diazepam at preventing the righting reflex.
Nitrazolam has been used as an example compound to demonstrate the microscale synthesis of reference materials utilizing polymer‐supported reagents.
