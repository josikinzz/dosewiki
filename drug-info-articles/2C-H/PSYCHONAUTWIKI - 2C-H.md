## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Common: Unknown

**Duration:**
- Total: Unknowm

**2,5-Dimethoxyphenethylamine** (also known as **2C-H** ) is a lesser-known psychoactive substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. 2C-H belongs to the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family of substituted phenethylamines. However, it does not have any significant psychedelic properties and is primarily used as a precursor in the synthesis of other phenethylamines such as 2C-B, 2C-I, and 2C-N.

2C-H was first synthesized in 1932 by Johannes S. Buck. Its effects in humans were explored in the 1970s by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who published his findings in the book [PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) .

In PiHKAL, Shulgin lists both the dosage and duration as unknown, commenting that 2C-H is likely easily broken down by MAO enzymes in the liver and is thus probably inactive. However, there have since been some anecdotal reports that suggest it may be active when taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingually) . It is theorized to be [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active if taken in combination with a [MAOI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) . However, it is unknown whether this would result in typical 2C-x psychedelic effects.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-H. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) when using this substance.

## Chemistry

2C-H, or 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-H contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as a hydrogen atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-H belongs to the [2C family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring, and is also their simplest member. It is commonly used as a precursor to other compounds of the 2C family, including [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , [2C-C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-C) , [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , and [2C-N](/w/index.php?title=2C-N&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

There is no record of 2C-H trials in humans, as it would likely be destroyed by monoamine oxidase enzymes before causing any significant psychoactive effects. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-H. However, it has been shown to have binding affinity towards [5-HT2C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) and [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) in rats. 2C-H has been shown to inhibit MAO-B activity by over 50% in experiments.

## Subjective effects

The effects of 2C-H are reportedly inactive. Taking higher dosages could produce primarily stimulating in addition to empathogenic or hallucinogenic effects, in a fashion similar to those of its predecessor substance, [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-H use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-H is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 2C-H suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.duckduckgo.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance so as to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that as is the case with psychedelics in general, 2C-H is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. However, it's stimulating properties do provide a possible risk of addiction which would be associated with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) .

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-H is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3-5 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7-10 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-H may present cross-tolerance, although unlikely, with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-H all psychedelics will have a reduced effect. It may also produce tolerance to stimulants as well.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-H. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals.
