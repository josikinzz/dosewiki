**MDAI** (**5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane**) is a drug developed in the 1990s by a team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. It acts as a non-neurotoxic and highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) which produces entactogen effects in humans similar to that of MDMA.

In terms of its chemistry, the chemical structure of MDAI is indirectly derived from that of the illicit drug MDA, but the alpha-methyl group of the alkylamino amphetamine side chain has been bound back to the benzene nucleus to form an indane ring system. This changes its pharmacological properties substantially.

In terms of its pharmacology, MDAI has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. This demonstrates that MDAI has selective affinity for the serotonin receptor. Studies show that the brains of animals treated with MDAI have greater extracellular concentrations of monoamine neural transmitters, most significantly serotonin. This result indicates that MDAI is a potent releaser of serotonin while effectively inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. For comparison, MDAI is similar in potency with releasing serotonin to MDA but significantly less potent than MDMA.

The effects listed below are based upon the [subjective effects index](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index) and personal experiences of [PsychonautWiki](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) contributors. The listed effects may rarely if ever occur all at once but heavier dosages will increase the chances and are more likely to induce a full range of effects.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of MDAI can be broken down into seven components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Euphoria)**
- [Enhancement of touch](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Enhancement_of_touch)
- [Sedation](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Sedation) - The biggest difference between MDAI and MDMA is that due to a comparative lack of dopamine reuptake inhibition, MDAI primarily results in moderate sedation and therefore discourages physical activities such as running, dancing or climbing.
- [Spontaneous tactile sensations](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Spontaneous_tactile_sensations) - The “body high” of MDAI can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric, soft and warm tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher dosages. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- [Dehydration](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_effects:_Dehydration) - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDAI; this effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated, especially when out dancing in a hot environment, there have been a number of users suffering from water intoxication through over-drinking so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over-drink.
- [Vibrating vision](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Vibrating_vision) - At high dosages, a person’s eyeballs may even begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus– a condition known as nystagmus.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The cognitive effects of MDAI can be broken down into four components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDAI is described by many as one of euphoria and feelings of love or empathy. It contains a number of typical entactogenic cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include:

- **[Euphoria](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDAI and are a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- [Increased empathy, love and sociability](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Increased_empathy,_love_and_sociability) - This particular effect is equally as pronounced, powerful and therapeutic as that of MDMA or 2C-B. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDAI experience and dominates the head space.
- [Acceleration of thought](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Acceleration_of_thought)
- [Mindfulness](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_effects:_Mindfulness)

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of MDAI only occur at higher dosages and are subtly psychedelic. These generally include:

- [Increased visual acuity](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Increased_visual_acuity)
- [Enhancement of colour](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Enhancement_of_colour)
- [Tracers](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Tracers)

**Physical Health Effects, Potential Addiction and Tolerance:**

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research, as they are able to replicate many of the effects of MDMA but without causing the neurotoxicity which may be associated with MDMA and some related drugs. No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.

There is currently no scientific data on the lethal dosage of MDAI within human beings but it is thought to be high in comparison to its active dosage. Due to its action as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, overdoses of this substance would likely result in acute or even fatal serotonin syndrome.

The tolerance to MDAI builds up with repeated usage in much the same way that MDMA does. There does not seem to be any addictive potential but long term usage could potentially lead onto it.

**Legal issues:**

MDAI is currently a legal grey area world wide and freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. This does not mean that you are guaranteed to be immune from legal prosecution should you be found in possession of this substance as it is likely to vary from country to country.

**Conclusion:**

In conclusion, MDAI is an extremely interesting alternative to MDMA due to its lack of neurotoxic effects and minimal dopamine reuptake inhibition. I would suggest this compound to anybody who wishes to experience the profound therapeutic entactogenic effects of MDMA without the stimulation or neurotoxicity. I would recommend the use of 5-HTP serotonin supplements the day after heavy MDAI usage to further mitigate its unlikely adverse effects .

## Subjective Experience

As MDAI was my first ever research chemical, it will forever hold a special place in
my heart. Purchased from a well known head shop, it came as 100mg of powder,
tucked away within a gelatine capsule.

These were naive and reckless days, and at the time I had little grasp of what to
expect, other than some sort of pleasant experience. Fortunately, in terms of relative
risk, MDAI is not particularly problematic, so I had chosen to dip my toe into fairly
benign waters.

I dosed small: perhaps half a capsule. It was mild and it was indeed pleasant, albeit
in a non-intrusive and generally weak way. I had, of course, barely reached threshold.
However, I gained confidence from the exercise: I had taken an RC, survived, and
actually enjoyed it, albeit superficially.

Life continued, but I still had another 100mg capsule burning a proverbial hole in my
drawer. I had binned the rest of the first capsule.

The day came upon which I finally decided to try the full monty. Down the hatch it
went, and I waited in some trepidation.

This was a significantly stronger experience. After an hour or so I felt a very nice
uplift, with yes, an empathogenic edge. I felt good.

Shortly thereafter, I recall walking to a takeaway for some food. Sitting across from
me, as I waited, was a woman: a stunning woman, possibly the most beautiful
woman I had ever seen. I was well aware that this must be a bi-product of the MDAI,
as I tried not to stare.

This took me by surprise. Can drugs really do this? Indeed they can, and I liked the
feeling.

Over the following months I bought and consumed a couple more capsules, but then,
suddenly, the head shop had no more: apparently there was a problem with
manufacture in India. Instead, I was offered a branded product called Sparkle-E,
which included MDAI, and was claimed by the vendor to be a good substitute.

The other ingredient was in fact Methiopropamine (MPA), which consequently
became my first research chemical stimulant.

As the MDAI shortage took hold, Sparkle-E soon became MPA + 5-MEO-DALT; as
was the world of branded legal highs. This, of course, is another story.

Downstream, circa 2015, MDAI re-emerged via a new lab, allegedly in China. As is
frequently the way with such chemicals, in terms of effect it never again seemed to
reach the wonderful high of those first few experiments. Somehow, whether
perceptually or in reality, the body appears to adjust and move on, beyond what one
could attribute to tolerance.

The magic dissipated, but the memory remained.

**5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane** (also known as **MDAI** ) is a lesser-known novel [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [aminoindane](/w/index.php?title=Aminoindane&action=edit&redlink=1) class. It acts as a putatively non-neurotoxic and highly selective [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) (SSRA) with neglible effects on [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) .

MDAI was developed by the American medicinal chemist and pharmacologist [David E. Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) during the 1990s at Purdue University. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] in the 2010s, MDAI was marketed alongside novel [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [5-MAPB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MAPB) , [5-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-APB) , and [6-APB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/6-APB) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) in the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. It is currently being investigated as a potential alternative to traditional entactogens in the treatment of mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [enhanced empathy and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It has been described as producing the non-stimulating effects of prototypical entactogens like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) . It has been suggested that the lack of dopamine and norepinephrine activity limits its ability to produce overtly invigorating, prosocial or [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) effects but with the benefit of decreased neurotoxicity and side-effects. However, more research is required to validate these claims.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MDAI, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

MDAI, or 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane, is a synthetic molecule of the [aminoindane](/w/index.php?title=Aminoindane&action=edit&redlink=1) class with structural similarity to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . It features the R 3 terminal carbon of the propane chain of amphetamine bound to the benzene ring. This creates an indane group, a bicyclic moeity containing a benzene ring fused to a pentane ring. MDAI contains an amino group NH 2 bound to R 2 of the indane ring. MDAI also contains two oxygen substitutions at R 5 and R 6 joined by a methylene bridge to form a methylenedioxy group.

MDAI is structurally related to [2-AI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-AI) , differing by a methylenedioxy ring.

## Pharmacology

MDAI has been shown to [inhibit the reuptake](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and has a selective affinity for the serotonin [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . Studies have shown that the brains of animals treated with MDAI have greater extracellular concentrations of [monoamine neural transmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) , most significantly [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

For comparison, MDAI is similar in potency with releasing serotonin to [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , but significantly less potent than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . This is done by inhibiting the reuptake and reabsorption of the neurotransmitters after they have performed their function of transmitting a neural impulse, essentially allowing them to accumulate, be reused and cause [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - The largest reported difference between MDAI and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) is that MDAI primarily results in moderate sedation and can therefore discourage physical activities such as running, dancing or climbing.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDAI can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric, soft and warm tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDAI. This effect is a product of an increased heart rate and an extreme motivation to engage in strenuous physical activities. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been a number of users suffering from [water intoxication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking, so it is advised that users simply sip at water and never over-drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Much like MDMA, higher doses of MDAI result in difficulty urinating. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is most likely due to the promotion of the release of [anti-diuretic hormone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasopressin) (ADH), which is the mechanism responsible for this side effect within MDMA. Anti-diuretic hormone is responsible for regulating urination. Difficulty urinating can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow. Some have reported that simply listening to the sound of running water also helps (such as a tap/faucet).
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of MDAI only occur at higher doses and are reported to be only subtly psychedelic in nature. These generally include: 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of MDAI can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of MDAI is described by many as one of euphoria and feelings of love or empathy. It contains a number of typical [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDAI and are a direct result of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) release.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is not as pronounced, powerful and therapeutic as that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDAI experience and dominates the head space.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDAI](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDAI.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research as they are able to replicate many of the effects of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but without causing the associated [neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) . No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.

There is currently no scientific data on the lethal dose of MDAI in humans and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. Due to its action as a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , overdoses of this substance would likely result in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, MDAI can be considered somewhat habit-forming with a low potential for abuse and is unlikely to be capable of causing psychological dependence among most users. This is because unlike traditional stimulants, MDAI does not increase concentrations of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) . If addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MDAI develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption).

MDAI presents cross-tolerance with all [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , meaning that after the consumption of MDAI all serotonergic [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDAI should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDAI may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart to a dangerous degree.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDAI*

MDAI, also known as 5,6-methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane, is an entactogen of the 2-aminoindane family which is related to MDMA and produces similar subjective effects.
It acts as a selective serotonin and norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA). The drug shows greatly reduced serotonergic neurotoxicity in comparison to MDMA in animals, although it still shows weak capacity for neurotoxicity with chronic use or in combination with amphetamine.
MDAI was developed in the 1990s by a team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. It has been encountered as a designer drug and has been used recreationally with reported street names such as "sparkle" and "mindy". In addition to its recreational use, there has been interest in MDAI for potential use in medicine, for instance in drug-assisted psychotherapy.

## Use and effects

A 2024 study compared the effects of MDAI and MDMA in humans. It found that MDAI produced comparable and very similar subjective effects to those of MDMA. This included pleasurable drug effects, drug liking, stimulation, happiness, openness, trust, and closeness. In addition, it included sense of well-being, emotional excitation, and extroversion, but not general activity or concentration, a profile of effects described as similar to that of MDMA. Other effects included a blissful state, experience of unity, and changed meaning of percepts, also described as comparable to MDMA. The effects of MDAI were slightly greater than those of 75 mg MDMA and slightly lower than those of 125 mg MDMA. At the employed dose of 3.0 mg/kg, with 125 mg MDMA corresponding to 1.9 mg/kg, it was estimated that MDAI had about 60% of MDMA's potency in producing comparable psychoactive effects (hence, roughly 200 mg MDAI would be similar to 125 mg MDMA). Aside from subjective effects, MDAI also increased blood pressure, cortisol levels, and prolactin levels similarly to MDMA. Conversely, it did not increase heart rate or body temperature.

## Toxicity

Very high doses can be fatal in rats with a 50% fatality rate for those subcutaneously injected with 28 mg/kg of MDAI. This is a result of the way serotonin release interferes with thermoregulation.
MDAI is only non-neurotoxic in isolation but may become neurotoxic when mixed with other drugs. Three deaths were linked to MDAI use in the United Kingdom during 2011 and 2012, all involving symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome. Two of these also involved other drugs while one death appeared to be from MDAI alone.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MDAI acts as a selective and well-balanced serotonin and norepinephrine releasing agent (SNRA) with much less (~10-fold lower) effect on dopamine release. In addition to inducing the release of the monoamine neurotransmitters, MDAI also inhibits their reuptake. For comparison to MDAI, MDA and MDMA are well-balanced releasing agents of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (SNDRAs). Conversely, the profile of monoamine release with MDAI is very similar to that of (R)-MDMA (levo-MDMA), which like MDAI is also a well-balanced SNRA with about 10-fold reduced impact on dopamine release, though MDAI is several-fold more potent than (R)-MDMA in vitro.
In contrast to MDMA, MDAI shows no affinity for any of the serotonin receptors (Ki = all >10 μM). This notably includes the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, which is implicated in producing psychedelic effects, and the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, which is implicated in causing cardiac valvulopathy. However, MDAI shows significant affinity for all three of the α2-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 322 to 1121 nM).

The family of drugs typified by MDMA produce their effects through multiple mechanisms of action in the body, and consequently produce three distinct cues which animals can be trained to respond to: a stimulant cue typified by drugs such as methamphetamine, a psychedelic cue typified by drugs such as LSD and DOM, and an "entactogen-like" cue which is produced by drugs such as MDAI and MBDB. These drugs cause drug-appropriate responses in animals trained to recognize the effects of MDMA, but do not produce responses in animals trained selectively to respond to stimulants or hallucinogens. Because these compounds selectively release serotonin in the brain but have little effect on dopamine or noradrenaline levels, they can produce empathogenic effects but without any stimulant action, instead being somewhat sedating.
MDAI shows substantially lower serotonergic neurotoxicity than MDMA in animals and has been described as a "non-neurotoxic" analogue of MDMA. However, MDAI still shows weak serotonergic neurotoxicity both alone and particularly in combination with amphetamine in animals. As such, MDAI does not appear to be a fully non-neurotoxic alternative to MDMA.

### Pharmacokinetics

The duration of MDAI in humans appears to be similar to that of MDMA at 2 to 5 hours or up to around 6 hours.

## Chemistry

MDAI is a substituted 2-aminoindane. The chemical structure of MDAI is indirectly derived from that of the illicit drug MDA, but the α-methyl group of the alkyl amino amphetamine side chain has been bound back to the benzene nucleus to form an indane ring system, which changes its pharmacological properties substantially.

### Synthesis

MDAI can be produced from 3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propionic acid which is converted to the acid chloride and then heated to produce 5,6-methylenedioxy-1-indanone.  Treatment of the indanone with amyl nitrite in methanol with HCl afforded the hydroxyimino ketone. This is reduced to the 2-aminoindan following a modification of Nichols' earlier method from a paper discussing DOM analogues, using a Pd/C catalyst in glacial acetic acid with catalytic H2SO4.

### Analogues

Analogues of MDAI include 2-aminoindane (2-AI), NM-2-AI, MDMAI, MEAI (5-MeO-2-AI), MMAI, and 5-IAI, among others.

## History

MDAI was first described in the scientific literature by David E. Nichols and colleagues at Purdue University in 1989.

## Society and culture

### Recreational use

MDAI has been advertised as a designer drug. It started to be sold online from around 2007, but reached peak popularity between about 2010 to 2012, after bans on mephedrone came into effect in various countries. Many internet-sourced products claimed to be MDAI have been shown to contain mephedrone or other cathinones, while generally containing no MDAI. The number of internet searches for MDAI has been considerably higher in the United Kingdom compared to Germany and the United States.

### Legal Status

#### China

As of October 2015 MDAI is a controlled substance in China.

#### Denmark

MDAI is illegal in Denmark as of September 2015.

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Switzerland

As of December 2011 MDAI is a controlled substance in Switzerland.

## Research

MDAI and other similar drugs have been widely used in scientific research, as they are able to replicate many of the effects of MDMA, but without causing the serotonergic neurotoxicity associated with MDMA and certain related drugs. No tests have been performed on cardiovascular toxicity.
