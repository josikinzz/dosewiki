DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of ethylcathinone are milder and often compared to those of 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), MDMA, MBDB, bk-MDMA (methylone), cocaine, methamphetamine and other euphoric stimulants. 
 
 Ethcathinone does not include substantial psychedelic visual effects. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 As with other psychoactives, oral ethylcathinone ingestion takes slightly longer to cause effects and lasts longer. Insufflation (snorting) is more associated with compulsive / addictive use patterns. Smoking ethylcathinone is not commonly reported. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 While it is unlikely to be physically addictive, meaning that withdrawal symptoms are minimal and likely not life-threatening, psychological addiction in some users seems possible with this substance, given that its effects profile is similar to that of other recreational euphoric stimulants.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[100 mg to 200 mg, oral] "At first a dose of 100mg would have no discernable effect on me but now that I am a bit more familiar with it I do notice a small amount of stimulation, even a mild euphoria, at this dose. It is pleasant and makes me slightly more talkative, focused, etc. At about 200mg orally it feels like a classic stimulant. Urge to talk, excitation, euphoria, stimulation, and of course anorexia, muscle tension, teeth grinding etc." -- [Exp 70604](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=70604)
 
[100 mg oral] "T+0:40 - I'm expecting it to hit me already, but nothing is happening 
 T+1:20 - Still nothing happening except for stronger pulse 
 T+1:40 - Chatting with friend who dosed the same amount at the same time as me - we decide to draw a line 
 T+1:50 - Slightly stimulated 
 T+2:00 - Pulse rate increases, music sounds slightly better" -- [Exp 93198](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=93198)
 
[30 mg insufflated] "My hair at my arms stand right up and I get Goosebumps from time to time. It is all in all very promising. It reminds me of very good coke. My dick has shrunken into a little, depressing piece of meat, although I'm horny. Euphoria kicks in now and it feels really nice." -- [Exp 69297](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=69297)

DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**Ethylcathinone Dosages**
**Oral**
**( very tentative )**
- Threshold: 30 - 50 mg
- Light: 50 - 100 mg
- Common: 100 - 200 mg
- Strong: 150 - 300+ mg
 
**Ethylcathinone Dosages**
**Insufflated (Snorted)**
**( very tentative )**
- Threshold: 5 - 20 mg
- Light: 15 - 35 mg
- Common: 35 - 75 mg
- Strong: 75 - 125+ mg
 
Ethylcathinone is a stimulant with empathogenic qualities. As of 2012, it is most often found as a powder.
 
NOTES #
 
Reports related to ethylcathinone use are uncommon, however, available data suggests similarities with other substituted cathinones: use may often involve redosing ("boosting" / "bumping") multiple times. Users sometimes mix oral and insufflated, taking some ethylcathinone orally, then insufflating some, then taking more orally. Because of the common desire to recapture the pleasurable initial high, redoses are sometimes higher than the initial dose or are spaced closely together in time. Many users report having difficulty not redosing after using a strong dose if more ethylcathinone is available when they are starting to come down. Experience reports in which users find themselves unexpectedly consuming a gram or more of ethylcathinone are common.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical. 
 
 Erowid's dosage information is a summary of data gathered from users, research, and other resources. This information is intended to describe the range of dosages people report using. It should not be construed as a recommendation of any sort. Individuals can respond very differently to the same dosage. What is safe for one can be deadly for another.

**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Ethylcathinone**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Possible Analog
 
Ethylcathinone is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog of a scheduled substance, in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) though we are unaware of any such existing cases (Mar 03 2008).

INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
China #
 
Controlled in China as a Category I psychotropic substance, illegal to sell, buy, import, export, and manufacture 4-methylmethcathinone as of September 2010. See [China's SFDA announcement](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/countries/china/china_law_2015_09_27_list_of_newly_controlled_chemicals.pdf) . (thanks n) (last updated Nov 25, 2015)
 
Canada #
 
Ethylcathinone is not currently scheduled in Canada. However, because Canada has an "analogue" rule, it is possible that ethylcathinone could be considered a controlled analog of a controlled substance and thus controlled itself. Health Canada has made unofficial statements that indicate they consider cathinone-based structures to be analogs of amphetamines. See [http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/definitions.php?structure=C](http://isomerdesign.com/Cdsa/definitions.php?structure=C) and [http://www.rechem.ca/index.php?_a=viewCat&catId=12](http://www.rechem.ca/index.php?_a=viewCat&catId=12) . (thanks m) (last updated Aug 6, 2014)
 
Denmark #
 
Denmark's Minister for Health and Prevention Jakob Axel Nielsen banned "mephedrone", "flephedrone" and ethylcathinone on Dec 18, 2008. (thanks Abrad; from [Ministry of Health and Prevention press release](http://www.sum.dk/sum/site.aspx?p=23&t=visartikel&Articleid=4728) )
 
Israel #
 
In December 2007, N-ethylcathinone was added to Israel's list of controlled substances, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess. (thanks A)
