**Welcome to the Big & Dandy Nitrous Oxide Thread - Part 2**


**JUST SAY N2O !**

​

Carry on the usual discussion here about nitrous oxide, N2O, whippits, hippy crack, laughing gas HAHAHHAHAHAHA ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) , nitrous, nos, noz, schnozz, the schnazzzzle at the nozzle.

Wiki says:


> Nitrous oxide, commonly known as laughing gas or sweet air, is a chemical compound with the formula N2O. It is an oxide of nitrogen. At room temperature, it is a colorless, non-flammable gas, with a slightly sweet odor and taste. It is used in surgery and dentistry for its anesthetic and analgesic effects. It is known as "laughing gas" due to the euphoric effects of inhaling it, a property that has led to its recreational use as a dissociative anesthetic

Lol, I love the framed picture! Yea, nitrous is one of my top 5 substances. Nothing like vegging with some movies and balloons..very safe profile, fun, fun, fun, good mystical experiences from time to time, combines well with pretty much anything (mxe, 2c-x, my fave) , reverse tolerance, I mean it gets better every session I have with it..maybe a case or two every 2-3 months. 

Only complaints, bit of a headache here and there, maybe some nausea if really hitting it.

My fiancee doesn't like it, she says all it does it make everything go "wah-wah-wah" lol, more for me! She was on the phone with the pizza shop and I just did a balloon and i couldn't resist to yell out "don't forget the extra wah-wah-wah" I found it really, really hilarious, unfortunately, she did not. She hasn't had much humour lately due to unemployment.

Ah yeah I can understand that, though often if people are honest it's money that's lacking, not the job that was making you happy. I say often. Of course there are also plenty of people who love their jobs.

Anyway I did plenty of nitrous during my tripping/partying heydays but not an insane or unhealthy amount I think. Yet I have had hypoxia from doing it, I may have a little apneu that perhaps made that more likely to happen. But your suggestion of combining with MXE, 2C-X and having a safe profile I just have to say: it's not really that safe either.

I started avoiding it after multiple 'bad incidents' that were not just psychologically negative experiences but thing like seizure/epileptiform attacks in me and a friend. I got a type of fit I still cannot typify or diagnose but it caused my entire body to become rigid and stiff as a board. I mean extremely, like feeling like tensing or arching the back to one way or the other almost snapping the spine (figuratively, but still). It felt medically serious, not at all like an ego-death. More like the "peaking" effect was just creating brain overactivity like a thunderstorm.


It was unfortunate I didn't feel like it was responsible anymore because it has also given me the absolute sickest in the sense of *cool*est mindfuck effects. Like experiencing everything happening in reverse, as if a button has been pressed on a VCR, but while still being able to move and act 360 degrees freely. I remember experiencing like surfing synaesthetic waves of music, also quite often the inversion of colors like someone temporarily shifted the "hue" function in photoshop... that's classic.


I wouldn't say no to a tank of medical nitrous... lol!

Have tried with both MDMA and 6-APB. Have yet to experience the full effects. Have a nesting / NOS experienced planned in the next few weeks. I'm told I'm in for a very interesting time ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

To experience nitrous to its fullest extent, you must combine it with a psychedelic substance. Be it LSD, mushrooms, 2C-whatever etc. Also can be amazing on dissociatives such as MXE was very intense for me. Nitrous on psychedelics can be beautiful, but must be treated with respect as it can be a sinister ego shattering experience.


I have come across something of a realisation recently though. That the nitrous trip is actually quite fickle and temperamental. It is also unpredictable but at the same time predictable, a paradox that I still don't understand, and from what I've read many people spend years trying to find out 'what it means' etc etc. Of course it's simply a delusion, but I find it can be so lucid and mind blowing it's hard to believe what's happening is possible at all!


Recently I was tripping on 25I-Nbome and had some of the most intense nitrous trips ever, very hard to describe but anyone who has done nitrous with psychedelics will know what I mean, you can get a kind of underlying theme to the trips in that session. Somehow the trips with 25I had a almost feminine or even feline quality. The way the music and sound changed, the visual element, very strange indeed. But also frustrating at times. The nitrous can be choosy about what music it likes and will let you trip to. In the end I turned the music off and tried it without. 'They' told me to switch it back on. I had some extra surreal hallucinations at this point. And then got stuck in a thought loop for the next two hours. Basically I felt that the nitrous had actually spoiled the trip all in all, and next time I trip I intend to not have any nitrous around.

Fantastic description. Trips really do have an organic quality to them. They have a life of their own.

**N2O assistance**


hello amigos,


just joined the forum and i have a question. a friend got some n2o in those whip cream can chargers from a kitchen supply store and isnt sure how to use them for a sess, so im tryin to help hehe. i read the big n2o faq on this website but im still pretty confused 8(

the little cannisters dont have a nozzle or valve at the end for one to be able to release the contents in a balloon, so how does one go about doing this?


i initially thought all cannisters came with that little valve thing at the end or else how can it dispense its contents? well anyway since im confuzzled i'd love some help from a bright soul around here


much appreciated

dispenser or cracker, pretty sure it mentions that in the faq


A pin breaks the seal on the charger, releasing the gas due to the high pressure difference and from there into a balloon. Personally use a dispenser.

Like others have said you need a cracker or soda syphon. What ever you do don't try to make some home made device to crack them, that will end badly.

Bottles from the store of valerian root/5-htp make nitrous more worthwhile on its own for cheap. Valerian root prevents the uptake of GABA from the nitrous, and the serotonin potentates...just a heads up if yer not tripping

Google is your friend. the questions you're asking are very readily available.


the cartrigde is just a gas container. you put it into a whipcream maker that punctures it to pressurize the cream for dispensing.


to get just the gas, obviously dont add creme.

Believe me, you want a dispenser but it *is possible* to use without one... If you don't mind risking fingers and potential explosions and the old AnE trip.


Whack the charger into a fairly heavy duty balloon and hit the tip as hard as you can on the edge of a wall or desk or something that won't break. It has to be small enough though to hit the pin thing. What will happen now is the gas escapes and the charger freezes over. You now have frost burns on your fingers, unless you let go where then you probably have a broken balloon and a wonderful nitrous balloon. 


I seriously recommend against doing this, having learnt from experience. Frost burns covering the palm of your hand are not something you want at all, nor are imploding chargers.

We're all fucking idiots at some point eh?

**is this method of inhaling Nitrous safe?**


i've found a fun way to take them when i've been smoking. i usually empty one charger into my dispenser and inhale half then exhale, take a couple breaths, then inhale the rest right away.

then breath a couple normal breaths, reload. wait a few seconds and hit it the same way.

then get more oxygen (about 5 breaths) then load and hit it again.

i'll do this for about 10 whippets, taking more oxygen between each whippet.

i try to make it a continual nitrous ride by hitting right when i start to come down, except the first few, i'll hit during the previous plateau.

think i'm getting enough oxygen? i don't wanna suffocate lol


also, i can't tell if i am having headaches from weed or what, i did 24 whippets two days ago but i've also been smoking a lot more than normal. nitrous headaches or weed headaches? lol. still have a litt nausea

I usually get a headache after using a good amount of Nitrous.  Its because your hurting your brain by depriving it off oxygen.  Coming from a dude that has done Nitrous for the last 8 years   Make sure you space it out to once or twice a month.  And longer in between as you grow older.  basically just be safe  Dont end up passing out and cracking your head on a dresser or something.   That being said I love Nitrous   just dont do it like I used too.

Been at least 10 years since I last did nitrous, but I've solo downed a 20# tank a handful of times and never got headaches.  I did, however, get incredibly sick for days afterwards almost every time I did too much, too quickly.

so.... doing ~20 a week would be too much?? i dont do it balloon style, like i said in the op, i do it with a cream dispenser/cracker thing. i also exercise a lot and take b12 and have a good diet. 

i don't see it being too much of a problem if i get enough oxygen

yeah with the oxygen it should be fine. I wouldn't suggest trying to make it "ride" for more then 3 cartridges worth though. vitamin B is a big thing too ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

The fact that you are taking breaths in between is a very good idea. The big problem is when people starve their brain of oxygen by taking repeated hits of pure nitrous. Try even opening your mouth a little bit when you start taking your whip to take in oxygen at the same time you are inhaling it and it may be even healthier. Still it is not too healthy to use whippets especially when it is not medical grade.

i supplement vitamin b12 2 times a day and a multi every day (i lift weights) i think taking it before hand i should be good when it comes to the vit b12


and thanks for the suggestion. i ALWAYS smoke when i do nitrous. like, i'll usually smoke till the point of being completely gone, then hit it. 

i was recently trying to decide, though, is i either want to do:

dxm, weed, nitrous hits

or

shrooms, weed, nitrous hits


i have done dxm before, but neve shrooms, so i feel comfy with smoking and hitting n2o on the dxm, i'm skeptical about the shrooms though, what should i start with? any general advice?

Don't be afraid with shrooms they are fun guys! Although don't take them lightly as they might play a little to rough for ya if you bring too many around. Just get 1/8 an oz (3.5-4 grams) and just slowly eat as much of it as you want over the night. Maybe start with a half eighth if you are nervous and give it 60-90 minutes to take effect before deciding to eat more.


The dose is not as important as preparing mentally and physically for it as well as having the right space and the right people around. I definitively recommend someone who is experienced to either trip sit or use a dose they know they can handle up to an eighth to share in the experience with you.


Also read some experience reports to give a feel of what to expect, but don't let your expectations dictate your trip. Let whatever comes in and whenever it wants to leave let it go and appreciate what it was and you will probably end up with a powerful new spiritual friend in life that you know grows through the earth balancing our ecosystem and providing us with health and knowledge.


Also try it without anything else that is CNS active except cannabis for the first time. Most importantly have fun with it as well as being safe.

awesome. ive had the connect for a while, but i just wanted to wait until i wasnt anxious/too excited to do them. i am in a very happy point in life, and i am full of confidence. i will be doing them with my brother (he took 4 grams his first time). we like the same kind of music, so we will be listening to some house and trance. he has a big screen tv that he hooks his desktop up to, so we are gonna play music in window media player and have those weird graphic things set on random so we can watch all the cool colors and stuff. 

i've tripped at his house before on other things (dxm, dph, dxm/dph combo, ket) so i def feel comfy there.


lol just thinking about it makes me happy i'm so excited. lol.

^Doing nitrous on mushrooms is sort of like moving into a heavy dosage for 60 seconds. But at the same time, it sorta gives you a mental and physical break from the tripping, and pushes you into a new direction, and gives you control of what's going on (kills thought loops). The visuals are usually enhanced for awhile after some whippits as well. 


I'd say go for it if you want, but it's usually best to try a new drug by itself first, so you get to experience what it is truly like.

So I have a new respect for nitrous after last night... I was at this desert party and took a balloon after a couple bumps of ketamine, holy shit. Complete dissociation and the wah-wah's weren't annoying as I remember them last time. The music also helped create some crazy experiences when I timed it at the drop (deep tech house)

Holy ball sacks.  I had never tried nitrous before, but after dosing 1.5mg of 25i and taking whip its during the peak, I'm convinced.  Nitrous combined with a psychedelic is the best thing ever lol.

A cocktail of drugs + Music Festival in the mountains+ Lots of Nitrous+ Loud awesome music you can hear because your camped right next to the late night stage= God Damn.  I could literally feel the music pore into my face and go through my body  One the most intense high's of my quarter of a century life span.  Def. not beginner shit.  


For illustrative purposes the cocktail consisted of A quarter of mushies  3 - 20 mg adderal's around a half gram of BK MDMA  a few good size bumps of some bomb K  lots of corn whiskey and a 24 pack of nitrous basically to my self   and all on about 4 hours give or take of sleep the night before.  


Anyways Nitrous is awesome but  it takes a big toll after a while    One time the whoomp whoomps didnt go away  for about an hour.  I was scared that I was gonna be stuck like that forever.  It went away        morel of the story  Moderation of Nitrous is Crucial for your health  BE Safe

Hi all, i'm looking for information that may already be on this site and i can't find it.


I think that moderate, safe use of nitrous is harmless and lots of fun. I am teetering in the line of use and abuse right now.


I have read posts here that refer to addiction and compulsive use withdrawal but not a lot of information about these in a nuts and bolts of it kind of way.


This thread looks like more for those still on the safe use side of the line. If there is a thread specific to, the compulsive use of and addiction to, nitrous please mssg me or post. If there is not such a thread I'd like to start one.

I don't expect so really, maybe a little better purity. Ever looked inside a really used nos balloon and seen all that white stuff? Think, that could be going into your lungs especially if you're breathing in and out of the balloon. Can't comment on the more expensive ones though

That white stuff could be talc. It's commonly used to prevent the insides of balloons from sticking together, kind of a lubricant. Balloons should therefore be washed out with clean water prior to nitrous re(inhalation). Getting talc into your lungs is considered harmful, it can lead to severe pulmonary issues like talcosis, pneumonia, perhaps cancer.

Ok here's my experiences and current problem and questions about nitrous.


I was introduced to "hippie crack" about 20 years ago at concerts where i could buy big balloons from tanks and stumble around or sit and enjoy the hallucinatory effects on top of whatever combination of LSD/shrooms and pot i would be on at said concerts at the time. I loved the head rush and the accentuation of hallucinations, especially the auditory.still do.


Thorough my 20s and 30s i would from time to time buy a whip dispenser and a few boxes of chargers and trip out with friends. Invariably losing the charger and in interest in nitrous quickly. Then revisit it later.  


I do on average 200-300 whippets daily. This stated in the dozens about 4 months ago and has been steadily increasing since. This is the current amount administrated from a whip dispenser, no balloon. I inhale the gas about 80% lung capacity and inhale and exhale the other 20% capacity through the nose for oxygen. I use in a well ventilated area. I take 10-15k mcgs  of b12 orally daily and most days have multiple hours of fresh air and sun out of my pad . I am now getting weekly shots of b12.


Recently my tolerance to the gas and compulsion to use have gone up dramatically. I have also begun feeling physical withdrawal symptoms from it and I thought this to be impossible. I am keeping my mind open to the symptoms being psychosomatic but I never experienced physical withdrawal like this from drugs i wasn't supposed to and expected to. eg. opiates, alcohol  


The symptoms are mild in comparison to I've felt from other drugs. I feel something like very mild junksick coupled with agitation. It almost feels pointless to state the cravings are maddening. these I give into and have not tested a full on detox for more than 24 hours and have no idea what o expect.


some of my questions and in further posts i'm sure i'll come up with more..


i've read nothing concrete about nitrous withdrawal, any recommended readings would be appreciated. I don't want to read long "feelings" stuff. I have experienced bad withdrawal from the above mentioned and benzos so I don't need long descriptions, just known facts please.


Could this have anything to do with my active dr prescribed benzo addiction or inactive opiate addiction (over 10years without) are my GABA receptors freaking out?


what's this I hear regarding strokes/paralysis/death from heavy use.. i'm curious, just the facts please. I am already aware of oxygen deprivation related unpleasantness. 


I hate the balloon. To inefficient and i'm careful not to freeze or explode my lungs. Is there any other reason?


I would like to know what point is the part of nitrous that gets me high absorbed into my lungs and what I exhale that is all gone. or is there some reason i can't use the same balloon forever?


The positives that is that I enjoy is the experience  I know I have to stop at least for now but not quite sure what the best approach is.Still fence sitting and enjoying the buzz.

ham reduction tips to others. I wish I had more to offer. I know a fair bit about harm reduction. It is a big part of what I do for a living but I have never encountered nitrous addiction and know of no strong evidence about it.


don't do what I describe above, it is dangerous and can kill you or cause permanent damage to yourself in lots of different ways.


always use a balloon. I read some good tip around her to the effect that if you are to messed to hold a balloon you let go. Causing hypothermia by excessive freezing or causing ruptures to your lungs by to much pressure is not good.

this is helpful reading to all. I do question the author's use of anecdotal shock evidence though. That's a good part of how the war on drugs was propagated in the 80's under the Reagan's..

Just waiting to come up on the shrooms I've just munched and looking forward to mixing a little nitrous into the mix soon. It's one of my favourite combinations! Man some of the stuff I've seen before on these is just mind blowing. It can be super intense, like the line between what's real and what isn't is very small indeed. Full on visual and audio hallucinations galore. Tick tock lol

Hi all. Ok no response to my questions. Probably because they are buried in way to long a post. I'll try t be more succinct


Question 1.and 2.Given the daily use I am currently at, am I taking enough b12? What damage am I doing that could be caused by lack of b12? 

I am aware of potential nerve damage form the beautiful souls that try to help us when we ask pleading ignorance and need.


I am taking close to 50000 mcg b12 orally per day, gradually throughout. Also by doc gives me im shots, 10,000 once a week. I always feel a lot better for at least a day, sometimes 48 hours after. I have been getting the tingly feelings since I started using nitrous regularly They have subsided in intensity since I started with the b12 shots and continuously b12 greatly.

My doc is not concerned except for the compulsive use. At this time given lack of evidence of any evidence that she is aware of, other than anecdotal,. Granted she doesn't know the amounts I am at now.


Question 3. I am not using medical grade and no balloon. What, other than frost bite or pressure wounds on my lungs are ther


Question. 4. I am experiencing what I think, are physical withdrawal symptoms when I don't use. How could this be from a non physically addictive substance?


I have come off many things physically addictive and not after compulsive use. Cocaine for example. Lots of crazy cravings but no minor "junk sick" like symptoms  I experience these days from nitrous.


Question 5. I would like to know if a medical detox might be necessary. 


I am currently off work due to stress leave (can ya tell![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

^ stay strong man. addiction to nitrous is real, and is documented in various places. As far as your lungs, if you're not using oxygen you are basically experiencing voluntary hypoxia. There is not enough oxygen in your blood and thus irreversible brain damage could be done. It's well and good you're taking b12, but what should really be done is lower the amount of nitrous you are using...


I'm not sure if you are aware of a class of drugs called 'nootropics'. One in particluar, noopept, makes it nigh impossible to get high in nitrous. This could be of help, perhaps? Sort of like naltrexone for alcoholics.

Hello everyone.


So what is the recommended number of whippets per session in your opinion?  I want to stay safe and don't want to overdo it, but it is hard to stop as you know.


I've been doing 12-24 whippets (into balloons) per session, and one session every two weeks or so.  Taking multi-vitamins most days.  Just wondering whether it is safe to do more per session, or should I cut down.


Thank you.

I just did five whippits back to back and tasted DMT. Anyone else experience this phenomenon?

For me, the magic number is 50. Anything less, or anything more, mentally blue balls me...if that makes sense. more than 50 and I'll just want to go on forever. Less than 50 doesn't get me far enough. 


This is for wippits though, not tanks and festivals or whanot.

Goodness me, please be careful!


The body measures respiratory health by checking carbon dioxide levels in the blood because it's much easier than actually measuring oxygen levels. This was absolutely fine for the first few million years of our existence because all we had was air. Unfortunately that's no longer the case, which gives us an issue.


When one inhales nitrous they get no oxygen into the blood. Then they exhale again, breathing out the nitrous, oxygen and CO2 that was left over from the last breath. After a balloon this means you have way less oxygen than normal, but also less CO2 than normal. this means your body doesn't realise it's oxygen deficient and none of the defense mechanisms are activated.


This wouldn't really be a problem, except for the fact that nitrous is *really* moreish. When you do another balloon right after the first, you are once again purging CO2 from the blood without replenishing oxygen. It doesn't take long at all before there is not enough oxygen in the brain, which causes cells to die. While nitrous itself is very safe, I would not be surprised if it was one of the most damaging drugs we do because of the way we use it.

Ftr I always make sure to get oxygen into my lungs while I breathe nitrous. Breath both at the same time. But heres my question ; I don't hear any wah-wahs anymore. It doesn't matter how much I do. There is a slight buzzing but not the wobbly wah wahs. I really like that audio distortion part of nitrous but its gone. Why ? Have more people experienced this ?  Will it come back ?

It is an amazing combo that will do both. Nitrous usually goes well with most other drugs, especially LSD. but with weed its fucking awesome too, the nitrous high is much better and longer imo than doing nitrous sober.

Nitrous, in combination with cannabis, mdma, and stimulants on varied occasions changed my spiritual outlook; if you write right after your experience, you can retain more of your insights, and retention of insights can reduce compulsive use of the drug.  No longer will you be chasing the "oh, I've got it now!" feeling to the same extent.

...

If you're using enough nitrous to be worried about b-12 absorption and retention, you're using enough nitrous that you should worry about your psyche and personal relationships (not to mention your pocketbook).  That said, b vitamin supplementation pre and/or post-binge cant hurt.

Online I see they are about 45-75$ in a domestic (I am in Europe though) website and they are even overcharging. Why not find a (semi-pro) kitchen specialty store?


I wore out a ceramic whipped cream dispenser years ago and then bought an aluminum / stainless steel one. Haven't done it in years I think, but recently a friend of mine got cartridges so he got me a box as well.


Perhaps you are not using the right search words by the way. I imagine "cream gun" would get you more porn than whippets devices.

Hahahaha!!


Yeah the 160 dollar price tag was for a stainless steel one from a kitchen specialty store. I just ended up with 10 boxes (100 nangs) and don't want to wait for overseas shipping from ordering online. I think I'll try a few second hand stores (pawn shops) and see if I can get lucky there.

You can get a B12 supplement if you're worried, but if you only go on the occasional binge, then you should be getting enough from your diet.

One question, I've a cream siphon (whipet charger, NO cracker) and don't works now. It's like something obstruct the gas exit (n2o residue on mouthpiece??). I tried washing with warm and soapy water but it failed. Did you notice this on your whipper? Seems like accumulative residue of n2o or something and happened only after few boxes (maybe 100 total nitrous charges lifetime).

I don't think so....   look I know I have done it before and it makes your voice sound cool, and afer huffing a big baloon you get that waaaaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaa waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa noise along with what sounds like a conversation from an alternatre reality going on in your head and it seems very cool,  but from the outside looking at that, and being sober everyone seems idiotic.  People on LSD, Mushrooms, and E all make more sense to me then a person who is drunk and doing wippets.


but like I said that was when I was older/wiser watching others instead of indulging.  Don't get me wrong when I was 19 I was all about hitting a bong, and allowing a ballon to push the smoke through the pull out .....  the combination of a bong hit ( with good weed) and a balloon of NoS is prestty intense.

Maybe something like the valve got stuck from the temperature, or you're right it could be residue because I think that there is something like machine oil that may accumulate over time. Probably from manufacture. It may be innocuous when the chargers are used for their original purpose but inhalation could be an issue and so could malfunction of the dispenser. I never really heard much about the dirty stuff being mentioned IRL or online but I have no other explanation for the suspicious odor and precipitation.

Try a non-polar solvent to try and dissolve the oily stuff. If it doesn't work you may want to buy a repair kit to replace the sensitive parts, it should be considerably cheaper than full replacement.

How much does everyone else do nos? What would you call a binge? How often do you guys binge? How often do you think you should allow yourself to binge? If I'm binging ma friends and I do a box each (24) if we have that much probably about once a month. Although often, since I'm the one ordering 120 canisters and just have loads lying about, I'll end up having anywhere from 0-6 canister every day in the week leading up the binge. Dya guys think thats too much?

Amazon.com has good priced nitrous dispensers in all kinds of sizes/colors, screw paying a bill 60.


I love myself some nitrous while already on a psychedelic or mdma but i don't do it often probably 4 times a year and i go through around 10-30 chargers in a night. My favorite combo so far is Cubensis mushrooms+MDMA+Nitrous, very euphoric/trippy combo IME. I really like the dentist nitrous sessions to, like being on constant whip-it for about 30 minutes. i always keep telling them to turn it up more but they always look at me and say i think we are where we need to be while im sitting there drooling on myself haha.


I have been wanting to try MXE+Salvia+Nitrous for awhile now, i will probably do this soon i will comment back on how it goes for sure.

Just had a nitrous epiphany - not all balloons are that brilliant but every once in a while it is extra amazing IME.


What if the reason that elucidating nitrous oxide's mechanism of action is so elusive is that it does not actually have any typical pharmacological properties, but it permeates the body and the CNS nonetheless. I find that it seems like the awesome effects of nitrous mostly have to do with modulating or amplifying existing actions, especially those that are already being tweaked by other drugs, and most of all: feedback loops, that can result in effects like echo-reverberations or peak experiences from positively reinforcing loops.

Maybe nitrous changes binding interactions and the way it permeates the brain creates something like a diffraction difference, speeding up certain interactions and slowing down others, maybe only marginally - but possibly dose-dependent. By itself it could not really be detected or explained and it seems almost inert. The subtle physical phenomena are really beyond my understanding but I think that this kind of participation is where we need to look for effects.


(@freaktech: yes I have had reactions like that as well - you are not the only one, thanks for reminding me not to combine it with other, more serious, drugs anymore)

^^ I thought of that before as nitrous seems to intensify all drug effects I've perceived. I'm not so sure how strong its nmda antagonism is which is linked to tolerance reduction (I believe cigs work in a similar action being an maoi). so In effect, nitrous would temporarily reduce tolerance to a large degrees thus causing an increase in other drug effects. I'm not sure though, sounds more like ADD material.

Nitrous feels like the nmda activity is only a secondary effect. The unique euphoria, mental effects, and "wah-wah-wah" auditory effects don't seem to come from that pharmacological action. Other dissociatives (mxe, dxm, etc.) feel almost nothing like nitrous to me. Various other inhalant-type drugs produce the same effects but idk if they also target nmda.

Well, most drugs work by binding to receptors which is kind of like pushing a button or doorbell which can be done hard, subtly, long, briefly, etc... and depending on a lot of factors that may or may not result in activation / someone responding to the doorbell.

These receptors are arranged in a huge system, imagine a whole country with people pushing doorbells and telling a 'bit' of gossip when someone opens the door. Then in a lot of cases, when that gossip is spreaded it causes the receiver to push other doorbells to spread it even more, or prevent doorbells from being rang if the kind of person living in a certain house is generally against gossiping. There are also feedback loops, where groups of people may get 'riled up' over entering gossip or activity.

You must understand that this entire system is 'timed' in a certain way and the weird thing is that it is not so much the *content* of the gossip that matters but the activity itself, or the amount of gossip - which can come in spurts and certain patterns. These patterns, that can move through the system like waves are what emerge from a helicopter view perspective. Still with me?


Nitrous oxide in my theory is not like most other drugs something that when you put it in your brain starts ringing doorbells where people live that have a particular predisposition regarding gossip (which would change the patterns in a way that reflects this predisposition), but it may be pervasive - standing in front of a lot of different kinds of doorbells where different kinds of people live with different kinds of predisposition. The subtle interaction it may have there, such as putting a tiny bit of glue on doorbells or slippery wax or ice that makes your finger slide off, could change the atmosphere in the system/country in a major and general way. It can disrupt the pattern, because the uniform interaction at the doorbells normalize how the gossip moves. (I think considering the potential for seizures it is more likely that it acts like a little bit of glue at the doorbell.)

Feedback loops may not necessarily be amplified by this in a classical way but they could be "felt" as the nitrous moves through it, because depending on how much nitrous there is this feedback loop activity can be slightly changed which could reverberate throught the system like an echo. Which may not happen with other drugs because they don't work in such a pervasive and uniformly disruptive way. If other patterns are temporarily destabilized by the nitrous, then the feedback loop reverberations that are left over become so much more prominent - it could seem like that is all there is for a moment.

I mentioned the word diffraction because of another sort of metaphor: when light moves through matter into another sort of matter such as from water to air, or into a prism, it changes direction a bit depending on the wavelength. If the gossip/activity/information is imagined to travel with this light, breaking it with a prism is also a pervasive kind of change on another level than at the level of the information itself.


Sorry for mixing up metaphors and remember this is just an **idea** that popped into my head while under the influence of this stuff, and yes it is kind of ADD material, but who knows... I like that the idea can fit with the principles of feedback loops, the fact that the effects of nitrous are not well understood even though it is an extremely simple molecule and the possibility that something so simple could be that more universal / pervasive in it's actions.

I think I understand why doing balloons and inhaling+exhaling instead of just holding the gas inside the lungs is such a powerful experience! What if nitrous oxide somehow bestows the user with direct and spontaneous insight into pranayama technique and allows us to voice these meditative breathing techniques, keeping firm pressure on the lungs using the balloons as a closed circuit extension of our lungs?

Could be I am just hallucinating but it feels like there are deep vibrations in my breath accompanying my nitrous trips, and this seems kind of consistent.


Also I am now regularly experiencing effects that feel like asymptotic curves and functions that may be represented at different levels of the nervous system / brain. As if for example shivers run over my visual cortex centers and cause a color boost as a wave gliding over the visual spectrum as humans experience it. Similarly I think there are kinetic processes and feedback loops emphasized and echoed within the electromagnetic consciousness field. I know that sounds esoteric but I have no better way to describe it. :D

I've made some cool devices out of strong plastics to try to make sure the least amount of nitrous escaped. A blow up beach volleyball worked best(it was a huge one as well purchased for a few bucks on Ebay since it was winter where i'm at). I connected an oxygen mask to it and it was quite easy to inhale a few chargers, then exhale into the bag, take a couple more breaths from the bag, then close off the mask, and sit back in dissociated bliss. IDK why but balloons always seemed to lose a bit of the nitrous on each inhale, not to mention being harder to handle so I decided it was time for an upgrade.

I really can't manage nitrous, I've had few too many (sober) inexplicably-passing-out experiences which have usually been accompanied by lots of bizarre feelings beforehand, incredibly brief dreams/hallucinations, then highly anxious coming-round with worried people looking down at me.

As soon as I start to feel the nitrous build it feels just like that, I freak out and have to stop huffing.  I end up having had a very minor experience and dealing with considerable bodily anxiety.

Strangely I've never had this feeling with the come-on of DMT (5-meo or NN) which seems so warm and benign.


Also I've had some thoroughly dispiriting times watching friends fiend on nitrous, chasing the answer and chomping a big hole in what was otherwise a rewarding shared time.  That sort of compulsive behaviour is not something I like being around, especially when chemically enhanced!

This has been bugging me, so I felt compelled (more on this later) to return to this thread and outline my objections to nitrous more fully.

1. It seems too cheap and frivolous, disposable.  From the acquisition, to means of use, to the effects, to the rubbish of spent chargers and balloons.  I'm not some straight-faced Leary disciple who thinks that the use of substances should be reserved for serious people thinking serious thoughts, but nos seems the antithesis of profundity, a consumer experience.

2. The compulsive nature, quickly reducing (some/many) people to white mice chasing their tails for another bubble.  There's a sinister edge here, especially in those settings where it's being purchased one balloon at a time.  Again, consumerism tainting my freedom-trip.

3. It often seems to 'interrupt' whatever was happening before, and leaves a sense of 'what now?' afterwards.  I think this may be part of 2.


BUT why do I even care?  All I have to do is choose not to inhale any and the problem is solved!

I think the reason nitrous bothers me is because I find that I can't enjoy it, and *I* *feel left out*.

Everyone else seems to have access to this quick and easy entertainment but something in me prevents me from sharing that.  My own anxieties around exclusion and not being able to find enjoyment in the obvious things elevate this from just something I'm not into to a source of annoyance, anger even.

So in fact this ridiculous gas has enabled a decent psychedelic insight, without me even using it.


Truly a miraculous substance!

So I finally got around to trying this. Had two balloons. Absolutely lovely stuff, so euphoric and mellow. Totally not what I was expecting Nitrous to be like.


I'm under the impression I took what's considered a low dose though as I experienced little dissociated other than the room growing a little and hearing a sound like a quiet kettle in the ground going constantly.


Was a lovely treat though and I'd love to try it on another psychedelic or dissociative.

The only times I've ever done Nitrous have either been at the dentist's office or using a whip cream can, but I simply put the plastic end into my mouth and push down until the cream comes out and then I know I've used up the nitrous.  I've never used a balloon before.  


I have a few questions:


1) why are people asking how to use a cracker with a whip cream cannister?  Why don't they just inhale out of the can like I've always done?


Is there a reason why doing it that way is better?


Is there actually more nitrous in the whip cream can then I get out of it by inhaling out of the plastic?


2) is using a cracker and a balloon more intense or different in any way from simply inhaling out of the end of a whip cream container?


3) Someone said that Valerian root increases the intensity of Nitrous.  Is this true and if so, why exactly and in what way does it intensify the experience?


I don't consider nitrous to be very smart, I do it a couple times a year maybe if even that much at all, but having those long experience at the dentist's office while mixed with oxygen so it's safer are a lot of fun.


Wish I had the ability to occassionally do those long experiences without being in a dentist's office haha.

I think I was the one who said that. A lot of.things potentiate nitrous or rather vise versa. That's why I said valerian root. Many psycs are intensified or changed by nitrous, but valerian root potentiates nitrous the other way around. Valerian inhibits the uptake of GABA, as well as manipulates neurotransmitters, and nitrous acts by increasing GABA, and mixing the signal of things like dopamine/serotonin.

So in layman's terms, nitrous is made stronger by Valerian root?


That's cool, I'd like to try that.


What about the rest of my questions?


No one has answered those.

Odd combination perhaps, but I've never tried Kratom and might possibly buy some soon.


Has anyone experienced nitrous mixing well with Kratom or is this combo pretty much ineffective?


I'm also considering buying a cracker and some cartridges, but I don't do much nitrous, most people think it's ineffective on its own, and I'm not smoking weed or using other drugs right now.


Also, I've seemed to notice a lot of sites online don't usually sell the cracker and cartridges together, is this atypical?

ebay has the best prices on that stuff especially if you can buy in bulk. i think you have realized by now but the charger is not a whipped cream can. it is just a little bullet with the gas, hence you need special equipment to extract the gas. there is no cream in it.

I know.


Actually I will probably order from amazon as I already have stuff coming from there.


But what I'm finding odd is that the charger usually doesn't seem to be sold with the cartridges and you have to buy them seperately.


Is this typical?


I'm also still wondering about the combo with Kratom.

Yes, it's typical, because the dispenser will last for years, while you continue to buy more cartridges (which are called chargers) that get used up as you empty them.


Beware of cheap dispensers. I can't remember the brand name, but I got the cheapest one, and it failed quickly. (About every 3rd charger would fail to pierce correctly.) It's worth spending more on that component to get a good quality durable one.

Yes. I used to sit around and alternate bumps of K with balloons, and sip a margarita in addition. I haven't tried nitrous with psychedelics yet but that's next on my list.

I didn't notice very much synergy between Kratom + Nitrous. The Nitrous also seemed to numb the good body feelings from the Kratom.


Poppy Seed tea + Nitrous, however, with good dosages, I have found to be rather engaging and psychedelic. I don't know why, maybe dopamine. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Kind of lame question but what size balloons, in terms of inches, do you guys feel are best (or necessary) for nitrous crackers?


I just got a cracker today and attempted to use one for the first time in my life but the balloons I bought weren't big enough as they were only 12 inches (or at least that's how they were advertised).


They didn't seem 12 inches to me, but either way they broke when I tried to use them.


So yeah, somebody tell me what size balloons I should buy so they don't break but at the same time aren't TOO big to the point of being ridiculous.

^punch balloons. If you want to put up to 3 in there: twist the end of the balloon, put a new charger in, untwist, unload, repeat. 


Be careful with the crackers though, they aren't like dispensers. It will get really cold. If you're smart, use a sock or towel so you don't freeze your hands. Also, give it some time inbetween more than a few chargers with the cracker to warm up, and also, balloons will crack if you bend then when frozen, so be careful.

How do you make sure that the gas doesn't escape as you are putting the balloon back on the cracker?


Just by twisting/squeezing the end of the balloon really tightly?


Can you just put one charger in and do them one at a time?


I'm guessing you just mentioned 3 because it's the most you can probably fit in there at once?


I am also guessing that you will have to be really careful to squeeze the end of the balloon when taking it off the cracker before inhaling so the gas doesn't escape?

This is an image of a generic nitrous cracker. The top part, has two holes on the outside, and on the inside, has a downward facing pin or sharp piece of metal. When the threads are entirely tightened, this pin will pierce the top door on the nitrous charger; releasing the gas, which will escape through the holes of the top piece.


After you have released one charger, what I meant was; twist the end of the balloon, but, keep it still attached to the top half of the cracker. Unscrew the bottom part. Turn it upside down, let the empty charger fall out, and drop a full one inside the bottom piece.


Then, with the balloon still twisted from allowing air/gas to escape on the top part, screw the bottom half onto the top half of the cracker about 97 percent. Tighten it almost all the way, but not enough to allow the pin to pierce the nitrous charger inside. 


Then, with it mostly tightened, now allow the balloon to untwist, and you can twist the two halves of the nitrous cracker the last 3ish percent, which will pierce the charger, and release the nitrous gas into the balloon. Then you can repeat that as many times as you need.

Thanks,


Got it.


It looks just like the one I have.

I just got a nitrous cracker, some chargers and punch balloons for the first time and tried them out today.


I might not be used to using this yet, but so far I'm finding that just sucking the gas out of whip cream cans gave me a better buzz than this is and it seems to not usually be doing as much as I want.


I think maybe I'm letting some of the gas escape somehow and I'm pissed cause I already made small holes in 2 of the 4 balloons.


Do people recommend that I keep breathing into the balloon and blowing it up again as I inhale?


Thats' how I got the best buzz off of one so far...but I think that's also probably how you kill the most brain cells.


I don't know why the whip cream cannisters seem to give me a better effect...


**Does anyone know why this might be??**


I also seem to be making my lungs tired by breathing in and out so much and holding my breath and I'm wondering if I should avoid this but if I just try to take the nitrous all at once I don't seem to get much of a buzz for some weird reason.


**Is it possible for a person to strain the muscles in their lungs from breathing too deeply or holding their breath and have them take a few days to recover?**


Maybe I should have gotten a dispenser but I can't afford one now.

**Pure Nitrous Oxide vs Nitrous Oxide/Oxygen**


I wouldn't be surprised if this has been asked before, but I'm on my phone and at work right now so I can't really search through this thread or the last one right now, so I figured I'd just ask it again....


Does anyone here have experience using mixtures of nitrous oxide and oxygen, mask, balloon, or otherwise? Tanks of these mixtures exist, so I know someone out there has to be doing it. I've been using nitrous a lot lately, really just on psychedelics, and I love it, but part of me thinks that it has to be even better when mixed with oxygen. It definitely gives me some muddled cognition that reminds me of when I tried that thing where you hyperventilate and then stand up really quick to deprive yourself of oxygen that I tried a long time ago when I do a really big balloon, but I admittedly don't know if that is because of the slight oxygen deprivation that comes from taking several big pure nitrous hits in a row (even while taking breaths in between) or if it's just from the dissociation from the nitrous itself. I do know though that nootropics which increase cerebral blood and oxygen flow definitely tend to make my highs, rolls, and trips more powerful and meaningful, so it wouldn't be surprising to me if that deprivation did detract from them a bit, while I was thinking that using a nitrous/oxygen mixture could actually make the experience and the potentiation of psychedelics much cleaner.


Of course, I can't say for sure as I haven't tried it, so yeah.... Has anyone here? I would greatly appreciate some input!

@mycophile: you can get a dispenser reasonably cheap and it works so much better. It makes sucking on a whipped cream can seem a lot weaker.


I don't know how long you've been using nitrous, but I found that I like it more the more I use it, but at first it seemed like it got worse over time. Like there was a dip in the graph, if you will. I have no idea why that is, but maybe it's what you're experiencing.

I don't have a dispenser but about 2 months ago I bought a cracker and have been enjoying balloons with it ever since and yeah, it's much better than whip cream cans.


I don't know why everyone seems to prefer a dispenser to a cracker though, but at the moment I don't see the reason to spend the extra cash on one.

You don't use balloons with a dispenser?


What do you do, suck the gas right out of it?


I've heard that that can be a VERY dangerous thing to do, both cause of the gas being cold and also possibly inhaling more than your lungs can hold.

^You can simply wait for the gas to warm up, that's what my friend used to always do when we'd go through a 30 pack of chargers. I never found it to be difficult or dangerous to use, he had a high quality dispenser he somehow nabbed from a starbucks lol. You can just put one charge in at a time, and then there'd be less pressure/issues of accidentally blowing your lung up.

It's dangerous to do that with a cracker, but not a dispenser. The gas warms rapidly when it expands into the dispenser. I load two or three at a time and I don't have trouble putting too much nitrous in my lungs any more than a barista has trouble putting too much whipped cream in your frappucino. The lever regulates the rate of flow much more precisely than a balloon. You just ease back or let go if your lungs are full.

Hmm,


If it really is safe to use a dispenser then I could see how it would be preferable to a cracker.


And I guess if you started to think you were inhaling too much you could just simply pull away and exhale couldn't you?

You could, but you wouldn't have to. The gas only comes out when you press the lever and you control how fast it comes out. It's simply not an issue whatsoever .

Im finding it hard to get anything beyond an intense body high. Even after 6. Yet my friend leaves this planet on 2 and he's bigger then me. Individual sensitivity is quite big with No2. I guess nitrous is best accompanying other substances.

I agree with your last statement, you get a lot more bang for your buck if you use nitrous when you're already drunk or high. But I've gone to entirely different worlds on a few chargers and nothing else, too.

How long does a hit or whatever last on average? I have only used whipped cream cans 2x in my life. One time by itself and it seemed to be a waste of time. One time while on dxm and it dissociated me to an extreme degree. Is it best as an add on to harder substances or do people usually enjoy it for it's own merits? Seems interesting regardless.         


Edit: for some reason couldn't see the above 2 posts initially. Answers my question for the most part.

I love nitrous mixed, the main effects of mixing it with other substances (MD, 25b, alcohol) for me seems to be on duration rather than effects. However, the longer the duration the more I seem to get unusual reactions. While it's a 'soft-drug' really, I get thrown into the same loop of thought which is more internal and disturbing than I get from any other drug. While on MD in a rave I smashed the back of my head on a concrete wall and thought I was being attacked by God, on 25b I had a seriously disturbing moment and in general the longer it lasts (lasting longest on alcohol) the louder, on top of these recurring ideas and memories, some kind of manic laughing and the feeling that the world is an internal construct and some kind of higher being is mocking me. While not on the level of most Bluelighters, I've experimented with various other substances but nitrous seems to give me far more intense experiences than any other, with highly disturbing but enjoyable responses. I'm yet to try any other dissociatives but have tried several regular psychedelics, are these kind of ruminations likely to take place under the influence of, say, ketamine or MXE?

I've found that holding it in does nothing positive. Breathe it in, breathe it out. I actually get a stronger, more pleasant high and avoid unnecessarily oxygen deprivation. Several friends get the same result. Highly recommended.

How regularly can you safely use nitrous? I take 100mcg B12 daily and have done for a long time before using NO2, and during a session I will always take a few breaths of oxygen after every few breaths from the balloon at least, and go through a maximum of 24 chargers / 1 box in a session (to myself). I've been doing this around 1-3 times per week recently with friends, and although most likely I will get bored of it soon, I'm just wondering how (un)healthy this is.

Depends on a lot of factors. Hypoxia does worse damage the longer it persists. It can cause death, permanent brain damage, recoverable brain injury, or a headache. If you're using canisters, not holding your breath, breathing air between canisters, and not doing it excessively, hypoxia won't be an issue. You can't die from a dispenser. If you're breathing multiple canisters in a row with no breaths between, maybe don't do that. You're not gonna die, nor will a serious injury occur. But it's likely not good for you.


If you're using a big tank, yes you can kill yourself or damage your brain irreversibly.

But what if youre doing say 20 canisters in a row and the only break you have in between is the 2minutes it takes to inflate you and your friend's next balloon?

I would say most likely you are ok. I never seem to have breathing issues nor does anyone I have done nitrous with who is asthmatic and we typically do 100canisters or better per person

Breathe air in between, and don't hold it in. Just breathe the nitrous right back out. Everyone I know who does this gets a better high and there's way less time your brain isn't getting oxygen. 


It's not hard.

Had a freaky experience with this yesterday. Wouldn't have mentioned it but the thread is recently bumped so might as well. 


I was on an maoi and 20mg of 4-ho-mipt, plenty of smoked cannabis, and a small bump of k. Was having a great time, loaded up a charger and took the hit. I don't do nitrous often and this was my first time trying it on psychedelics. It was AWESOME. For a few seconds I nanged out, laughed my ass off, and basically just tripped out to the tune of 'it's awesome!!'. 


Pretty blown away, I waited a minute and then loaded up another. Took the hit and it was GOOD. And for a few seconds I tripped out to 'it's good!'. 


Ended up really freaking me out for a second because the first time was a blast and the second time I feel like I had broken it/myself because I didn't do it *quite* right. Like the first time I had a perfect smile/laugh at the start and it lasted through the experience, the second time it was like my face wasn't right, just not quite as happy and that was the reason the experience wasn't as good. I feel like if I had gone for a third attempt I would have smiled *too *hard and again missed the experience of the first time with some screwed-up grin. 


The second hit of nitrous made me start laughing again, but that feeling stopped me laughing cold, stopped the entire trip dead and I felt totally sober for a few moments with only slight visuals returning afterward. It left me with a very memorable lesson: Jokes are never as good as the first time you hear them. 

I realized that I wasn't really getting anything out of it because I was alone. The fact I wasn't sharing the experience with someone I loved made the entire thing pointless, like telling jokes to an empty room. It's a trivially true point I guess but the experience really made it resonate for me and made me want to get on a plane asap and move back in with my girlfriend. Overall it was a good experience because it helped me see that goal, but damn, that hit really shook me. 


Chemically speaking I think it's probably more likely the second experience being lesser was probably just tolerance, but I think that's a good enough reason for me to only do one charger per session in the future.

Okay, I keep running into this problem, and it's kinda pissing me off. Hopefully someone can help me out here.


I use just a plain old cracker and balloon, and basically every damn time without fail, I'll release somewhere between 1/4-1/2 of the canister's contents, then it's like the balloon becomes too pressurized and gas starts escaping between the neck of balloon and the cracker, sometimes even a little bit from the middle of the cracker- wasting gas and not filling the balloon. So I get NOWHERE.


I've tried a few different things, and it hasn't made a bit of difference the rate at which I expel the gas, the location of the balloon on the cracker, nothing.


What the hell am I doing wrong? Do I maybe just have a shitty cracker?


Any assistance is greatly appreciated. It's totally killing the experience.

Yeah, I was actually considering that. I know they were stocked at my shop awhile back, not sure whether they still are....

Mind enlightening me as to some benefits and drawbacks to this? Seems like a rather large investment for something that I do enjoy, but am not THAT into...


But I think I actually may have figured it out anyway. I started doing it with the cracker upside down with the balloon underneath and it has been working WAY better (though it definitely gets A LOT colder- frozen balloon and all haha).

Pretty sure I've been getting nearly all the nitrous out and into balloon with minimal leaking. I've even been able to properly get 3-4 canisters into balloon while losing nearly none of the gas- at least to my senses (sound, touch, and sight).

Maybe I'm an idiot for having done it the other way around in the first place haha.


Appreciate the assistance Xorky, much respect for your hallucinogenic expertise, have seen much of you on BL and Erowid over the years. I also quite like your mod style. Props.

I've had medical grade a ton of times but just at the dentist office (had the same dentists since I was 10 years old, so he cranks the nitrous up for me as high as I ask) and haven't really noticed a difference. Of course, I haven't been to the dentist on a candy flip, which is the only time nitrous really presents any sort of in depth experience for me (like +++++ easily). As well, the dentists I get ~45 min of a nitrous/oxygen mixture, versus just straight nitrous in one big breath.


Was it just that you maybe had a bigger balloon? Or more of it because it was from a tank I imagine?


I'm always second guessing myself on where the canisters vary in quality. But I SWEAR some taste icky. Either way, I always buy this one kind thats branded and sold by a local coffee store chain, and the nitrous tastes nice and sweet like it should.


Also, while I'm here, does anyone know how many nitrous chargers I can release into a 1 liter whipped cream dispenser? Does anyone dangerous happen if you release too many? Will it like pop or just leak out? Explosion lol? I can get 2 in there, but I'm scared to try to put 3 in there.

Some of them can fit 3, and some can't.  If it overloads, some gas will shoot back out the hole that you crack it into when you unscrew it or even as it's cracking.  Usually what I do is put 2 in there, and get the third ready, then crack the third in after I take my first big lungful.

So my buddies .5 Liter can hold 2. Not sure if that means a 1 Liter could hold 4? 


The technique you described is how I managed to do 4 in a row (with oxygen in between) on LSD+MDMA and had a more intense experience than I've had with DMT. But I was like a gunslinger with those cartridges lol, I baaaarely got that 4th one released before i blasted off. This is why I seriously envy places where tanks are a common thing.

I love nitrous but I just wish it lasted longer.


If I could have a tank that mixed with 50% oxygen like at the dentist it would be amazing.


I do find that whippits have a stronger immediate effect, so I'd probably have some whippits lined up while hooked up to the nitrous/oxygen mix, while occassionally unhooking to do some quick whip its, smoke or vape weed, while high on Kratom, Fluro-Phenibut, and perhaps also a bit drunk and we could throw some shrooms in there.


Yeah, that sounds nice lol.

I've been racking my brain as to how to do this since I had my first breakthrough with doing a "double" of nitrous on LSD+MDMA. The true nature of nitrous is brought out from getting more than one lungful of nitrous in a single experience. You could immerse yourself in the experience for minutes at a time and really explore it, I get giddy just thinking about it. Only way I could think of is having the full dental/medical set up. With that you can simply breath out of your mouth if you want pure oxygen, and nose if you want the nitrous/oxygen mix. 


With just balloons or a dispenser you can only get so far since you'll just get too far out there to load another one. Even if someone is feeding you balloons it would be difficult. So much easier to lay back with the peace of mind that you know there is enough oxygen in there medically proven to be safe to inhale continuously for at least a few minutes (hell at the dentist I'm breathing it for like 45 minutes). 


Even taking my standard 2 breaths of fresh air between lungs full of nitrous, I really wonder about how exactly the body oxygenates itself, and whether after consecutive lungfuls you'd still be depriving yourself even with oxygen in between. 


Not to mention nitrous is waaaayy more lucid and psychedelic if you are properly oxygenated. It's less about how long you hold it, but how many lungfuls you can get. I see so many people basically black out from just hyperventilating on a balloon, they're missing the point! Certainly a lot of what you exhale after you inhale nitrous is a lot of CO2, which would explain why the exhaled "nitrous" into a balloon is not as potent as the first inhalation. No point in huffing CO2 lol...

I have done nitrous in combination with various psychs and dissociatives more times than i can count and it still utterly baffles me. That blinding revelation/epiphany that is somehow paradoxically incredibly simple yet always just out of reach - on the tip of the proverbial tongue - is just so fucking wild. It really does feel like you're being given a peak behind the curtain, so to speak, at some kind of ultimate reality that operates on a far grander scale than we have the ability to comprehend. The closest I have got to explaining it is that it very broadly has something to do everything being cyclical and interconnected and being intrinsically linked to this repeating pattern that visually resembles the flower of life. This is a massive oversimplification of course, most of it is literally impossible and subsequently maddening to try and put into words.

Wow, fucking spot on man. 


I haven't done DMT in ages. And its certainly different experience, but psych+nitrous for me is on the same level in terms of sheer profoundness of an experience. It gives me this same general feeling of it makes sense for a moment, and then its gone.


The whole peak behind the curtain feeling I think has a lot to do with this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave)


It sort of teases (or completely exposes you to on more intense experiences) with the possibility that everything you've ever experienced is only a projection of your own mind.

When I do nitrous on top of psychedelics, especially LSD, it's almost always the same peak experience except I go farther than the last time.  It's of course impossible to explain, but it's this loop of realizations where the endpoint is a universe who is simply tired of existing and wishes for rest.  Like riding the line between "on" and "off".  Or something.  The sound I hear and all these other aspects are always the same, but it'll be like the music that's on, or the voices talking, or the background insects, somehow becomes this same sound.  It's quite dark and even a little grim for me but so utterly mindblowing and synchronistic that it's amazing and I love it.  I can't keep doing a whole box at once though because after a few times I'm kinda like... okay, I'm done, it got too deep there.  And I remember all these flashes but I can never retain more than a little shade of the experience.  I always come out of it staring, the coming out feels the exact same every time, just staring straight ahead with my mouth hanging open, and then I shake my head and say "pshhh... pshhh..." for a minute and then it's like "FUCKING NITROUS!!"

I DEFINITELY know what you mean about it going a bit deeper each time in a session (or overall?). Like you turn to the next page of the story that is inevitably infinite, sort of chasing your tail after a while. I remember the first could times it was like this spinning "flower of life" or whatever, that would sort of turn me to the next chapter. Each page is sort of influenced by what the last one was (cause you're thinking about it still I imagine) as well as external factors.


One time I did one, and unknowingly my friend was explaining to another person how a lot of his friends back home are recovering heroin addicts (dark topic) and totally made my trip go in the direction of seeing myself in the future, going COMPLETELY mad from being so obsessed with the nitrous profundity that my life crumbled to pieces (lost friends and family, homeless, put in a mental institute, therapists trying to find out what was wrong with me) and he was sort of narrating that. That was probably the most terrifying one I ever had, I legitimately thought I was never coming back to reality as what I had now found was the true reality (I usually feel this way from the more profound ones, albeit the reality can be just as beautiful as it was dark that time).


The "going mad" thing has always been an underlying theme/fear of my trips since I was very young; the feeling of losing control, losing the ability to discern actual reality from my own reality, especially when the experienced reality becomes more real than actual reality. I found through nitrous though, by being respectful, cautious and with good intentions, experiencing the sensation of being completely convinced of an alternate reality being the true reality can be just as profound, enlightening and beautiful as it can be utterly terrifying; you've just got to initially let go, face the experience as a visitor/guest, and immerse yourself without fighting it.

I've never been afraid of losing my sanity on psychedelics thankfully. You can't lose something you never had in the first place!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah agreed about combining it, I have never once gotten anything profound from nitrous without combining it with psychedelics.  It seems to produce the most synergy with LSD... with LSD, I get there every single time and it's as I described 2 posts back.  With tryptamines it's more lighthearted in nature, but not quite as easy to break through.  For me anyway.


I have literally never bought nitrous for myself only, I only ever do it when I'm hanging out and tripping with certain friends who are really into nitrous and tripping.  I keep it this way because I do really like it and find it compulsive.  But fortunately it's not something I seek out.

I have been meaning  to try NO2 for a long time now...


However, when I go to order it online I only see them selling whippets in bulk! I do not want to buy 50-100 at a time lol! Imagine the rattle that box would make, I should really get a PO box.

You can find it in head shops all over the place, at least in my area, in boxes of 24.  You also need to get a cracker, I'd recommend a whip cream dispenser as the metal crackers you screw and fill one balloon at a time with suck to use.

However, it seems that there are absolutely no headshops in Tennessee! When I move to CO I'm expecting to find some.

Try getting 300 of them in a box. Trust me, you'll want 50 if you try it on LSD.  I usually go through ~25 during trips. You can easily do 10-15 your first time. Pretty wild stuff. I always have some nos when tripping. It's like gravy to the experience. Plus if you're having a weird time, nos can usually knock you out of it and you forget why you were struggling.


My feeling with nos is that it simulates the feeling of dying. As you get deeper into the experience, the time dilation increases which is why when you combine it with psychedelics, it's even more profound. Psychedelics can provoke moments of eternity and moments of severe time dilation. Nitrous increases that as well as dissolving the ego (generally). This combination gets the user to the point of egoless experience. The experience of being truly in the moment. Now it's not truly there because you have these epiphanies of understanding while in this state. But the understanding is empty because it's really an understanding of dying. The epiphanies are you giving yourself a reminder that you're still alive. In fact nitrous sort of feels like asphyxiation.


Wild wild stuff. I gotta get some more for my next trip.

Yeah this is the reason I've limited my self to the 24 packs and only when I trip, I've had nights where I've gone through somewhere in the range near 75 chargers. Stuff reminds me of air duster back in my high school days when I take it sober, but on Lucy, oh man I cant get enough of the odd sensation :D[/QUOTE]

Hmm, like duster I supposed, except far more psychedelic and basically harmless if done in moderation (one of the only inhalants that doesn't cause massive cell death - it's still used in medicine after all).

Just be careful asking about crackers.  I once got thrown out of a head shop when I asked if they had any.  I was stunned.  I mean, the whippits were right there in the display case along with the glassware!  Definitely get the whipped cream dispenser.  The aluminum crackers corrode, get quite cold and you'll eventually strip the threads.  The plastic ones don't last very long.


I also once got the third degree from a cashier when buying those punch balloons.  I'm not sure what she thought I was doing with them, but she seemed really suspicious.

I was doing nitrous pretty regularly every weekend and started to have some pretty serious side effects. One lonely night, wanting to take it further, I inhaled 30-40mg of DMT then instantly proceeded to take multiple lung fulls of nitrous. What happened next pretty much ruined dmt for me ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) Immediately I was thrown into some kind of delirium accompanied by an extremely painful body load. I mean my whole body was in intense pain. To make matters even worse my tongue started to involuntarily flap around in my mouth and my vision went red. I’m not exactly sure if it was a hallucination or what, but I know the tongue thing really occurred. I thought I was experiencing serotonin syndrome or  something. Suffice to say this was not pleasant experience and I’ve been extremely apprehensive of both dmt and nitrous ever since.

That sounds absolutely scarier than hell.


I like nitrous without a hallucinogen (although, i need at least a 3 charger hit to make it anything more than just a 15 second head buzz. 3 chargers in 2 pulls. Wonderful.).


I LOVE nitrous with hallucinogens. It's magic. I've said it before, I'm a 1 hitter with LSD and a 2g to 3,5g guy on mushrooms. Never more than 15 to 20ish on RC tryptamines.  So what I love about the nitrous is it gives you the ability to take 20 second (feels like a lot longer) tours into the world of a much heavier dose. You get to experience high dose magic and then come right back down to solid dose range. Like I said, it's magical. First time I ever did it on mushrooms I shed a real tear. Immediately knew I would be chasing the dragon on that experience forever.


It's never happened to me, but i imagine on higher doses the nitrous has the ability to almost permanently take you to the next level. At least, that's my guess. Is that the case? Or is it a magically little tour no matter what the dose (of the hallucinogen, not the nitrous.)?

^ Man, shit can get real dark when you start to over do the nitrous and I’m pretty sure involuntary tongue movement is related to brain damage. I tried doing the nitrous alone a week later and Once again my tongue started to roll around. The experiences started to take on a sinister tone as well, so I’m pretty sure that it’s my body telling me to leave itself alone and properly fuck off.

I don't really do it often. I've probably never done more than maybe 30 chargers in a single day. Maybe 40. And I don't think I've ever done it on back to back days. I've only gotten nitrous 3 or 4 times. Once or twice one of my buddies had them. So in total, I've only ever done them on 5 or 6 occasions. And they kid of give me a quasi hangover (I'm a pansy. Anything that gives me any type of headache after use I consider a 'hangover". And I hate them.) So, I doubt there will ever be a time where I ever go on a binge or heavily abuse them for a time. I know that when abused regularly, the side effects can get pretty terrible. Not life threatening, but awful nonetheless.


I'm glad you're taking a break. Never a bad thing to give the brain a substance sabbath every once in a while.

I am using the cheap ICO soda bottle but the handle that dumps the gas breaks. Broke 2. You can fix it using a piece of 5/16 square stock and a grinder. Just trace the shape of the end on the bar stock with a sharpie pen and grind it down. Then drill the 1/8" hole . If you heat this thing with a propane torch you can put the bend in there and cut it off to match the original shape. That metal one will probably last forever. 

OK the trick to get the pin out. Bang it on a block of wood and let inertia be your friend. Just don't hit it so hard you break the plastic head. It takes a lot of hits but the pin will come out far enough to grab it with pliers or better, end nippers. Don't get in a hurry. Be sure you are out far enough to get on the flat part. If you grab the taper on the end you will push it back in.  


Another issue is the oil in some cartridges. Right now I am using a 0.3 micron filter but that is not a long term solution because I am going to run out of these filters and they cost a bunch of money, even if you could find them. I am thinking cut an inch off the dip tube and put a fuel filter on tube. Then fill the bottle with oil absorber (unscented kitty litter) Maybe wrap a coffee filter over some scotch bright material or something around the fuel filter to extend the life. 


As part of all of this I put a gauge on this setup between the bottle and the filter. Be aware even with the extra volume of the filter (50 cu/in or so or almost double an empty bottle) this thing is still putting over 20PSI in there with one cartridge. I certainly would not want to put 2 or 3 in there. 


Some gee whiz info. The spout of this ICO bottle is ~1/2" od so a 1/2" ID hose is a nice fit and you can put a hose clamp on it to keep it from coming off .. no balloons. Just hit the hose. That is where I have my external filter. I usually get 2 hits from a cartridge. (or one big one) If I could trick a welding store into selling me a tank again I have a nice rig with a regulator, solenoid valves and hoses. with a switch for each hose.

If you don't mind me asking, about how many chargers would you recon are in a 40 pound tank?


If you don't have an answer i understand. It's kind of a dumb question.


edit: Maybe a better way to ask would be: How many balloons does a 40 pound tank fill up? I've never done it out of a balloon, so I don't know how many chargers go into a balloon that would be sold at a festival. But I feel like that's a more reasonable way to ask the question.

20 pounds is 9.09 KG and there are 8 g in a charger so it is 1136 and a little. 


I will say you do tend to waste a lot when you just have the hose and a switch. I used to catch my wife talking and she still had her finger on the switch. This is the same woman who sits on the lanai with the slider open and the AC on because it was hot out there  ;(

This is the fix for a broken charger handle on the ICO soda siphon

You use 5/16" square stock, usually in the hardware department of lowes, Home Depot or Ace. Use a pin you can pull out easy when you are testing your fit. This is 1/8" brazing rod.

It can be a jackass case of over direction and stained upon harmless things like this.

I always pre-load with vitamin B12 as nitrous depletes that the most and this is also what loads to most of the serious health problems that nitrous can cause. I also agree with a previous poster that DMT and Nitrous are not a great mix. I have had ok experiences but overall I did not like the experience.


LSD+MDMA+Cannabis+Nitrous then a big Khole or 2 on the comedown is the best drug experience I can think of. Makes great music even more amazing! I can't wait to get off my SNRI's and trip balls!

^ Even with pre-loading b12 I was experiencing  serious side effects (lips curling, involuntary tongue movements, other nerve issues), so I think it’s more than just low b12 levels. My brain literally felt like it was shriveling up too. Haven’t done it in about 6 months, but feel like picking up a 50 pack... hmmm.

Here is one solution to the oil problem. I happened to have this filter in my garage but Amazon sells a water filter with a removable housing that would work as well ($15 for the housing and base, $6 for a carbon filter). I filled it with oil absorber. I left it a little empty so I could shake it up and get new media at the inlet. You should be able to bum a coffee cup full of this from a garage or your local gear head. The 40 pound bag is like $10. It really takes all of the strange taste away. Slip the inlet hose over your soda bottle and pull the gas from the other one. I actually ended up with a longer hose so I could sit back and chill. Of course this is just an idea . You could use PVC pipe or whatever to hold the oil absorber but you do need some kind of filter because this stuff is dusty.

Hmm little activity on the ole nitrous. Does anyone taste iron while doing whippets. Taste like my mouths bleeding. Makes me think there’s little metal shards I’m inhaling.  A comforting thought indeed.


I just noticed the post above. It probably is some sort of residue I’m tasting though It only happens when the effects are most dominant.

Finally there are smaller tanks in the local market!


A online shop who delivers nitrous has both 0.5k and 2kg mini tanks.

The price is about the same as whippets per gram of gas.

But its so much more fun when i dont need to reload.

I wonder if the research is biased by the current exuberance for alternative psychiatric treatments. Nitrous would be a very convenient treatment paradigm since it's already approved, readily available as an anaesthetic, and extremely short-acting.

It is the crap in the cart. You really need a decent filter. I am using a 0.3 micron filter in a can filled with oil absorber.

If the medical establishment wanted to embrace nitrous, psychiatrists would use it. A person will dig out old memories from their childhood and discuss them freely. They can also be very candid about what they are feeling right now. Like you say, 5 minutes later, they are back. You have to wait longer after a Covid shot.

Damn my man. That’s quite innovative. I gotta give you some props.  I think I’m going to stop using nitrous all together. I get some concerning side effects. My tongue starts twisting around on its own and my lips begin to curl up leading me to believe there’s some nervous system issues starting to form. For days my tongue feels numb.

Are you supplementing with a Vitamin B complex? I'm not totally sure what the effects of Nitrous induced Vitamin B deficiency is, but I know it depletes B very quickly.

I’m going through many dental surgeries currently on the road to get implants. I don’t think Nitrous is an anesthetic, rather it is an agent that distracts you from obsessing over the dental procedure you’re undergoing.

Yeah chronic nitrous use is probably the worst.

I only indulge in nitrous about 3-4times per year at most.

But when i do it i go for tanks of it in a few days.

Man I could go for some nitrous right now.  Too bad I don't have a box lying around.

Trying to be environmentally conscious I have a bag of about 200 of those little whip it cannasters, the small ones.  I have had it in a closet for a long tme not knowing if they go in the garbage or recycle.  What do you all do with the empties?

I toss them in the recycle. They pull out the steel magnetically and they are "Light Iron" that goes for 8 cents a pound. An empty weighs about 20 grams on my triple beam. A fifty box of empties is a kilo. (17-18 cents). I go through 4 or 5 of those a week so I am giving them the best part of a buck and they don't have to pay a tipping fee to land fill it. Win for everyone. You can call and ask but I bet they say anything steel.

Nah... it just brought old times back to my mind. I love nos. Not nos alone, but combined with cannabis. And The Prodigy music.


It used to be expensive. So i did some research online if it is still expensive. Yes, it truly is...

Hey guys, just a reminder that we can't talk about where or how to get nitrous or specific pricing.  I realize it's legal but even so.  The only stuff we can talk about sourcing for is HR related materials such as testing reagents, scales, wheel filters, and stuff like that.

You gotta shout pachinko when dumping a few hundred empties in the recycling, so the neighbors don't catch on. At least, that's what I do.

A dozen empty PBR bottles make it one big cacophony of sound. Dump it in the barrel fast. 

I could put them in the trash. 

The steel slag will still come out of the incinerator. It's not worth as much to them and they have to pay to tip it and extract it. 

Maybe good deeds do go unpunished.

If I was worried they would go out in bags of garbage and dog poop.

Well I picked a box up at today after a long break and I still get some disconcerting side effects. As the effects begin to set in after a few canisters my tongue begins to curl upwards on its own And becomes slightly numb. Not entirely sure what that implies, but feels neurologically  pernicious.

Nitrous has become one of my fav psychedelics. I get telepathic messages from entities every time I do it. I will put on some type of media like live-streaming random people or music, and somehow nitrous allows reality to be modified to where the people (that I don’t even know) are speaking about me specifically (in their voice etc) and it’s something related to my life.


What’s weird is sometimes the effect is still going after it wears off. 


Sometimes strange thing will happen in sync with me in the environment, like cars honking 3 times then the live streamer bangs their hand on a desk 3 times. Like it’s happening on purpose to prove to me that it’s really happening the way I see it. 


I have 50 pages of weird stuff I wrote on whippits, how reality works, I’d do a whippit and get an instant download. It’s weird, it’s like entities will just put thoughts in my mind or they’ll modify my vision and audio to trigger my own thoughts to think of something specific they’re trying yo tell me. 


I’m obsessed with the experience and it’s addictive. Spent a lot of money.

It's been at least 3-4 years since I did nitrous but before then I was pretty obsessed with it as well. Initially for the partying but then for the mind bending psychedelic aspects. As long as you don't believe it then it's fine just see it as another trip. But yeah... a lot of money, once you start them you don't want to stop.


I can't even remember the most fucked up experiences as you tend to forget them but I wish I wrote them down, you definitely come to from a balloon and feel like you've learned something important but forget it straight away. I can vaguely remember:


1. Hallucinating a ghost/entity walking over my bed as I lied there and I saw/felt the footsteps in the duvet fabric
2. My vision splitting in two and turning upside down
3. Having an imaginary conversation with my friend only 2 minutes later to be told I was just babbling to him meaningless sentences
4. Inanimate objects appearing 'alive' for a couple of minutes and turning towards me from the corner of my vision (like a desk lamp)
5. Weird images overlaying on my vision, one was Homer Simpson I think?
6. Strange time hallucinations where it feels like I go back in time to a previous nitrous trip months ago... like nested trips
I get a similar kind of thing with relating live streamers etc. to my life on shit laods of ket. I feel like the streamer is speaking to me and I'm being watched through my laptop screen 


Anyway I stopped because I developed some kind of tolerance to them which seemed permanent even with months of breaks. I wonder if I do them again whether I'll get an effect seeing as it has been so long

Did nos on lsd for the first time recently. 100% what a buzz. 


One thing I found odd was I didn't really notice it whole tripping but when I did the remaining ones I had left the next day I noticed the gas seems to have a very distinct 'mechanical' taste and odd texture. 


The balloons were just normal ones and when I blew one up with my own breath to see if the taste was from the balloon it wasn't any different from any other balloon I've ever tasted. 


So it seems the gas itself is quite tainted. I noticed that the brand I bought is about 10-20% cheaper than other ones when browsing online stores in my country. I bought them at a head shop and it was the only brand they stocked. 


Wondering what people's experiences are with this? Back in the day it was always this brand.. Can't remember but it was mostly red box and italic/soft shaped letters for the brand. These ones that taste funny are blue and white box and they seem to be the main ones that show up on aliexpress lol. 


Also interestingly I didn't find they were blowing up the balloon as much as I remember. Maybe 75%%? I don't know if that part I'm imagining but I swear they seem a lot smaller. They also don't fuck me up as much, like I had to really be super efficient and it seemed like it took longer to hit and didn't hit as hard or as long? Just seems like less nos and what nos is in there is not even close to pure, maybe like 50% or some shit. 


I dunno. Feels like kids nos or some shit. Something youd get in a happy meal. Not the real deal. What do people think?

Probably the disgusting balloon rubber mixed salvia that pools inside your balloon and you inhale into your mouth


After your next nitrous session dangle the balloon and see how much shit pours out

I only care for nitrous if I'm on a psychedelic already, if not, all I get is a strong buzz that feels good but wears off in 60 seconds and isn't anything special. But if I'm on a psychedelic, or an empathogen, it's outrageously fun and seems extremely profound in the moment, though I can never remember it.  After many years, the best I can describe it is that I feel like I am reasoning out something on the cusp of being and nonbeing... I feel a vast cosmic irony (joke is not the right word), it feels like I am the universe about to reach the decision to just stop with all this ("this" being existence, the thing we're all experiencing).   It can get quit dark, but it's extremely mind blowing and not at all scary.  Then on the way out of it, I experience a bunch of synchronicities with extreme audio distortions.  I am always sure I will be able to remember it, but never can.  It feels like it picks back up where it left off every time, and also like the nitrous moments are part of a continuous experience had by many individuals across time.  That's not exactly it but it's the best words I can come up with.


I bought 2 boxes of 50 today... I'm heading to a Burn tomorrow morning and I'm gonna trip a lot, and share the nitrous around.  I'm sure I won't be the only one bringing some.

Huh, that's what I experienced on MXE once while sitting in a room messing around with my breath. I was so high I felt I had complete control over it, and in a sudden flash indeed had the decision to just stop everything.. not even just the experience of this life, but also every experience that could follow. Quite terrified I decided to return, which felt like a failure, but also rather life-affirming.


I don't think I ever reported on it before, because it's a pretty bonkers thing to happen. Then again, it's probably where the Hindus get their idea of stepping outside of samsara from. Maybe with enough wet afternoons with nothing better to do they kept getting at it ending up desensitized to the shock and awe of that decisive moment. And still they chose to return, not out of fear but rather out of compassion for other beings whose suffering they're resolved to end. Or at least so the legend goes.


Anyway, nitrous has oxygen deprivation built into its rocket-speed dissociation, so it shouldn't be surprising our logs overlap here.

What kind of messages are these? Would you care to share some examples? Maybe you'd like some external feedback.


I don't want to be rude, but what you're describing has some similarities with certain kinds of insanity.


I agree that nitrous gives amazing feelings, but to me they are just feelings and i would worry if they started taking on the character of delusional perceptions.


Do you know the risk of B12 depletion? Have you considered alternatives?

They keep telling me life is something like a game simulation. Also that I’ve gone through many previous lives, possibly infinite. They will do things in a humorous way to try to get me to lighten up about how hard life is. They will send me telepathic ideas about some things to try next.


Also for a while I was doing whippits to try to figure out what consciousness is and “they” would show me a different part of it each time. After a while though they start getting mad and weird shit will start to happen…


Like, they will break my dispenser, or make it get super cold way too fast. Other times it won’t get very cold at all. All sorts of impossible stuff happens like one time my hand was bloody after a whippit and I couldn’t see how it could have happened. 


A few times they cranked my TV volume up to 99 (normally it’s at like 7 max). I really do think it’s actual entities but technically it could be my body doing it when I’m inside nitrous land.


Some of the things seem impossible though, just recently I only did like 20 whippits out of 50 and the entire dispenser was sooo cold it wouldn’t work (it’s one of those huge ones). Then a couple days later I was able to do 150 straight without it ever getting that cold. It’s like weird stuff happens to where I think about how it’s possible later and it makes me laugh because it seems impossible.


There were times I found whippits hidden in strange places, unused. Places too far away from where I was, there’s no way I could have ran over there while high to hide them. 


All of the “impossible” stuff is stuff that is impossible to prove, like it’s designed that way to where you just sound crazy if you tried to explain lolz. 


Oh also they told me that this simulation or life has many types of magical possibilities but they said “scientific method only please” because the normal logical reality is the best one. If lifeforms with consciousness could cheat or bypass the rules regularly it would be too much chaos. 


They seem to want to show me various forms of proof that synchronicity does exist and “they” can move reality around. I kept seeing how all of our brains are sort of hooked up to this hidden network of communication, which acts to unconsciously direct our actions. So if you play the game right you can get more lucky. 


They also told me that drugs and even psychedelics in general are a failed experiment for the most part.

Yeah, that pretty much nails it. Seems like our bodies react to nitrous the same way.

I reconize this type of experience with nitrous. The difference is the interpretation.


I'm not saying you are delusional, but what you describe seems like a warning sign to me. You are skeptical, but also not far from actually believing these things which are so easily explained as drug induced confusion and which never appear in any other context than these short drug trips.


I do think dissociatives have real benefits in terms of refreshing our thoughts and feelings, but simply believing anything that could seem to appear is naive. Rather, the beneficial effect is a result of the intense run of confusing unusual experimental thoughts and feelings you just had, and it's totally okay that almost every single one of those thoughts and feelings was complete gibberish. It was your brain playing, having fun. Fun and play is all good, but there is an important distiction between that and... other stuff. Call it reality, chores, being a grownup...


I think i understand where you're coming from with this. I think you have at some point and in some way been denied the right to play. You have learned that play is bad. So your psyche tries to convince itself that your fun (nitrous in this case) is actually something way more important and serious than simple, stupid, childish and unproductive fun. Sorry if i'm wrong, just guessing. Anyway i think you are allowed to play and drugs are awesome regardless of whether you learn some important shit to show for it.

Why not relate the balloon sucking to breastfeeding while you're at it! ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)


Your critique applies to all of us to a degree, [@Mjäll](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/110065/). But it's more conducive for an open, sharing environment if we try to keep paternalism and psychoanalytical reduction at a minimum. Dissociatives do wacky stuff, stuff that civilization might not last long enough for to fully understand, it's downright sci-fi. Nobody wants to feel like a dumb little child for honestly reporting on it.

Maybe you are right. I still feel that was worth saying. I hope the person addressed doesn't feel humiliated. My interpretation was he/she was asking for an external perspective and advice.


My reason for not relating the inhalation to breastfeeding is i don't believe in that. However, i believe that feelings such as those i described are common in drug abuse and psychosis. The perceived need for rationalization becomes overbearing. Doing drugs simply for fun and enjoyment requires a self-love that everyone (at face value) deserves. I tried to show understanding and if i am wrong i want my advice to be duly ignored.

Btw nitrous is a big controversy here in Sweden now. Stupid people (kids and adults) are using it often without even googling the risks, and then claim no-one should even try it and it should be restricted. A 30 year old man had used nitrous bi-weekly to the point of temporarily losing his walking ability from B12 depletion mediated nerve damage - and blames the fucking drug. Can i walk off a cliff and blame the cliff? Does anyone want to prohibit alpine skiing? What a total idiot!

I don’t necessarily think the experiences are real, but they are super interesting. It’s like my mind has a simulation or model of the universe and nitrous makes it do crazy interesting stuff. I don’t really know but it’s super fascinating.

In the tinnitus thread [@Mjäll](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/110065/) gave some second-hand reports of tinnitus on nitrous. I gave a quick rant about it, but now I've looked a bit closer at its mechanisms it turns out that it does activate the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR), which is a red flag for tinnitus as I've regretfully personally experienced on 3-HO-PCP, the pharmacodynamics of which now turn out to have a significant overlap with those of nitrous oxide. In addition the gas does all sort of things with the ion channels, of which many types are present in the inner ear and which you generally want to avoid with tinnitus.


So nitrous oxide reads like a serious tinnitus risk on paper. Preloading with high-quality magnesium (generally associated with tinnitus prevention) and ginkgo biloba (KOR antagonism) seems appropriate harm reduction for anyone going on a nitrous binge.

If they are doing a nitrous study maybe they should contact me. I just added up my orders and in the last 4 years I have done almost 30,000 carts. I do get my blood checked fairly regularly and my B-12 is in the normal range but I take a supplement. 

I have never screwed with balloons. I use a soda siphon with a toggle loader. You do need a real filter. I have a 2 stage filter. It goes through a bed of oil absorber then a 0.3 micron filter. The gas that comes out is pretty clean  The soda bottle does collect a whole lot of oil. I wouldn't even consider using these carts without a filter.

I need to get some things straight. I introduced my stoner friend to nitrous and he thinks it is the best thing on the planet. Which it kinda it is.


However, sometimes he will say that he had a bad trip????


I have never ever ever experienced a bad trip on nitrous (I’ve done so much nitrous), neither have any of my friends, or anybody that I have spoken to who has done nitrous.


Is this cap?


I do believe that he smokes while he does nitrous so can the weed combination make him have a bad trip? He does not have bad trips on weed alone so I would not think so.


I think it may be a placebo affect(?) because he described nitrous as mushrooms to one of his friends and he has never done shrooms.

He definitely smokes too much pot. I’ve tried to help him understand he’s addicted, but to no avail.


Also, is it such a thing to NOT like nitrous oxide?????


Actually, never mind, he didn’t like molly so it’s quite possible.

I suppose you bring your trip with you. If you start out in a bad mood, I doubt much will make it better until you deal with why you are unhappy. Doing drugs alone only makes that worse.

The fiendish euphoria and shame attached to it can cause some anxiety ime. Often brings a twisted mood to the experience. The noisy metal bulk and weird process only serves to increase this unpleasant edginess, especially when new to nitrous.


Ideally you want to be using the high to deal with stuff deeper inside you rather than momentary feelings arising from the consumption of the drug itself. It takes a bit of practice.

KOR activation is linked to dysphoria. Nitrous does much more than that, but it's in the list. 


It's also part of that "petite mort" feeling after orgasm. Usually insignificant, but potentially rather depressing.

Have completely fallen in love with Nitrous Oxcide and I'm truly started to understand the true nature of the substance. I've gained the ability to utilize the substance in a positive manner to enrich my life and treat my bi polar disorder, it's like an immediate reset much similar to what Psychedelics and other Dissociatives do for me. One of the unique benefits of it tho is it's incredibly short duration and it's ability to just put you on the right track and you can move along business as usual.


I've found the anti-depressant ability to last longer than the drug is in your system as well. I could be going through a great deal of stress and the hit some balloons and it all just fades away, and with my newfound perspective I continue to feel better. But also it's just fun as hell recreationally for me and I really enjoy the drug quite a bit. I've been using it once a week in pretty substantial doses but planning on switching that to day of indulgence every 14-21 days to allow my absorption of b-12 to normalize in my body.


If anyone else has noticed positive benefits from using this compound I'd love to hear about it ![🙂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It is certainly a way to get everything off your chest. If you and your partner do an evening of gas, most of your unresolved issues come up. You just have to deal with them but you should have anyway. I have also found adding oxygen is better than just using the nitrous. I drilled and tapped a 1/8" NPT thread in the thick part of this soda bottle, added a hose barb and I put about 10psi of O2 in there. A cart takes that pressure up to 65-70 but the vessel is rated for much more than that. A pure O2 hit is almost as good as a nitrous hit once you get it in your system. It also eliminates the hypoxia problem. A small M-6 medical bottle lasts through about 60-70 carts.

Let me ask you this. I was once a heavy nitrous oxide user. Do you find that you store things within the nitrous oxide experience that can only be accessed during subsequent nitrous oxide experiences.


I have gone very deep within the nitrous oxide experience. There are levels to the nitrous oxide experience, it goes deeper and deeper as blood concentration rise.

I could be going through a great deal of stress and the hit some balloons and it all just fades away, and with my newfound perspective I continue to feel better. But also it's just fun as hell recreationally for me and I really enjoy the drug quite a bit. I've been using it once a week in pretty substantial doses but planning on switching that to day of indulgence every 14-21 days to allow my absorption of b-12 to normalize in my body.

Supposedly it can have long lasting antidepressant effects similar to ketamine.


I don't really like dissociatives much but I also fell in love with nitrous due to how comfortable and euphoric it is. Averaged 50 cartridges a day for over a year. These days i find it irritates my lungs.

Well I went through 300 cartridges yesterday which is the most I ever did before. Was literally blowing balloons for 4-5 hrs and my girlfriend got irritated cuz she was pretty bored during the period and took a nap, she was also high off her rocker from a powerful Kratom Extract I'd given her. That MIT-45 had her cooking and since she had zero opioid tolerance it had her nodding and everything. So she wasn't super mad I was doing so much Nitrous.


But next time I think I'm just gonna bring 150 cartridges to the hotel cuz after I crossed a certain point I was kinda just chasing it. I'll tell you what tho when I had two balloons with 5 carts, having her hold one while I filled the other, inhaling them back to back I would fall into this state of euphoria that was just pure bliss. I'm gonna take a break for another 2-4 weeks tho and let my body start getting it's b12 reserves get built up, I use that Methylcobalamin everyday to stay as healthy as possible.
