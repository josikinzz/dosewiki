> The NBOMe series is known to be more dangerous than other psychedelic drug families. High doses can easily result in severe reactions such as seizures and HPPD. It is possible to get away with high doses because the mental component of the trip is mild so it may not feel as intense as other psychedelics even though there are powerful visuals. In order to try and overcome this some users take several doses to get a more intense/spiritual experience. While this does work for some, for others this is where the serious side-effects emerge.

Come to think of it I think it's been over a year since I had any real psychedelics (apart from say 6-apb which I take in fairly low dose and although it does give me some mild visual effects sometimes, I wouldn't class it as a true psychedelic it's more of an empathogen/entactogen with some mildly trippy effects.

> Here is the technical guide I found most useful for making a betacyclodextrin complex. [http://online1.ispcorp.com/Brochures/Pharma/CavamaxBulltn.pdf](http://online1.ispcorp.com/Brochures/Pharma/CavamaxBulltn.pdf) Look on page 7 for the different methods of preparing a complex. For the small scale lab without specialised equipment it recommends the -Paste Complexation or Kneeding- method. Now you'll need to check what the mole ratio is for making a complex I think from memory it maybe 1mole of active to 1 or 2 moles of betacyclodextrin. I've been told that if you have an excess of betacyclodextrin in this mole ratio it just makes things safer for a good mix. So I'd recommend always working it out with an excess of betacyclodextrin by mole mass ratio (not milligram to milligram ratio). I found a mini mortar and pestle worked a treat for so you can salvage as much of the dryed paste/powder from it fairly easily. These are those $5 ones you can buy from ebay in china. I added small amounts of distilled water to make a paste or almost a thick solution or suspension. As I worked the mortar and pestle over the hour it gradually dried up and I needed to add a few more drops of distilled water. In the end I scraped it up with a razor hobby knife and after letting it dry thoroughly I crushed the powder and mixed it very thoroughly. Now the final step I choose to do may not be necessary. I heard a rumour somewhere that there can be electrostatic charges in a standard plastic baggie that can unmix certain mixed powders or at least cause then to cling to the sides in an uneven fashion. Who knows maybe this is hogwash but what I do is once I've thoroughly mixed my dried complex powder I make a mini envelope from gloss magazine paper (they are called a flap in North America and various powders sold on the street come in them). I keep the envelope then inside a baggie.

> 
> Here is something important to consider if you are unfamiliar with minimum weighable mass... Basically the minimum amount of active (NBOMe family in this case) you can weigh accuratly for making into a complex.
> 
> According to proper lab weighing procedure the minimum weighable mass of a milligram scale (a scale that weighs down to 0.001g and has a standard fluctuation in either displaying +/-1mg) is 20mg. So 20mg weighed on those scales is called the minimum weighable mass because it's to be within 95% accuracy (ie. it could be between 21mg to 19mg). If you are weighing 10mg on those scales then the accuracy becomes 90%. Now if you are weighing on cheap milligram scales that displays a fluctuation of +/-2mg then your minimum weighable mass becomes 40mg to get the 95% accuracy. If you weighed 20mg on those scales with +/-2mg you'd be getting 90% accuracy. Continue this simple mathematics if your scale displays a fluctuation of +/-3mg to work out your minimum weighable mass and accuracy of the total. Also highly recommended I find using calibration weights. The set I got was 20bucks or less inc shipping from ebay. Get a set that has tiny milligram weights of 10mg or 20mg (I've noticed 50mg or 100mg calibration weights can be off by a couple of milligrams). This way you get an idea how accurate your scales are.

> 
> Many people like to use hydroxypropylbetacyclodextrin (HPBCD) as it's properties are better than betacyclodextrin (I can't remember exactly but I think its more soluble or it has a higher bonding ratio). Anyway from my looking into it HPBCD is more expensive and standard betacylodetrin is good enough for my purposes. Basically I found HPBCD and betacyclodextrin both a bit tricky to find for sale without a permit/account at a pharmaceutical/chem supplier (which for your purposes would be extremely dodgy trying to explain). Anyway after much searching I found a RC vendor I'm familiar with sold betacyclodextrin all along!

> I ended up making my complex with 26mg of 25I so the accuracy percent should be pretty good. Now the end product I just weight up and snort 20mg of substance for 2mg of active 25I. The betacylodextrin goes well up the nose too.

> If you are unsure about what you are doing don't attempt to make a complex! Even worse and much more risky is a simply mixing of NBOMe family active with an excipient (filler) which I've been told can mix unevenly and leave hotspots besides. If you do make a complex please double check your stoichiometry and maths with someone else who is knowledgeable. Once you've made your complex start low!! We already know from one Erowid user mistake that 30mg (and eaily less) is enough to cause siezures followed by cardiac arrest and then death, unless resuscitated which thankfully this person was and lived to tell the tale.

> On another topic would anyone experienced in the NBOMe family and the 2C-x family be willing to submit their ideas as to how they rate them in terms of the depth of psychedelic nature of the trip? I just don't know if 25C or 25I really has much depth to it like a good solid trip on 2C-E or even possibly 2C-I (which is even less deep than 2C-E). Although I've not yet tried 2C-P I would guess based on SAR and anecdotal reports it's probably even more potent and deeply psychedelic/therapeutic than 2C-E (which has been my favourite for phenethylamine deep enchanting trips).

I've only done one trip on 25I and thankfully the dose was right that I got the full experience of lots of visuals and feeling immersed in a trip. From my brief encounters with these 2 of the NBOMe family I can only say that think my mind was fairly empty and the trip seemed fairly direction-less. I think 2C-E and 2C-I took me more for a journey and I suspect these substances are more suited to deep psychedelic, analytical, psycho-spiritual exploration. Has anyone tried the main range of potent NBOMe's (25B, 25D, 25C, 25I) a number of times and can they compare if they were anywhere as deep/psychedelic as a good dose of 2C-E?

The day I got the 25i I dosed ~500ug and had a pretty held back trip, then the day after that I redosed with the same amount and had a trip infinitely more intense. Each and every time after that the effects have been consistent with the dose (which is somewhere in the middle between those 2 times) There's something really off about this behavior, so if I were you I'd be a bit more cautious about dose-range and redosing. You never know what might happen with this and there is always a next time!

I've checked with a few official pharmaceutical guides to different methods of creating a complex with betacylodetrin for this very reason that I didn't want to use one of the cheaper more accessible options of an excipient like lactose and then have the possibility of hot spots (uneven distribution). I followed an official pharmaceutical guide for making a complex with betacylodextrin. The best small scale way was to make a paste gradually and work it thoroughly in a mortar and pestle for an 1hr. I worked out the molar masses before hand and made sure the beta cylodextrin was in excess. I double checked the calculations with those in the advanced drug discussion. I did this as well as checking with my pharmacist friend along the way. The complex is stored flat in a paper flap, just incase any unmixing max happen in just a plastic baggie. So far each of the 10mg (1mg active 25I) snorted dosages has had the same effect. I think it's safe to assume the complex is evenly distributed.

Each subsequent dose was also 1mg except for one dose which was in the middle which was a tiny speck of the pure 25I that where miniscule scrapings from up from the weighing paper from before I made the complex with betacyclodextrin. Judging by effects of the other 1mg doseges the pure 25I scrapings were minuscule (although I admit my approach with that was a little foul hearty). so in total over roughly 3hrs over 3mg was snorted.

> The thing is that I've redosed with the NBOMe family before. With 25C I took 600µg nasally it wasn't too intense but was a little visual so I waited a few hours till the visuals started to die off then snorted another 600µg and WOW ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) that's when when walls where breathing and really got to the full on visuals. As Bender would say to Elzar "kick it up a notch!" and that's exactly what re-dosing on 25C did. It made it much more intense than the initial 600µg dose. 25I however seems much more fickle to me and I'm scared as to what initial dose I should take next time??? I too believe others out there with the phenethylamine psychedelics that one initial dose is best.

After the nonsense of going though liquid measurements and dehydrations every time to snort a dose of with 25C, this time I decided to go the whole hog and made a betacylodextrin complex for easy weighing up snortable dosages (ie weigh 10mg of substance and have 1mg of active). 
>

> 
> So anyway I finally tried 25I tonight and it really surprised me the large dose I needed. I was really surprised that for me I needed to keep re-dosing and re-dosing to hit the point that it really became visual and a fully fledged psychedelic. It took 4 repeated dosages over around 3hrs totalling over 3mg!! I'm really surprised as I found 25C dosage was bordering on visual at 600µg and by 1mg it was well and truly very visual and psychedelic.

(Most of us know there have been seizures and deaths from high dosages of this substance) If anyone can please give any feedback it would be much appreciated as I'm really astounded as such a large dose needed! I don't have the most accurate scales but I did use minimum weighable mass for my betacylodextrin complex and I am fairly confident the dosages should be fairly accurate. Do my doseages of 3+mg look right to the rest of you?!? ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

> With 25i you should have your full dose at the start and not redose, after an hour redosing becomes worthless (IMO with buccal). I also advise you to take a more reasonable dose after your tolerance subsides (2+ weeks), possibly 250ug larger than your previous initial dose.

Thank you very much Ekstasis, very helpful post ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


For your question, they're pretty shallow (notably 25c), but sometimes it *can* get very deep. Once had what I now believe to be a ++++ on 25i, I mentally connected to entities and attained all the knowledge of the universe for a short while, 10 minutes maybe? Don't know, time-dilation that trip was the most intense I've ever had it, what seemed to be 2 hours was 1 minute. Trip almost took a turn for the worst because of that, but luckily I was smart enough to watch a movie. My views of reality really changed that trip, and I found a new life. That's a +4 right?


It was that redose-trip I mentioned earlier, never been able to reproduce that though

that trip?


that is really strange that 500ug even worked two days in a row


sounds like a blast though


was your mindset different?  more time spent meditating or something?

Yeah that trip it was primarily the mindset, and it was nothing like any other (NBOMe) trip since. As for what I was doing, nothing much apart from laying in my brand-new bed (which is a really good bed, I guess that was the trigger or something) and listening to music, though I kept forgetting to put on new tunes so not much of that either. Hardly had any visuals, though some auditory stuff now and then.


Not even LSD or 4-Aco-DMT has touched that within the doses I tried them so far. Both superior and much deeper compounds in my book, but that one experience really sticks out. Guess I just got really lucky though


I'm still in the earlier stages of being a psychonaut (spelling correction wants to correct this to psychopath, coincidence? I think not) btw, only had 15 trips at the most and that was my third trip ever. Might change the rating to a heavy +++ later on

Finally got around to trying this compound 5 days ago and I must say I am very impressed. I applied a 600 µg of 25I-NBOMe HCl perforated blotter paper to my gums around 8 pm with my roommates after returning from a nice mother's day dinner with the family. My roommates are all very keen to embark on new psychedelic journeys and have only experienced psilocybin mushrooms a handful of times. I am slightly apprehensive about dosing as this would be my first experience with the compound and my companions have very little experience with psychedelics.


I did not keep much track of time, however within an hour my state of consciousness was noticeably altered. After a slightly uncomfortable come up playing Super Smash Bros and watching Netflix, we decided to go for a walk through a nearby park and forest. 


Motor functions were not inhibited and I was rather coordinated while doing some tricks on my skateboard along the way. Euphoria and visuals were presenting themselves; the sky grew brilliant and vibrant with a spectrum of colour emanating from the setting sun and the breeze on my skin felt wonderful.


We make it to the forest finally and continue down the only path through the forest which bridges over a small creek. As soon as we entered the forest some teenagers began following behind us, and our moods instantly went from joyous and cheerful to silent and analytical. As we finish crossing the bridge we all notice silently that there is a rather large group of people at the top of the stairs in front of us, and immediately realize the people behind us are connected to that group. The realization of being outnumbered sets in and I clench my board in my hand in case things go sour. As we are climbing the stairs nothing but strange vibes are emitted from our new unwanted companions, and my visuals contort the face of one of the individuals into that of an old man leading to the thought that these kids just got busted. With that thought I laugh to myself and continue to walk by as they stare hard at us. When we finally near the end of the path and reenter a place where others have the possibility of seeing us get our asses kicked I hear one of them call out "Hey, wanna buy some weed?" which made me chuckle again.


Walking around for the next hour or so we discuss the strange things that have happened, appreciate the beauty of our surroundings, and observe more strange events in our contorted consciousnesses. 


On our way back to our house we stop for a little bit at the park and take a moment to enjoy the swing sets. Swinging became too euphoric to maintain as every time I would descend forward from my peak height it felt as though I were dropping on a roller coaster which felt so good I believed my hands may be unable to hold their grip on the chains. 


After the park, we ventured over to the tennis courts which were illuminating the night with what was then bright enough to be considered daylight. We were still of very positive mindsets; cracking jokes, exploding with laughter, enjoying ourselves overall.


Upon returning to the house, we all sit back to relax, watch some episodes of Adventure Time, Blue Mountain State, and finally Trainspotting. During this period time dilation had reached a maximum and was perpetuated by my one friend repeatedly stating the time roughly every 10-20 minutes yet it felt as though hours had passed since he last said the time.


Around 5 am I retired to bed with some difficulty sleeping. I roll around still euphoric and with mild closed eye visuals for about a half hour until I drift peacefully to sleep. I awoke the next morning feeling unquestionably refreshed and impressed with this compound that I had put off for so long.


Overall I felt it shared much similarity to some of the 2C-x compounds with the most notable differences being a milder body load, and longer duration experienced with 25I-NBOMe. Visuals were also superior to those experienced with 2C-I but milder than those of 2C-B, 2C-E and 2C-T-7. I am excited to embark on another such adventure in the near future.


I will hopefully clean this post up and add more details later.

Thank you for posting your experience. Is it true you are saying that you found 2C-B to be more visual than 2C-I? Personally I found 2C-B to be very weak visually, 2C-I and was very visual and then 2C-E even arguable stronger still visually. Personally I found at when I tried half a dozen trips of 2C-B at doses of 20-30mg of 2C-B there was little more than visual movement and distortion whereas (at least without tolerance) 20mg of 2C-I often created geometric visuals that covered my whole field of vision. If I had tolerance and have used 2C-I within a few weeks 20mg would still make some pulsing and patterns just not as intense nor covering my whole field of vision. 2C-E always seemed always very visual to me even if I'd had tolerance and taken it a week ago. I have to say arguably that 2C-E is for me even more visual and potent than 2C-I since I've not yet even had the guts to go as high as 20mg. 18mg of 2C-E has been the most highest I've done and the visuals have always been very alive.

I have only done 2C-B on a few occassions, each time being 25 mg and found the visuals and body load to be quite heavy. I have done 2C-I at 15 and 20 mg doses, each time producing light to mild visuals and body load, but a strong psychedelic mind state. I found my comfort zone with 2C-E at 12 mg and never surpassed that; always experienced mild to strong visuals and a strong psychedelic mind state. 2C-T-7 was only experienced once at 10 mg insufflated (split in two and spaced over a few hours) and produced intense visuals, little body load and intense psychedelic mindstate.

25C-NBOMe was experienced once at 375 µg sublingual and produced mild visuals and psychedelic headspace, little bodyload, but rather defined euphoria.

Sorry for being so vague, typing with a tablet.

Is 25I-NBOMe orally bio-available at all? Don't worry, guys... I'm not into the NBOMe's and have no intention of ingesting this, particularly via this ROA. I just need to know.

Has anybody here had trouble with 25I being overly shallow? I have taken it twice, at 800 and 1200 micrograms, and 25C twice as well, and I find both chemicals to be somewhat uninspiring. There are some plain visuals, and a little bit of trippy thinking, but they both lack that wonderful something that some people describe as the psychedelic mindfuck. I didn't feel that there was much energy, or much to be found. I do notice some have been found to have abnormally weak or strong experiences due to natural variations in sensitivity, perhaps I simply need to take more? Or are they intrinsically shallow mentally?

Yeah I agree with that description. I felt like sound was more amplified and colors looked more interesting but nothing that would make me stare at a piece of trash longer than to make sure I didnt step in it. It feels like you are just stuck waiting for an ecstasy roll to kick in at like the 58 minutes after ingestion period. I feel bad for people who are expecting to take LSD and really take 25I because if you werent aware of the differences you would probably just assume you had a bad acid trip

They are shallow mentally, but try a higher dose for some very unique strong (strongest Ive had) visuals and an extremely happy mood.  This was with 25C for me.  Do it 3 weeks since your last dose at the least.

The nBOME gets cleaved off in first pass metabolism so you only have 2C-I in you at that point. 1 mg or less in barely perceivable but I guess you could swallow 15 tabs of nBOME to have a poor man's 2C-x experience. Note, don't actually try this because it is dangerous.

Thank you, Doomsdayguy. Like I said, I have no desire to ingest 25I-NBOMe, regardless of ROA. Besides, I possess 750mg of ultra-pure 2C-I... Anyhow, can someone else please confirm the first-pass cleaving mechanism regarding 25I-NBOMe? Does it really simply turn to 2C-I? Would 20mg orally kill a rooster?

Shallow, is an interesting word. It seems inherently negative, but let me elaborate on a positive.  I mean to some I suppose it is a negative, as they expect something like LSD or Mushrooms.  You should not expect that kind of headspace.  It is all eye candy, and body euphoria.  If anything it is closer to a candly flip IMO.  It has all the stability of good pure MDMA  and all the visuals of LSD.  Now don't get me wrong there is some headspace but it is not deep.  


For those looking for some powerful spiritual journey  don't look here.  For a person like me who no longer has a need to peel back the envelope of my brain and soul, it is perfection.  


 It's kinda like taking a classic disney movie like Fantasia (LSD)  and remaking it in CGI (25I).  It will look pretty to some, but it will lack a sole.  It is strange the 3 times I have played with this and gotten visuals, HD  vision is a perfect description of the crispness and clarity to the visuals.  But they are simply there...  one has no real 'control over them'  they move as they please, where as on LSD I distinctly remember controlling the visuals at certain points.


Simple rules to follow have been laid out numerous times, but tread very carefully,  and take  into consideration all tools neccessary if working with Powders.  Proper scales, proper ability to accurately solve the powder out of it's container, evap the solvent then weigh the powder.  These are the keys, some vendors accidently drop in an extra 20 mg here or there,  that can be a big deal for a person ordering 50 mgs.  


eyeball nothing, and half or quater blotters depending on there supposed ug value.

It varies from person to person but all I can say is at both 750ugs and 1.5mgs taken buccally I did not experience any form of visuals remotely close to something I experience on LSD. I didn't feel anything close to body euphoria although I'm not quite sure what people's definition of that really entails. If being on near-OD levels of heroin is a 10, and being sober is a 1, I really couldn't give 25I anything more than a 3 as far as "euphoria" goes. Maybe a little bit just from feeling so weird and expecting more to come of it as the trip progresses. Then you realize ***this is it*** and it slowly goes back to 1 until you actually dip into the zeros because your whole body feels like you just sat on the toilet for too long and got up too fast.

It's variable, the euphoria on 25I-NBOME, after about 3-4 hours into the trip, can be absolutely fantastic. The beginning can be really rough though, (i've dosed nasally)

I agree the the nbome's are more shallow or less moving than tryptamines, but they can be in certain cases.  usually they are just eye candy but one time it caused me to realize what the best moment of my life was.  so it might be limited to realizations that aren't very otherwordly or spiritually deep but more just about social subjects or your life, thats how ive experienced them

IMO on most occasions all trypt's are more spiritual and deep than PEA's. I've done 25i-nBOME on a number: f occasins, and the last time I did me and my friend took about 2mg accidentally. This led to my first actual bad trip, and my friend OD'd and just barely made it.

This is our fault though, and not the substances. I like nBome as we call it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Quick question.  No big deal if it is ruined as it was the remainder of my sample  only 4mg.  at anyrate, I kept this in vodka, in a tiny glass jar.  I put the jar in a bag and placed it into the freezer.  Long story short, I think the Vodka is now all on the side of the jar ...  in liquid droplet form and the tiny remainder of liquid is frozen.  It was NOT alot of liquid, and the bottom of the jar probably had too much space...to spread out.  about 2ml of liquid was in that Jar when I left in about oh 5 months ago.  


Since the Vodka evaps....  but then recondensed  ...  Now on the sides of the jar....    that would mean my 25I is now frozen in water correct?  anyone ever have this?  I would think the crystals in the water have destroyed the molecular structure of the 25I but maybe I am wrong...

Well, it is only 4mg like I said.  I know that,  I also know a tiny bit of my 2ml evaporated already, prior to me capping it and placeing it in the freezer.  This possibly aided in the transformation to ice.


I just Vodka doesn't really freeze, at least not in a normal freezer.

You're right but I don't think that means the 25I was destroyed just probably separated.

There are tons of Magnesium supplements out there. They are not all equal, many that are cheep have little to no Bio-availability.   In general, organic forms of magnesium such as magnesium citrate, magnesium succinate. are well-absorbed forms.


Go to a GNC, or a Vitamin store,  stay away from Magnesium OXIDE -  low bioavailability, basicaly cheep stuff with Magnesium legaly in the name but not very good for you.  Most people in the US already have a magnesium difficiency, due to the foods you eat.  It may help with the Jawclench.  I have never suffered from this on 25I, but my wife did have a little bit of it right into the peak her first time

I don't believe it is scheduled, but the government isn't really good at chemistry; they'll use the Federal Analog Act to bust whatever they please. So though its technically legal, I wouldn't doubt that one could be arrested because of it.

lately there's been enough high-media-profile busts/deaths for various NBOMes that IMO its a dangerous one to possess legally at the moment


just don't sell it to anyone or go to the hospital, though, and people on the end-user level should be fine for the time being

He guys, Any of you have that sickness nausea at the beginning of the trip? I always have it when took 25i... just avoided it 2 times: one because it was a very low dose(300ug) i think, and other time that I took the blotter and later made a really long walking up a mountain, and at the end of it smoked a joint, it that moment I realized I was already tripping without suffering side effects (so was the physical activity or the joint that avoid the nausea)


Do you have any tricks? I have read of ginger for 2c nausea, I will try it next time

Hey bros, wanna first just say thanks to everyone who makes this forum work.. awesome information to be had here.


Anyway, I've recently purchased 10mg of 25i-nbome after some research. Having only ever done mushrooms and bunk LSD a few times as a teen (save for one night where I candyflipped and Im pretty sure it was legit then) and it being quite a while since I wanted to branch out and try something new. I had always heard of the 2c family but never was able to get my hands on any through anyone I knew. I wish I had known they were still legal here in canada as RC's up until even a few years ago.. but I digress. Since I have no means of finding LSD anymore ive looked to this. I've had some really really intense mushroom trips before and while my world was turned upside down with total ego loss and so on, I never felt that they were visually what I really was looking for. I am really looking forward to the OEVs and I like the fact that its not supposed to be as heavy mentally as other psychadelics.


Anyway, after much reading I am doing to dilute the 10mg in a 2ml 50/50 mix of distilled water and 40%abv vodka and then use an oral or insulin syringe to nasally administer 750ug's


I know some people have had some effects at 500ugs and that is a reccomended starting point, but I am fairly confident in my ability to handle myself in a mental aspect. From what I've gatehered reading through all the B&D threads on this substance the people who have had problems have massively overdosed in the first place and the majority who took 500-750ugs didn't really feel all that much. Based on that, I know within 15~ mins I should be really feeling the drug with a steady climb to climax at the 1 hour mark.. so if by 30-45mins I am not really feeling like its progressing to the extent that I will manage OEVs, and as long as I am feeling okay, I plan to take an additional 250-500ugs.


By dosing nasally with a solution of the hcl salt a lot of the unknown is taken out of the equation from the buccal administration which has been known to not dose correctly, and/or to take a while to come on, and many people, having redosed at the hour mark or so have found out an hour later that they took way too much and ended up having a bad time.. so by going nasally I should get a pretty good indication of whats going on.


Anyone have any gripes or inputs with this? I will be taking it at home in the evening, a very calm scenario for me, nothing crazy like going outside.. from all my previous trip experience I know what I like as far as environment so Im fairly confident Ill be able to handle whatever mental shit is thrown my way.


Any comments appreciated! thanks!

Sounds like a plan!  Just wanted to let you know that it sounds like you're doing everything right.  Also just to let you know, you might not be able to see any signs of visuals at 30-45 min.  The real visuals for me took over an hour to start, but however after about 20 minutes after dosing I did get some strange visual disturbance.

The nassal dose and the buccal dose isnt the same, please check about that... a little dose is going to be stronger nasally.

Thanks. I've actually decided in the past few days after reading more (since I still don't have product) that I am just going to start with 500ug and go with that. I will only redose if at the 45~min mark nothing really seems to be happening at all. 500ug seems to be plenty for a lot of people, and I suspect those requiring higher doses are also people who trip fairly often who have a higher 'baseline' tolerance than their *true* baseline - if that makes any sense. This is of course a hunch and only part of the wide range of doses.

While yes in general you are right, there are a few things I'd like to point out based on what I have read (the large majority of all the archived B&Ds, trip reports and so on)


In a non-complexed form, nasal is stronger, but the reason for this is the poor bioavailability. However, there are many reports of people taking complexed blotters and having similar come up speeds and effects in comparison to those snorting. I think at this point its fairly safe to say that most all blotters are complexed. Those noticing drastic differences between nasal vs bucal are those using the same 'form' for each method, eg squiting .1ml solution into the nose vs squiring it into the mouth and trying to hold it there.

However even complexed, the buccal administration employs many more variables and unknowns which affect the absorbtion rate.


In any case, even if the nasal dose is stronger, which is easy to believe since snorting vs swallowing/sublingual administration results in stronger/shorter affects for most but not all drugs, I feel that given the two available methods of dosing (leaving plugging or vaping out as those are least desireable for myself and many) that dosing nasally is the best way to ensure a level of control over your actual dose that can be repeated.


thank you for your concern ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have nothing to complex but I find uncomplexed blotters work for me but for some test subjects they don't I think it has something to do with gum health possibly.

Took some last night (~800ug nasal), was a beautiful trip - this is such a powerful substance! Had to calm myself down at the beginning because it's quite an overwhelming feeling of anxiety. The stimulation is very strong and lasts for hours, don't plan on sleeping in the following 10+ hours after you dose. 


Music appreciation was off the charts and euphoria, and enhanced tactile sensations were very strong. Visuals were highly prominent and beautiful. 


I've learned not to push the boundaries in terms of dosage - the intensity ramps up exponentially with dose. Set and setting are very important - it's very overwhelming for the psychedelically naive so watch out. This is one to be respected.

I've had a slightly strange experience with this.


Previous psychedelic experience: LSD 6-7 times in doses between 70ug and 160ug, 2C-B one time at 20mg, MDMA a bunch of time but nothing psychedelic, cannabis occasionally (I have experienced mild color enhancement and some minor CEV on cannabis but obviously nothing even close to LSD)


I have 1.2mg tabs of 25i-NBOMe HCL, and cut one up into small pieces. The first time I tried a dose of ~100ug (+- 50ug assuming the 25i was evenly distributed). I held the blotter against my gums and did not swallow any spit for 15mins. As expected, this was barely threshold, I did notice a slight body buzz and some minor increase in concept recognition (seeing a resemblance to faces in wood grain for example).

The second time I tried ~300ug several weeks later (although I did have an LSD trip 7 days before, but essentially my tolerance was fully down). This time I held the blotter under my tongue with all my saliva for a full 20mins before swallowing. This experience evolved as expected, very mild some "breathing" visuals and a more intense but still quite mild body high. Around 6-7 hours dosing the effects were still very mild but noticeable. At this point, I smoked some weed. I had not smoked for probably around a month so my tolerance is low. Around 10mins after smoking the joint things started kicking off:


I started seeing full blown 3D visuals, mostly words or multi-color geometric structures. I had quite extreme time dilation, and felt like everything was in stop motion, I also felt when walking that I kept being jumped back in time every few seconds (it felt like i was in a recurring loop, always walking forwards but kept being placed back to where I started walking from). It became impossible to act normally and I wasn't really able to talk very coherently despite being mentally quite clear. There were significant audio effects (cars seemed to go past very slowly because of time dilation and the noise of the engines was pitch shifted down into a slow, low drone). At one point the voice of my thoughts became incredibly real, almost like I could really hear it, and I was able to say things in my head in different voices and they sounded extremely life-like. When eating a choc-ice I could hear the crunching very loudly, and also it felt like I was chewing lego blocks or something, it felt like my tongue/teeth etc. were moving very slowly (possibly just the time dilation) and my tongue felt very strange in my mouth (on LSD I've also had a similar but less intense feeling that my tongue is weird in my mouth). Walking back home the perspiration on the road (it was night-time) appeared to me as random words in 3D standing up from the road. I was able to look directly at these 3D visuals and they were not constantly changing like my experiences on LSD. The effects lasted for perhaps 2 hours after smoking the weed before starting to diminish and I was finally able to sleep. This trip was waaay more intense than expected and I was quite anxiety ridden towards the end because I got worried about vasoconstriction (my hands were a little cold and I had a pain in my chest, although this pain is still there for the day afterwards and may just be coincidental since I actually have a recovering shoulder injury for which I am stretching my chest a lot).


I would recommend being cautious with this substance, it looks like a lot of people are jumping in at 1mg+ and I can't even imagine the effects for me if this was combined with cannabis, since on my 300ug dose I smoked the weed after 6-7 hours so should be past the peek but still had such a massive effect. I intend to try 25i again with less than 300ug and no cannabis, but if it looks like the pain in my chest was indeed related to the drug then obviously I will not take it again.

it seems like your tolerance to this subtance is really low... It was good for you staring with a low dose

a friend of mine took 300 hg and he said that he didnt experiment anything

Thanks for the report d8rken.. perhaps I should start with 300ug. I don't want to rush it, but at the same time I don't want to just feel threshold effects and then have to wait two weeks.

The pain in your chest probably was related.  The good news is that most phenethylamines do this and it's not a dangerous thing, worrisome as it may be.  You may wish to try 25C, for me it is a much less physical, much more visual and psychedelic experience.  25I just feels like insane energy and even ego boost.  25I is a party drug, and 25C feels like MDMA is described except with super-saiyan LSD visuals.

NBOMe-2C chems are primarily visual. That being said, I've probably gotten the strongest visuals and euphoria on them I have felt on any psychedelic. Also, at high doses, they take on a completely different character and can be totally mind-blowing. Especially with any cannabinoids or cannabis involved.


My strongest trip on them has been with 1.2mg of 25C.. i've tried 25B and 25I also. Anyways, I dosed by placing 2 600ug blotters inside of my nose. Within an hour the entire room around me was morphing and waving and the visuals were rapidly increasing in intensity, and that's when I decided to hit the bong (when I look back on it I didn't need it because the 25C on its own was already very intense). I totally lost sense of time, where I was, thought loops etc. accompanied by the most bizarre and vivid hallucinations, including my dog turning into a monster and the lights turning themselves on and off without touching the lightswitches. Luckily I was able to control my anxiety and it ended up being a good trip. There were positive aspects to the trip, very strong euphoria, incredibly intricate patterns and 3D objects covering my entire vision. I did get minor vasoconstriction, it was easily manageable though and I suspect the cannabis alleviated it a bit.

I agree, they most certainly *do* have mindfuck. It's controllable at low levels, or if you're experienced, but at higher dosages it can easily overwhelm, and I've seen some heavy freakouts on it.

This is pretty reminiscent of my own experiences at 1.2/1.3mg, without any weed (I don't smoke). I use liquid measurement dried on a small strip of paper towel for buccal dosing and at this dosage they're consistently a high +3/sometimes +4 with vivid hallucinations and moments of confusion like you describe. For a more recreational and relaxed trip I prefer to do around 0.8 to 1mg. The dosage curve goes up exponentially with this substance (like many other research chemicals) and 200ug increments in dose can definitely take things to the next level. Judging from reports over the past year, a lot of the blotter that's been going around seems to be inconsistently laid and can vary quite a bit in actual dosage, which is why I prefer to make my own.

Hazel, Had you studied the difference between a blotter nasally and bucal? Can you tell us how exactly did you put the blotter in your nose?

It's best to place the blotter in a small amount (enough to submerse them, but not so much that you'll end up losing your dose because of drip) of distilled water and let them sit there for a while. Then squirt that water up your nose with an oral syringe.

Nope, but that's what a couple of users did in the previous threads and it did work out for them. Maybe you need alcohol though (the accounts I read used vodka or grain alcohol, but those are not things you want to put in your nose)

Yeah everyone uses diluted vodka down to 10 or 20% and snorts that. Ideally you're snorting such a minute amount of water, .1-.2ml that its not going to be that bad. I'll let you know this weekend my experience ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Snorting a tiny amount of liquid is not so bad.  But for a first timer I would never recomend this route.  Effects come on almost instanteously.  Even though the taste is awful I recomend a persons first test of this substance should always be sublingual/buccal.  The only time I did it I snorted roughly 500 to 600 mics after I already very comfy in 1 mg trip.  I broke it up into 3 tiny droplets, and let the Vodka Evap just a bit.  Expect a hot cold tingly sensation.  Now it is hard for me to trully guage what the true effects were since I was already tripping,  BUT....  it was pretty instantaneous, and the visuals not only intensified with clarity but with movement as well within a few seconds.


Everone is different but the idea of taking something a being full fledged into a trip in minutes seems daunting to me.

Sorry, I havent had time to read whole thread, so sorry If it's already been answered, but will SSRI's (namely LUVOX - Fluvoxamine) affect the effects the of this substance as it does to other psychadelics especially LSD. I get nothing from LSD because of SSRI's.. Thanks

This is not how it is when you're not already tripping.  It does take awhile for it to really get going, for me at least.


To Azron, I would expect the effects to be so much weaker that it wouldn't be worth trying.  Wait until you can get that chemical lobotomy out of your brain completely before you use any psychedelics.

infant I have to say man you really inspired me to try my remaining 25I nasally using the vodka method


but I'm supposed to be taking mdma real soon so it will have to wait a bit because I'm not 100% positive it would effect that, but I'm also not trying to take any chances with a RC over legit MDMA


maybe in like two weeks time I will try this


the only thing I'm trying to figure out is how to dose it, because there's 750ugs on each tab and I got two left but 750 seems like a tad high for a new ROA but at the same time I'm not trying to waste my time either

If you have them in tabs its probably just best to leave as tabs, I had a powder so had to dilute to get the dose right. Seems like a big headache to try to get the substance out of a tab, and you're likely to lose some along the way.


I will say it was pretty intense, but not like 10 mins and you're full blown tripping like some people said, it took upwards of an hour+ to reach the peak effects. Visually I got some mild tracers, faint patterning that was ghostlike, like an overlay and some morphing. CEVs werent extreme but they were there and I understand what people mean by "digital" very bright happy colours, blues, yellows, pink. Mentally I was all there, but for the first two hours I kept getting crazy euphoric rushes where I had to stop for a second and breath. By 3 hours in I was on the way down and now I honestly feel almost as if I took nothing last night at all. At no point did I feel like the trip could go in any negative direction at all, I just felt amazing the whole time. However, I did get some intestinal distress and ended up on the throne for a while and that was the strangest.. indigestion while tripping.. it felt like a bomb went off inside of my intestines.. was not pleasant at all. At no point was vasoconstriction an issue, but my weiner did turn into am overcooked noodle for all intents and purposes so it was definitely present. I was at home the whole time, but I definitely feel like this is something you could take at a concert or show or whatever around a lot of people and have an amazing time.


that was 400ug


going to step to 600ug the next time, maybe more. I know what to expect now at least, I feel like what I got was pretty threshold, but it was still a good time and all in all I am very glad I tried it.

Shimazu: While there is a heck of a lot of serotonin downregulation with the NBOMes (see: tolerance), IME it doesn't really affect the MDMA experience. Maybe you get less MDMA-induced visuals or something, but that's not what you're aiming for with your roll probably.


As for dosage, it seems a bit more potent, but that could easily be improper absorption from sublingual. I guess your only "concern" should be the come-up time, but it's not rough at all just very short. Just takes some getting used to. Anyway, if you're fine with 750ug from sublingual then that's probably the same for nasal too.

I was under the impression leaving the tab in a little bit of vodka and water would release the chemicals into it and I could just drop the small amount of liquid into my nose.


I'll admit I dont know too much about any of the nbomes but I just would rather not mess with my brain anymore than I have to after waiting 2 months already especially since you never know if you could have a bad trip or something and I would rather just wait a bit to keep everything in line mentally

Yeah Ive heard of doing that too, but the amount of liquid for snorting is so minute that it may be hard to soak the blotter entirely and leech out everything? I did some tests and .2ml was about the most liquid my nose could handle before it started dripping down the back or trying to run out, which really is very little..


I would wait as well, save your brain for your roll :D


I had heard people talk about it feeling somewhat MDMAish but I honestly cannot beleive how intense the rushes were for me, very strong body high.. I can only imagine taking a real dose.


Its Canada day and I am considering taking it again this evening.. I know I did it on saturday and there will be some tolerance, but I feel comfortable with the duration and I know that I would be down and able to sleep about 6 hours after dosing...


It was a lot of fun and I really want to push it further and see where the visuals can end up.. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

You'd have to get a LARGE dose going to get any real effects and if you do this more often you'll end up with a mess of a receptor system. Had tolerance issues and itches for over month after my 25c binge.

Yeah I know that playing with tolerance dosing is like playing with fire. I don't have any intentions of binging, unless you consider twice in three days binging, but I get what you're saying.


I honestly feel no ill effects whatsoever, it was extremely clean on my system. Could just be because the dose was really low though.

Was just pointing out where such behavior might lead to, especially once you start treating it like a stimulant. There's a reason why everytime you come with anti-HR questions everyone becomes [Darth Vader](http://nooooooooooooooo.com/) ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


And yeah, IME the NBOMes aren't toxic feeling either. Might not feel as benign as LSD, but certainly not bad. Once dosages go higher then vasoconstriction kicks in and I've had leg tremors, but a lot of safer chemicals can be much worse

I did notice vasoconstriction in the sense that the veins on my arms/hands that are usually very visible became almost non existent. Didnt present any problems though such as cold hands or numbness or what have you


And as much as I felt like it was an mdma like stimulation, I didnt have any problems with hot or cold flashes or sweating or tremors anything of the sort.  I was actually really surprised at it, I enjoyed it a lot lol.. once I kick up the dosage if the visuals come in as well as Ive read and no real negatives present themselves I may just have a huge winner on my hands because its almost everything I am looking for.


If I had absolutely nothing to do with myself and no life I could see it presenting a problem, just doing it to cure boredom, but fortunately I have shit I have to get done to survive lol ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

It is only causing damage in the terms of other psychedelic trips afterwards.  You won't notice any damage but you may notice your trips are less profound, maybe it won't be so bad that you actually notice but still.. best not to abuse your receptors and be at the point where you only get decent visuals from an nbome.

I realize that there is tolerance and cross tolerance issues with really any psychadelic, and I realize that the NBOMes seem to have a much longer lasting tolerance for whatever reason - but do you have any evidence or any sort of science behind the claim that you can "abuse your receptors and be at the point where you only get decent visuals from an nbome"?


I think we can all agree that it is no good to abuse any drug but you're implying long term and/or permanent changes where you only get decent visuals from an nbome from that point on. Why are nbomes special in this regard that you may end up only being able to get visuals from nbomes? 


I dont mean to call you out but I don't quite understand your logic

There are no studies on that, no, but anecdotal data seems to suggest that things can get messy. Check out [this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/631991-NBOMe-Subthread-Tolerance) thread for example, and there's bound to be more sounds like that in the older B&Ds

I understand that there are no studies, I meant anecdotal evidence. I also understand that the issue of tolerance is very real and seems to be more extended with the nbomes, but the idea that if you do enough nbome you'll end up at a point where only nbomes give you visuals sounds like a load of hooey to me really. I read that thread before and there isnt any talk of this perma tolerance to other drugs from an nbome.


I'm no neuroscientist nor do I really have a true understanding of how receptors are targetted but it just kinda makes no sense to me. I understand that there are theories that since the nbomes (at least 25i) is a full agonist of the 5ht2 receptors it 'desensitizes' (for lack of better word) longer than other compounds that don't act on them completely, in effect I guess diminishing the effects from other compounds that arent full agonists even further. But to me this just sounds like you have to let the tolerance diminish, not that there will be anything *permanent*. Also given the fact that other receptors play a role in visuals and psychadelia in general, it would seem to me that if anything the opposite would be true: nbome 'abuse' would lead to reduction in nbome visuals/effects, whereas other compounds that target several receptors would still produce their intended effects however still on a diminished scale due to the cross tolerance.


In any case it really doesn't matter, I'm just intrigued as to how he came to that conclusion, what his thought process was behind it.

Okay man.  You want a study?  I have the best study of all, personal experience.  I haven't got nearly as complex visuals since I've abused the class, especially not from regular phenethylamines.


It has nothing to do with receptor downregulation I think... there's something else causing these visual symptoms.  Reduced visuals and persisting visuals.  It's just slightly shitty.


The reason I don't think it has to do with downregulation is because I've waited more than long enough to reduce all 5-HT tolerance and yet the symptoms persist.

and yes psychedelics desensitize them.  It feels like nbomes fry them.

To the bold, I'm no neuroscientist either, but that's not how it works for most psychedelics.  You need the 5-ht2a action for a real trip.

So Friday night, 6~ days after my 400ug dose I decided to up the ante and I went with an 800ug dose. I won't get into extreme details here, I'm probably going to write a trip report but I wanted to post some of my findings in this thread.


This was the most visually and physically intense psychedelic experience of my life. It was truly amazing. My only gripe was the body load for the first hour, it was really, really intense. 400ug was like MDMA to me but with 800ug I couldnt sit still, I went through waves each lasting maybe a minute or two each of nausea (didnt puke) or severe muscle tension. With 400ug I remarked at one point I felt like I could feel each individual muscle fibre tensing at once - the same thing happened on 800ug, but x10 - I can see why people may have seizures on this stuff. It was like every muscle in my body was firing as I lay on my bed. I could calm myself but the stimulation had me tensing up again.


Anyway I dosed 400ug and then 400ug another 10 mins later, and went to play the guitar, by 20-30 mins in things were starting to move, lots of morphing. I kept going back and forth between my guitar, my computer and my bedroom, I truly couldnt sit still and focus, I tried to with music but what felt like 30 mins was only more like 5.. every time I went into my computer room the effects seemed to intensify, my monitor moved off my desk at one point, the walls around me were shimmering and greens and blues overtaking the natural colours of mostly everything. I saw my first real tracers ever, I was on my bed watching the ceiling swirl around and the walls shimmer in my peripheral when i moved my hand over my face and this big long trail was left.. it was so awesome. Playing guitar was amazing, with the first hour since every muscle inm y body was twitching guitar became hard to play, but after it settled down my focus was there, tehre was no loss of rhythm, I felt and could see the music with my eyes closed, I had a very enjoyable time, not to mention how cool it was watching my hand trail along the frets as I played. At this point I went for a long walk.. my god it was the most beautiful thing ever, the night was cast in brilliant blues and pinks and greens, the tree tops looked illuminated by a deep purplely blue starry sky, it was truely magical. I was smiling and laughing, I felt like I knew something that most people didn't. I encountered several groups of people and wasnt paranoid in the slightest unlike I would be on mushrooms..


Towards the comedown the CEVS got more intense and I saw colours I never knew existed.. some people have called these "digital" but I don't think that does them justice and I feel like that has a negative conotation to it.. no my cevs were highly vivid and organic flowing tendrils of colour, I can't put what I saw into words, but it was absolutely nothing like mushrooms at all, there was no patterning.


A bad neck/throat tension set in near the end, which I think is because I have been getting a bit of a sore throat, but it persisted until I managed to fall asleep some 7 hours later and lasted into half of the next day. it was rather annoying. I was way, way too stimulated, I felt restless and couldnt get comfortable in bed.


So overall this is absolutely my new favourite psychedelic and I don't think I will ever use mushrooms again. However, the come up by insufflating really is a rocket ship ride into outer space at the speed of light, it was intense as fuck.. nothing compared to 400ug. It wasn't anything I couldn't handle, but I couldn't imagine someone new to drugs being able to handle this with the same level of calm.. It also seems that as fast as the intensity of the trip sets in, it also goes away.. I could handle how mangled my world was for that first hour no problem, but after the 2 hour point thigns settled dramatically, by the time I was outside I didnt really notice the same morphing of patterns and drawings and what not, but the colour enhancement itself was stunning.. I may try to lay a paper towel 'blotter' for the next time. I'd like to increase the dose, but damn the come up is truly intense.. I'd also like to extend the peak if I can because like I said it seems to go as quickly as it comes ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

I insufflated God knows how much 2 hours ago. Pretty nice body high, but my heart feels uncomfortable which sketches me out a bit. I flushed the rest down the toilet as I realized it's really just inferior to lsd and I obviously am being too dangerous by not measuring it out correctly. Well, here's hoping to live to see tomorrow lol. Visuals are pretty decent though, so that's a plus. I swear to fuck if my hppd gets worse after this (of course in the hypothetical scenario I live haha) Also, I find this headspace thoroughly unenlightening compared to acid. Tomorrow I will post something if all ends well. If not then assume le worst.

I wonder weather nbomes are true psychedelics or weather it depends on ones opinion of what a psychedelic is.. 25i has the visuals but lacks something that im not experienced enough to know what it is, yet am aware of its non-existance

Any of you guys ever get a liver profile done after using this? 


I don't drink alcohol and I hadn't used any other drugs in a month. I dropped some 25I on a Saturday night in early 2012. Next week I had the liver profile, and my ALT was too high. They asked if I was an alcoholic. 


I came home and hopped on BL and sure enough another user reported the same thing in a B&D thread. 


Now there are many things can cause liver damage -  OTC meds like Tylenol, for example, so by no means am I saying the 25I was responsible. However I haven't touched an NBOME since and my follow up test was perfectly fine. 


This is something we should keep an eye on and just be wary if a trend emerges. 2 people is not enough to worry, but 20 might be.

Only buccal/sublingual seems to be dangerously inconsistent. 


Granted I only have experience dosing twice nasally, you have far more than me, that I do concede.. but the inconsistencies were the reason I chose to go nasal despite all the warnings I had about it being a very intense come up - and they were right, it is intense. I cannot imagine how intense it would be going IV.

You're pretty much right, however I feel the increased intensity from nasal or say IV usage would make it only safer, as you could easily gauge how intense it is going to be compared to your past experiences with these ROAs.  Nasal is closer to IVing in this regard than sub/buc so I definitely see responsible nasal and IV usage as the safest ways to do this compound.  Plus with these fast-acting methods it would be easy to redose before your tolerance was too high if the effects are lacking.


Then again, no one should do what I'm saying unless you're a professional.  I doubt I'll ever inject 25I-NBOME in my life.

Eh, I've never had any problems with consistency in the ~25 trials I've done. But I've been only making a single dose at a time, I haven't tried to lay an entire sheet all at once.

The inconsistency comes with inexperience in the administration of these, although yes sometimes blotters can be also.

Well, from what I've heard (at the moment untested) the intensity of the come up is drawn out when you dose sublingually.. for me my 25i come ups have been super intense. Not visually, but just the body load I get. There is a distinct point where for me it feels like I can feel each individual muscle fibre all over my entire body firing, spasming almost. It literally is a rocket ship ride into a trip. I can only imagine this getting stronger were I to move to IVing. Nasal is closer to IV than sub/buc but IM is more of a closer comparison. Every drug I know of that can be taken multiple ways takes on a whole other element once you move to IV. If the user who mentioned it can handle it then more power to them.. I just don't think I'd be able to. I want to push my dose higher, but the body load I speak of doubled in intensity when I upped my dose.

Well, thats just what I gleaned from all the threads about the nbomes. Certainly its not the only factor, but differing physiology's, poorly laid blotters, and so on and so forth. With how dangerous the compound has apparently been for some I wanted to have total control over my dose, so I went with powder and I went with a nasal ROA.


However, the next time I try it, I am going to just squit it into my mouth or onto a piece of paper towel, as I want to see if sub/buc eases the rocket ship ride for me. In the mean time though, I have other stuff to try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

lol, whatever you say. Even using the word precise what you're saying still does not really make any sense. A slow absorption does not work in a precise way? How can affects be more precise than others?

Well with IV it doesn't need to get absorbed, which is why it's the most potent and cleanest way. It goes directly to where it needs to go in your body. Sure you can be against needles and draw the line for your drug usage there,  but you can't deny that it has it's positives. Judging people on their use of needles is just as stupid as being against synthetic drugs, stop the b.s

I've actually IVd  and IMd it. It's by far my favorite ROA for this substance. I'd say 1.3 mg IMd is equal to around 4mgs bucaly or intranasaly. Your catapulted in to +++ experience in like 2 minutes. And the overal duration is shorter. If you have acces to bacterioststic water and a micron filter I would def recommend this ROA.

^^those are in the high end of the doses I've done. 1.3 is the highest I've gone through IM, and 4.4 is the highest I've gone intranasaly. With those doses I felt I was in the verge of ODing. I was having weird muscle spasms in my thighs and was a lot less clear headed then I normally am on the stuff. I was just comparing effects of the 2 different ROAs. I'm not recommending those doses, just those ROAs. I could see how you read it like I was tho. . 900mcg is what I usually IM or some times 500 IM and 300 IV. I found when IMing alone it can sometimes take 5-10 minutes to get there vs 1 or 2 minutes IVing

I see, so you were saying an IM dose is about 3x stronger. So 0.8-0.9mg IM is probably about 2.4-2.7mg nasal/buccal for you? I couldn't imagine taking that much myself, but I know there's been a few other posters who said they were doing it in the 2-3mg range so it's not unreasonable if you're not as sensitive to the stuff as someone like me.

Even though they're so dangerous, for quite a few people they feel completely side effect free at the desired dose.  I'm one of those people.  I would consider IMing this stuff but not IVing, although I have vaporized which makes it get to the brain faster than IVing even.  Vaporizing this compound is a good way to use it and if spread throughout cannabis it is easy to know how much you're getting.

Yea I tend to have a fairly high natural tolerance towards a good bit of different psychedelics. Most of my friends I've given it to tend to react fairly strong in the 500 to 800mcg range bucaly sublingually or intranasaly

Smoked or Inhaled drugs enter the lungs and are quickly absorbed into the bloodstream through tiny vessels lining the air sacs. Smoke is created when a material is vaporized under heat to form a gas. As the gas spreads into the cooler surrounding air, it condenses into microscopic liquid droplets. These droplets catch the light and appear as visible smoke. Because of the very small size of the droplets, much smaller than dust particles, inhaled smoke continues all the way to the lung air sacs, where it comes into contact with the bloodstream and is quickly absorbed. Blood from the lungs continues to the heart and some of it is pumped directly to the brain.

TIME TO BRAIN: 7-10 seconds


Injecting: This is the most direct way to take a drug, but surprisingly not as fast as smoking. There are several methods of using a needle to inject a drug. It may be injected to a vein, into a muscle, or deep into the skin. If the drug is injected into a vein, the blood first returns to the right side of the heart. It then is pumped to the lungs, returned to the left side of the heart, and then pumped into the brain. The other types of injection spread the drug into other tissues. Blood bathing these tissues will eventually pick up the drug, return it to the heart, lungs, and heart again, and then carry it to the brain.

TIME TO BRAIN: 15-30 seconds if injected to a vein

3-5 minutes if injected into muscle or skin


Snorting: Drugs snorted into the nose are absorbed by blood vessels in the mucous membrans of the nasal passages. Although these blood bessels are very close to the brain, the drug-laden blood first returns to the heart, after which some of it is pumped back to reach the brain.

TIME TO BRIAN: 3-5 minutes


Contact: Some drugs can be absorbed directly through the skin, or mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth, vagina, or anus. Some people may take tiny LSD blotters and drop them into the space behind the lower eyelid, where the drug is rapidly absorbed. Liquid LSD can also be dropped into the eye, but this is seldom done.

TIME TO BRAIN: 3-5 minutes

Injesting: A drug that is eaten, drunk, or taken as a pill first passes down the esophagus to the stomach, where it is mixed with gastic fluids. It then moves on to the small intestine, where it is absorbed into the tiny blood vessels lining the walls. Intestinal blood goes to the liver, where the drug may be filtered out or altered. Blood from the liver then reaches the heart and is pumped to the brain. At any step along the way, the drug may be metabolized or degraded, making this method both the safest but also the slowest and least efficient way to take a drug.

**I have no idea if this information is actually true, but IME vaping and IV'ing 25I this seems to be spot on and not just 25I, it seems correct with ALL substances that I have used both ways. And the other ROA's mentioned seem correct IME.**

I would consider IMing this stuff but not IVing, although I have vaporized which makes it get to the brain faster than IVing even.  Vaporizing this compound is a good way to use it and if spread throughout cannabis it is easy to know how much you're getting.

Personally I've never smoked the stuff, but I don't see how it would reach the brain faster then IV. Though I'm interested in trying it. Do you know this by personal experimentation or from research you've done. If its from research could you please give more information on this subject?

Smoke is created when a material is vaporized under heat to form a gas. As the gas spreads into the cooler surrounding air, it condenses into microscopic liquid droplets. These droplets catch the light and appear as visible smoke. Because of the very small size of the droplets, much smaller than dust particles, inhaled smoke continues all the way to the lung air sacs, where it comes into contact with the bloodstream and is quickly absorbed. Blood from the lungs continues to the heart and some of it is pumped directly to the brain.

It then is pumped to the lungs, returned to the left side of the heart, and then pumped into the brain. The other types of injection spread the drug into other tissues. Blood bathing these tissues will eventually pick up the drug, return it to the heart, lungs, and heart again, and then carry it to the brain.

Azron, please let me know what happens. My blood test was about four days after I used 25I-NBOMe. Mine came from a GB that was tested to be ~90% 25I-NBOME, ~5% 2C-I if I recall correctly. I had complexed it with HPBCD, which was the style at the time.


edit: I should add that I don't have any health problems nor did I feel any lingering damage was done by the 25I. I just wanted to see if this had popped up as a trend among 25I enthusiasts in the last year and a half.

I just recently had the opportunity to try a pure nasal ROA.  400 micrograms or just shy of.  I let the alcohol dissolve off just a bit and then snorted it.  very little in the way of a burn.  it was kinda cool and refreshing, like peppermint.  Well....  not that pleasant.  anyway


Sublingual always hit me pretty quick  as in  within 20 minutes after the rinse and spit.  This hit me in 5 minutes.  Felt slightly altered, simple motor skills were just a bit odd to me.  The come up was quick but not overpowering and rather smooth.  


This is gonna sound weird to some but it is kinda like psychedelic cocaine.  Not that I redosed, although for a moment the urge was there. but I got a similar rush, and body high. I wanted to see where one simple dose would take me.  Felt pretty good mentally,  it was more visual at 400 mics then it was sublingually and the duration was about 3.5 hours.  Nothing too crazy,  but I did see some movement.  slight texture movement. It was mostly however mental and body euphoria.  I am quite accustomed to the body highs on 25I, for me it is an awesome aspect.  


Nasal ROA did fast forward my development so to speak.  In other words I would up feeling it so to speak in 10 minutes....  this let to a peak so to speak at the 1.5 hour mark.  


Where as with sublingual I would be feeling it in roughly 40 to 50 minutes from the time I put the dose under my tounge with a peak at 2.5 to 3 hour mark.  


Being mentally prepared was a key, I kinda expected to step into Bugatti Venron, instead I stepped into a really nice BMW 850 CI  and jumped to 120 mph. feel me?

WHen one talks about smoking or vaporizing I take it chaseing the dragon  ie   some tinfoil and a straw ( a method I employed to smoke cocaine ) would be plausible?


Although clearly great precaution would be a necessity.

IV is not the fastest way, but it is surely a lot less wasteful.  Waste isn't a big deal with something inexpensive like 25I, but it kind of is with something like heroin.  Smoking hits you faster because of the way your lungs work, but IVing will hit you a bit slower but it can hit a lot harder because there can be a lot more at once than what you could inhale.  Also yes, I've read something like what that guy posted, I know the time for inhaling is 7 seconds.  I've never compared IVing 25I to vaporizing it... I've only vaporized but I know it hits about that fast.  There's a general malaise with the act of smoking it off foil, I'd stick to mixing it with weed.


To Infantannihilator:  It's all good haha, was there something I was saying that you took issue with?  Because I don't mind a friendly discussion about differences on opinion, I know the NBOMEs in particular invoke lots of controversial opinions.


Weedazoid:  Smoking it off of foil works very well, probably better than mixed with cannabis.  However taste is bad and the whole act of doing it just has a wrong feeling... 25C feels a little bit better used this way even.  I suggest just mixing it with cannabis, it's far less gross and has less of an icky malaise.

hmm if you snorted it and it was enough your world should be upside down within 15-20. Maybe you just have a crazy natural tolerance compared to me? when I snorted 800ug I was mangled ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png) When I talked to you before that was only 400ug, it was really stimulating for me.

yeah idk dude theres a lot of different factors that could play into it


blotter might have had less than advertised


might not have let it sit long enough in the liquid (gave it a good half hour though)


might have used too much water to vodka


idk im feeling pretty fucked up though

yeah if done right it hits you hard and fast.  But 4 to 500 ug for me was more then manageable,  just faster and a bit more intense then sublingual doses at roughly the same amount.  


Infant....  I think you may just be a bit more sensitive to 25I then others, including myself.  Though I would think 750 ugs would be fairly intense within the 1 20 to 30  minute mark based on what I felt.  


I could feel the substance in my system in the first 5 minutes, but it was pleasant to me

Seems we're butting heads a lot huh? I didnt truly give any advice really, just relaying what I've come to learn from reading the board and my own personal experience. He said he wasn't really feeling anything by the 40 min mark, and his next post where he said he was feeling pretty fucked up was around an hour and 10 mins. Its hard to tell what he means by pretty fucked up, as even at my low dose with zero visuals I would say I was pretty fucked up. It taking an hour to hit you nasally is more in line with how long it takes to hit people taking this buccally from everything I have gathered. I did point out that maybe he has more of a natural tolerance, which I guess I hoped had implied that these substances affect everyone in a different way. The only way you could consider me to have given bad advice is if you read between the lines and put words in my mouth such as "you should be feeling it harder, go take more" which was not the case at all.

Yeah, thats what Ive figured. At 400ugs I noticed something within 15 mins, though it did take upwards of an hour for the full effects to build at that dose. I assume it was the same with the larger 800ug I took, but it was harder to tell because within those first 20 mins I was already well into it and so stimulated that it was difficult to keep my mind in one place for long enough to really take notes of what was going on. It did build continue to build but I was already off my chain. I do think perhaps I have a bit more sensitivity than others given the extreme stimulation Ive felt at 800ugs.


Anyway, I did a bit of an experiment today.


Last night I began to get one of my mega-headaches. I'm not sure if its a migraine, or what, but these usually render me writhing around on my bed, I end up puking and I want to kill myself because the pain in my head is that extreme. Its closer to a cluster headache from what I have read, but I don't fit the criteria for that simply because these continue to last for sometimes days on end. Anyway, I writhed around all night. I didn't have any ibuprofen or acetaminophen, nor any of my fancy migraine aborting pills, and I couldn't fathom the walk to the store (25mins).. I forget the brand of the migraine aborting pills Ive used in the past, all Iknow is they cost me $50 a pop - but they've worked. They've worked by vasoconstriction, and after reading a bit I noticed that they are 5ht2a agonists usually. So, having nothing to lose, I decided to take between 50-75ugs of 25i. I say between that amount because I was attempting to split the line on my isulin syringe; they are in 2 unit increments and I attempted to take 1 unit. This actually worked to some degree. The vasoconstriction kicked in and I felt the pressure on my head alleviate a little bit, though it was still there. I had some very faint closed eye patterning, morphing colours. Felt no stimulation and had no such oev or heightening of light/colour in that way. I managed to get comfortable at last and I think being able to focus on the close eye visuals helped to take the focus off my beating head. I eventually fell asleep and woke up this evening with a diminished headache, though still present. I am at the least able to get up and move around and do things at the moment, even was able to get to the store to get some ibuprofen.


Was interesting to say the least, it didn't help all that much, but it didn't hurt and was an interesting experience. So I guess from that you can say that my base threshold is about 50ug's.

I've never had it hit me hard and fast.  I snort the pure powder btw, I don't use a solution, so I don't think I can really do it any more right or get it any harder or faster except IVing.


to infantannihilator: it's fine I just wasn't sure what exactly you meant by the tone of it.  It was a bit of an overreaction on my part but I'm telling the truth, it takes over about an hour for any real effects besides a threshold vibe weirdness / cold brain feeling to happen.  and like I said, I snort pure powder.

Allow me to elaborate, my first several experiences were successful sublingual applications.  Only drawback was the taste, and numbness in my mouth. More the taste BUT using a 1 mg 25I   in .5ml Vodka    or   2 to 1 ratio it was pretty nice.  I also have access to the powder and a proper scale mind you. 


Snorting it brought the effects on rapidly.  where as sublingual was more like my experiences with LSD MDMA, and even mushroom.  where first effects are felt in that 20 to 30 minute zone and one kind of eases into the trip within that first hour.  


there is no easing in,  If anything the effects are felt rapidly, but the overall experience is pretty smooth.   First alerts are within the 5 to 7 minute marker,  with effects being fully developed ( for me ) within the first 20 minutes.  Into a peak by the hour point, and  a normal

**1.8ug 25i nbome**


Hello Everyone,


My cat was tripping on 1.2ug  25i nbome yesterday from 1.45 - peaking at 3.00 - 4.00 .. all was fine and dandy. This time round didn't have his favourite music around because he ended up getting stuck in his housemate room. Somehow this cat has become a little bit braver on 25i (done it 7 times so far with 2 week breaks in between and can now travel around and talk to people - usually debilitated). my cat is a bit emotional on this chemical. always crying, feeling super good. must some underlying mental illness bt he deals with it. 


anyway- this cat go risky. took half a tab (600ug)and shoved it up his lips. feeling cool, he sat around. and he sat up to type out to his friend - 'just put half a tab in, kick in now'


BAM! the most uncomfortable body sensation came over my friend. a combination of fear, adrenaline and the vascoconstriction going up to his head (he could hear those creaky noises of vessels seizing up) and ALL THE VISUALS WENT QUADRUPLE THE INTENSITY!!!!!! all chaos. 


25i hits this cat in waves. and during his peaks, he usually gets pretty cold/stiff, and with the extra 600ug, this cat wasn't feeling comfortable. in his discomfort, the cat went to get a sober friend told the friend about it, popped a benzo (good lord did the cat have shaky hands)...


20 minutes of self talk, open eye meditation (thank goodness this cat is a bikram yoga practitioner), deep breathing, and the trip sitter giving a back rub to calm down. the cat gets ready for the next wave of the 25i high to come - BAM! cat closes his eyes,... it is like a salvador dali picture, except multiplied by infinititi. circles and circles of sacred geometry. the cat could even see himself rising up and above these beautiful gorgeous patterns like he was a god of the world.it was thrilling, yet beautiful, and the cat cried for a while because it was so peaceful in this state of beautiful chaos.  then the cat opened his eyes.. and just looked at everything. the open eye visuals were ok, but they made the cat anxious.. closing his eyes eyes felt better - but again the visuals were too overwhelming. but the cats body felt like it was on electric.the cat's trip sitter was holding his hand, 


this is what my cat told me

"the visuals on 1.8ug were stunning. but the bodyload.. for me, was unbearable.. i dont know if i will do it again. the body load did not feel SAFE AT ALL. 

abit scry.. bt towards the end, everything was alright."


my cat binge ate the whole of today.. poor thing... ate everything he doesn't normally eat. cat is usually strictly vegetarian and grain free. but today ate white bread yad yada processed meats, donuts, junk....


what do you guys advise?

My advice is don't feed your cat drugs. It's animal cruelty. Or if you're talking about yourself, talk about yourself.

1.8ug? What? If you mean mg then yeah it's not uncommon at all, the coldness comes from vasoconstriction probably. With this chem I feel safe up to 1.2-1.5mg, now that doesn't translate to what's safe for you, but at least don't take 1.8mg doses again. Maybe if you supplement with magnesium then you can go higher with your doses, but please only up your dose in ~200ug increments from the highest dose you felt was safe.

Tried this at a festival on the weekend, this has to be mw new favourite drug, incredible euphoria, stimulation and visuals, I dosed 1mg for my first experience and it felt groovy, no nausea that im accustomed to with 2c-b, 2c-e, 2c-i etc. 

This was in no way comparable to 2C-I in fact for me it felt alot more like acid and the visuals were more acid like as well.

Cant wait to try 25B + C now! ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Ive IVd 25i and 25g mainly for the reason I believe it to be the most accurate way to dose and possibly the safest. I get to do my own prep, my own maths and when done properly is very accuratly measured by a syringe. This way I get an exact dose and there is no waiting time potentially saving me from an uncssicarly re-dose. Ive bought blotters of 25b and 25c and there is so much 'unknown' factors of someone preparing my dose for me. Also must say doses were always titrated and with proper injection techniques I believe to be a safe and accurate roa although I don not recommend people do it.

I cannot believe the amount of haters on this website for 25i. I joined this website after months of reading just so I could let off some steam about this drug. I am gonna educate those who do not know what they are talking about, or are just prejudiced because its an RC. 


1. (ITS NOT SAFE) everyone who has died on it either had an allergic reaction to it or died because they fell off a cliff or ran into a telephone pole repeatedly. Either way they were too stupid to go through a reputable dealer and do a threshold dose their first time. There is an alcohol related fatality like every 6 minutes or something. Give me a break. Anyone who does drugs and doesn't take precautions is doomed anyway.


2. (IT TASTES TERRIBLE AND MAKES ME NAUTIOUS) Boo-freakin-who. There is not a single serotonin receptor agonist that tastes like gum drops. If you like that kind of drug then you gotta man up. If you absolutely need to tuck it to do a drug then boof it, slam it, insufflate, parachute it, whatever. Ever snort MDMA? No one complains about the acrid shoots of lemon and salt that drip down the back of your throat, that make everyone vomit, but a cheaper drug that does more with less body load and everyone wants to cry about it.


3. (LAW ENFORCEMENT) I have two buddies went to a dead show and got 20 years for 2 sugar cubes with acid in them. NBO is only illegal if tried as an analog and to date there is only 2 people who went to jail because they gave it to someone and they died. That means you can buy it, possess it, do it, you just cant sell enough to piss off the fed. That's a no brainer. All hallucinogenic drugs are schedule 1 in the US. NBO is not. 


4. (THE TRIP) Is super clean, and most people only get sick if they haven't eaten that day. Great OEV and CEV, powerful auditory, the mdma euphoria... The list goes on. But you haters wanna knock it.


5. (TERRIBLE AND UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS OF AN RC)


POSITIVE


    strong open and closed eye visuals, including trails, color shifts, brightening, etc.

    mood lift

    euphoria

    mental and physical stimulation

    increase in associative & creative thinking

    increased awareness & appreciation of music

    life-changing spiritual experiences

    erotic, sexual thoughts and sensations

    feelings of love and empathy


NEUTRAL


    general change in consciousness

    pupil dilation

    difficulty focusing

    unusual body sensations (facial flushing, chills, goosebumps, body energy)

    change in perception of time, time dilation

    slight increase in heart rate

    yawning, especially when coming up

    does not suppress appetite


NEGATIVE


    (likelihood of negative side effects increases with higher doses)

    confusion

    looping

    scrambled communication

    nausea

    insomnia

    looping, recursive, out of control thinking

    paranoia, fear, and panic

    unwanted and overwhelming feelings

    unwanted life-changing spiritual experiences

    Vasoconstriction, peripheral numbness, swelling of feet, hands, face


the list is half as long as most other party drugs. Plus because the schedule debate is up right now there is a lot of new data suggesting that this drug is a permanent cure for chronic depression, non physical erectile dysfunction, arthritis, rheumatism, schizophrenia, and more findings emerge every day.[citation needed] How much testing do you think was done on acid before people accepted it as a festival drug and not an RC? MDMA was a mood stabilizer prescribed by doctors for 10 years before it became schedule 1. It had seen a lot of use since the 80's and we just in the last decade figured out it was super bad for you. If you think drugs are bad and they will mess you up then don't do them, but if you are smart and do your do diligence you will realize that the only effect this chemical has on your body chemistry-wise is acting as a powerful agonist on  the most important receptor in your brain for human wellness. This stuff makes you a happier person plain an simple, that's a fact. It is not going to give you tumors or tear apart your DNA, or give you cancer. 


In summation: 


          I absolutely love this drug. There is nothing else like it out there if you dig hallucinogens. It is ridiculously cheap (no price discussion), last the right amount of time, you can eat, sleep, and screw on it. It is non-addictive, not illegal, widely available in all forms, and has more health benefits than negatives.[citation needed] Plus because it is a  Phenethylamine it is absolutely perfect for candy-flipping. This is the perfect party hallucinogen. I don't get down really with the religious experiences with it, that's not what I use it for. That is reserved for mushrooms, but it is a good drug to party on. If you haven't tried it, do, at least once. If you have and you didn't like it, don't be objective, relate the whole experience. 


I will give you the perfect recipe for awesomeness:

No drug suggestions, especially if your tolerance makes you suggest unreasonably high dosages. 


           Also, for all of you who said you got it at a festival, its advertised as doses, not acid, plus there is soo much bunk at shows, just be greatfull you got to trip face and listen to music with friends and family. All Praise Cowboy and Gypsy.

I don't like it cuz it feels like I'm frying my brain when I do it.  Especially with that stupid combo you said.  No way am I combining 25I with meth, they already feel too similar.

^ Same. Way brain fry and stimulation and agree that combo is just nonsense and dangerous. Omg I'm imagining 5mg of 25I right now.


Littlebear13"**but if you are smart and do your do diligence you will realize that the only effect this chemical has on your body chemistry-wise is acting as a powerful agonist on the most important receptor in your brain for human wellness**. This stuff makes you a happier person plain an simple, that's a fact. It is not going to give you tumors or tear apart your DNA, or give you cancer."


littlebear13, is it really that smart??? To affect your body with powerful agonists of as you say the most important receptor for human wellness that you also said of "NBO is only illegal if tried as an analog and to date there is only 2 people who went to jail because they gave it to someone and they **died**." Just because it's not illegal yet doesn't make it safe. Especially at doses you suggested.


Thanks for the education. I dont hate Rc's, in fact I love a lot of them.

getting some of this stuff soon, only experience was some blotters that were supposed to be lsd a year ago. its powder form and ive seen people talk about diluting it with vodka or taking it orally/sub. any rec's for a starting dose and easiest way to not OD haha

[Dissolve your weighed substance in a known quantity of vodka, figure out how much you have per ml](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/286239-The-Big-amp-Dandy-Volumetric-Liquid-Measurement-thread) and then dose accordingly (start with 500ug, work your way up in increments of 200ug) As for the ROA, you can either dose sublingually or nasally, just eating a bunch doesn't work. Sublingual is better because there's a smaller chance of side-effects, but it's just a very annoying ROA as you don't want your NBOMe to end up in your stomach and you can't be sure how much you actually absorbed. Nasal is better in that respect, as you just squirt a bit of the solution in your nose. If you go for that latter, the concentration of your solution can't be too high (I have 2.5mg/ml, so that each 0.1ml has 250ug in it) because if you have too much, most of it will drip down in to your stomach. For all of this you need something that can accurately measure small volumes of water, like an oral syringe or something.

I have a liquid solution of this that is 10mg/ml. I have a spray that releases 0.10ml per spray. (its a medical nasal spray applicator so pretty reliable). While the nasal spray is very quick an efficient, it just irritates my nose too much. I have ended up just praying it under my tongue an holding it for around 20 minutes. While this takes longer and is more inconvenient, this has been the better option than ending up with red eyes and a runny nose for the next few hours.


I wonder if this irritates any one elses nose as much as mine. Its in a water complexed solution not alcohol.

How does the vasoconstriction compare on low and high doses? I took roughly 1/4 of a 1mg complexed blotter earlier today, not expecting anything (just a testing dose). It had much more effects than I'd expected, I even got slight visuals (which is even more impressive considering my huge dose of 2C-E 3 days ago). The vasoconstriction was noticeable too, though and while it wasn't all that bad, I'm a little worried how much it'll increase if I'd take a whole blotter. Will it get a lot worse, or just slightly? 


Will be taking the other 3/4 blotter (so ~750mg), in about two and a half weeks, before I move on to the 1mg, but still I'd like to know a little better what to expect. Usually I like to jump into the deep end with a drug right away, but with 25i causing all theses deaths (or at least, that's how it seems to me) I'm proceeding carefully with this one. The main reason I'm giving it a chance is that it's so unbelievably cheap, although visuals without too much of a mindfuck sounds attractive too.

what is in you water 'complexed'  with that keeps it from being attacked by micro organisms?  We tend to recommend alcohol because it not only dissolves it protects from airborn infection.


10mg of product to 1mg of liquid is quite dense,  even for a good ethanol solution.  If .10 ml of spray contains 1 mg of material, you should not be putting it up your nose.  


just my advice.

It shouldn't cause you any dangerous physical problems but I don't know how you react to it!  The fact you had such strong effects off of 250 mcg is strange though.

Why not? What difference does the concentration make? If anything the denser the better for putting up your nose as you don't have to worry about leakage, and for me personally .1ml was about the threshold at which my nose could retain the liquid.

I have mine dissolved in 0.5mg/0.1mL of ethanol. Works fantastically for nasal administration. Burns like a bitch for about a minute. I'm curious if I added lidocaine HCl to the solution if that would help. Problem is that I can only add about 10mg/0.1mL to the solution without worrying about either substance falling out of the solution. Would 10mg per dose be enough lidocaine to numb the burning?

In his paper about NBOMe's Casale is talking about 3 different types of for example 25B-NBOMe. 


John F. Casale*, Patrick A. Hays - Characterization of Eleven 2,5-Dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)phenethylamine (NBOMe) Derivatives and Differentiation from their 3- and 4-Methoxybenzyl Analogues - Part I 


He is talking about 25B-NB2OMe, 25B-NB3OMe, and 25B-NB4OMe. Does anybody have any idea if these have different effects? Which one is on the market? And how come nobody else is talking about the different types?

None of these analogues are on the market AFAIK. NB2OMe is what we have right now, where the others have that same bit which makes them an NBOMe at a different position (if you didn't guess it by now, my knowledge of chemistry is quite limited)

Since today I've been wondering the same thing. How do we know that NB2OMe is the one that's on the market? Afaik the labs in my country can't tell the difference. I am also curious to know what the differences might be.

How do Dutch labs test their chemicals? (hearing noises about reagent tests a bit too much, why would you need anyone else to do that?) The spectra are different so if they do any specific testing, then identification shouldn't be that hard right? 


Maybe too close to synth-discussion but if you need an entirely different route then there's no reason we'd have anything else then NB2OMe. If you don't and you need to separate the different NBxOMes, like you do with isomers, then there's a good chance we have a "racemic" mixture of sorts. Thinking out loud here but I hope I'm making sense here

GC-MS or LC-DAD if I am not mistaken. Reagents are only used in the testcenter I think. 


Usually it is quite difficult to differentiate between different isomeres (correct me if it is the wrong term) I heard. For example it isnt always easy to differentiate between 3-MMC and 4-MMC. 


Anybody else has an idea about the different options?

I would worry too much about overdose,  there isn't much room for error, if a bit of liquid evaps overtime all of a sudden you are at 1.2 to 1.5 mg for just one spray. 


I have had the opportunity to snort this stuff,  and my .2 ml contained around 500 mics.   Now granted I plopped it down on some glass, let the alcochol evap just a bit by blowing on it then snorted it up with a straw....  kinda like liquid cocaine.  


It was every interesting,  I expected less of a body high, because of a rapid absorption, but luckily this wasn't the case.  I know I could handle 1mg,  but seeing how 500 ug had some pretty powerful moments in that first hour, I would probably go to 800 mics. 


Now I am still just using a good oral syringe so that is why I say 'around' 800 mics  know way to know if I am maybe 50 to 100 mics off.  This is why I always try to stay on the shy side rather then the heavy side

What about making a slightly more diluted solution and applying the liquid dose to a small amount, say ~50 mg, of inert snortable powder carrier such as mannitol or inositol or whatever? Gives you the advantages of snorting a powder (no drip, less variance due to different droplet volumes) but not the usual risks of using a solid carrier such as hotpocketing?

If you start with a known mass of carrier powder in a baggie and always take use the exact same weighed mass and always take it from that baggie, you can even calculate the evaporation from your drug solution since the carrier powder does not evaporate.

If I understand right, the reason why the 25x compounds are inactive orally is because the BOH or BOMe is cleaved during first pass metabolism. What exact biology process is believed to be responsible for that?

I tried 25i-nbome about an year ago. JESUS CHRIST I so loved it, the euphoria was unmatched... maybe only by MDMA.


Visuals kinda like acid. I took around 1.5 mg and it was so fucking insane I had to take a bunch of xanax to abort my trip in the end. But until then I liked it. A lot.


Kind of felt like it puts a lot of strain on your heart... something that acid doesn't do.. And because of that I have not taken anymore.


Might try it again... someday.

A normal buccal dose for most of us is 0.5-1.5mg. People have had seizures with nasal doses at 3-4mg. Taking 30mg is likely suicidal if you get the full dose all at once, though there are a couple of users who claim to have taken that much and survived.

I have been with someone when they totally flipped on this stuff (6mg). I'm really glad no one died that night - it was one of those situations where it was becoming likely.

And you don't think 24mg would give a very reasonable expectation of death? I personally know someone who died from 2mg.


THIS IS FOOLISH AND IRRESPONSIBLE BEHAVIOR

still think that it's an underrated drug. Nice euphoria and body rushes, insane giggling fits and visuals. Three tabs over a night made for an incredibly fun, goofy, funny night.


still doesn't come close to the out of reality, mind fucking feeling LSD and AL-LAD gave me where I felt like I was in a whole other dimension, and it doesn't have the introspection and self analysis I got on aMT. But it was still a fun, entertaining drug.


and it's worth noting that although I didn't experience much mindfuck, it's still the only psychedelic to have given me synenthesia.

I'm really sorry psy997. I didn't mean it to sound like I would condone, or thought it was a good idea in any way. I apologise. 


I was not at a good point when I took that dosage - I do not think anyone should be doing what I did that night... That is what I did, and that was how I experienced it. I can confirm that it won't definitely kill you. But I can confirm it could.


This was extremely reckless behaviour.

Can I ask, why are you and your friends taking such insane doses? Even 6mg is waaaaay too much.

Sorry... These are 2 totally separate things. I took my dose, on my own, in my own flat.


TBH, I wouldn't say 6mg is too much.... it reallty does depend over what period of time you are taking it. (e.g. 6mg @ 1mg/tab = 1 each hour... for anyone that would be very different were it taken all at once). Quantity/time definitely does make a difference. I won't pretend to know enough to make any further judgement than that x @ once will not be the same as x/time.


Had I used 6mg over the period i used 24 over, I suspect I would have flicked between a little bit there, and fairly normal (Again, I would advise against but anything I might do to/with myself). 


I am very poor at expressing myself... and please don't take anything that I say as good advice if I ever talk about it, it's probably not a good idea. I *would* like to help people as may need advice or guidance, and my advice and guidance would be to yes, try it, but only buy one  tab/equiv.. Get to know, and understand it a bit.... but fuck... don't abuse it... it really is a bad idea. There are plenty of other things in this field to abuse in a much less dangerous and/or self destructive way. (This is ONLY my opninion)

How long do you wait between trips? Maybe your tolerance is a bit fucked, should be after this 24mg debacle anyway. And while spreading the doses out over time is certainly safer than taking it all at once, that still doesn't mean it's safe.


Seriously, be careful. Especially if you introduce someone else to this chemical. Don't even give them 1mg at once, half that is a good place to start.

I really know... that's where I really fucked up. So far, It has been the worse thing I have ever done to anyone I have known, even slightly. 


I have found that 2 weeks is a good time to loose the tolerance enough, and I don't do ANYTHING that often... and I have no particular area that I concentrate on. I'm a bit of an all-rounder with a medium tolerance for most things. I think I had 2mg about 4 weeks ago before my big one. 


YES... it DOESN'T... If you do a lot of something bad... it is bad (lot/little time or little/lot time). These ain't green vegetables... they *are not* good for you! health-wise. 


I think the likelihood of me EVER introduce or even use anything like this with someone else is pretty low. 


I'm no spokes person... but please... be better than I was.

Did 2mg for my first full-blown psychedelic experience. Have done Ketamine before but not a K-hole dose, and also DXM on multiple occasions (cry about it el oh el). I am a different person after that experience.. I am much happier after having recovered from a bout of severe depression, and every question I had has been answered. God, government, the human condition... it all makes sense. Except, more questions were created in the process of answering other questions... and I forgot most of the answers. I am also much closer to my best friend whom I tripped with. Any doubt we had left between each other was cleared up in that night. He took 3mg and experienced "mental OD" a few times, but overall, for us both, it was an intense, vivid, AMAZING transcendental experience.


Does anyone have any tips on the vasoconstriction? It's fairly annoying, especially the morning after when I went for a walk and felt very tight in the hamstrings and the nerves in my legs. I had "ghost pains" that I couldn't quite pinpoint the source of.


And does anyone have any tips on prepping for the trip? I know eating some decent meals beforehand and hydrating will help. The drug definitely was exhausting.

Don't do large doses. 


You're describing muscle contractions, btw, which is different from vasoconstriction. You'll notice the latter by cold, and later on blue colored extremities.

2mg,  3 mg,  these are very high doses of 25I.  and Honestly all you have to do is read and you can find ways to combat the Vasoconstriction, Magnesium supplements work and help.  But at 2mg you are kinda pushing your body.  Your friend is lucky he did not experience a physical OD at 3mg.   


This drug is not to be toyed with,  and it should not be abused.  


For me:  


1mg sublingually is fun giddy, goofy, euphoric, with powerful visuals, with an intense sensual/sexual pull  - Lasted 6 to 8 hours

-I did 1mg sublingually on 3 separate occaisions all with vary levels of great fun,  2 times generated some fantastic sexual fun for my wife and I.  While the 3rd occaision led to us walking and talking in the late afternoon and night. Something sensual began but never fully developed.   


.500 mg sublingually is warm and euphoric - lasted 4 hours

.500 mg sublingually on a different day was far more visual then expected - perhaps a set and setting thing/ expectation thing.  - Still only lasted 4 hours 


.400 mg nasal was a far faster come up,  lasted only 3 to 4 hours.  Come up was intense, but smoother then expected. It did not feel like the roller coaster I expected,  more like a fast car ride.......... Euphoria was noted,  Physcial high was slightly less intense into the peak. A nasal dose essentially drops you into your peak in roughly a half hours time. 


I am curious to see what a bit more up my nose would be like.   I would probably stay under .700 mg  to be safe though....especially for the initial dose, with the possibility of a small redoes in my head    


I have had many fun experiences on a vast amount of *candy* in my younger years and this stuff is similar on some physical level to MDMA.  JUST like MDMA more does not equate to BETER....   MORE equates to trouble.  I never did 2C-I  but from what I have read More  is not a good thing with the base chemical either


Keep all of these things in mind and DO not make the mistake of comparing it to classic psychadelics, such as LSD, which has a much wide margin for experimentation.  


The first time I touched this stuff the vasco was noticed and it was only .500 mg  sublingually.  Since then making sure I have enough magnesium in my system helps,  there are foods that you can eat that are high in magnesium  -  sweet potatoes, brown rice, almonds, coconut milk, soy milk, dark chocolate are basic examples of food I eat leading up to a planned 25I fund day/night. Or you can just go to a vitamin store and buy a supplement.  Magnesium helps support your nervous system and maintains healthy muscles with.

A couple notes:


With 2C-I more is better.


A nasal dose does not drop you into the peak in 30 minutes, or even an hour.  This advice is going to kill someone.  From my personal experience it may take 2 Full hours to feel it really start, not to mention how much stronger it may get in the peak.  If you don't feel it in 30 minutes and decide to redose, like I imagine one would knowing that "you'll be dropped in the peak in 30 minutes", you could easily overdose.

Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Three Synthetic Phenethylamines Into Schedule I


AGENCY: Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice.


ACTION: Notice of Intent.


SUMMARY: The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this notice of intent to temporarily schedule three synthetic phenethylamines into the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). The substances are 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25I-NBOMe; 2C-I-NBOMe; 25I; Cimbi-5), 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25C-NBOMe; 2C-C-NBOMe; 25C; Cimbi-82), and 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25B-NBOMe; 2C-B-NBOMe; 25B; Cimbi-36) [hereinafter 25I-NBOMe, 25C-NBOMe, and 25B-NBOMe]. This action is based on a finding by the Deputy Administrator that the placement of these synthetic phenethylamines into Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Any final order will be published in the Federal Register and may not be issued prior to November 12, 2013. Any final order will impose the administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions and regulatory controls applicable to Schedule I substances under the CSA on the manufacture, distribution, possession, importation, exportation, research, and conduct of instructional activities of these synthetic phenethylamines.

I could have sworn with 2C-I if say 25 to 30 mg was a solid dose, then 50 to 60 mg was perhaps overwhelming,  and anyting in the 75 to 90 mg range could be down right terrifying and dangerous physically if taken all at once.  


As far as the Nasal dose of fairly well concentrated 25I in Ethanol perhaps I should clarify....  FOR ME ....   effects seamed fully fleshed out in about a half hours time,  but that was a lower dose.   Perhaps it is quite different with anything over 500 ug.


If you are taking liquid up your nose and it is taking 2 hours for the effects to show themselves I think you are in the minority, but I suppose it is a valid point and I apologize. I know some report have people placing tabs inside the nose as well.  Not sure what your ROA was.   


This one has always had a fairly quick onset with me,  sublingual always worked it's way in so I knew what I was getting into by the first hour with with first alerts coming 20 minutes after the initial spit ball.  


And judging from what thenightwatch just displayed it looks like people will simply move on to 25I NBOH very soon.  or just shell out a bit more and get some LSZ,  or AL -LAD  or something else that the research chemists are working on right now


Happy trails

I snorted the powder into the nose so it's pretty much the most direct way you can get.  Although it is true that a liquid solution absorbs faster.


I think it just takes different amounts of time for different people.  It took a while for my trip to really kick up but it was extremely intense while being easily manageable.  The people describing it as too much or unbearable I have noticed had it kick in very fast usually.  Not sure what all this means but I think with some people they get a peak concentration of the drug in their brain faster than others who have a more steady flow, and naturally everyone is different in this regard.  I think these people that absorb the drug very quickly are at an increased risk for overdose.


All my information is just speculation gathered from experience and other's experiences.  No solid data.

Hello everyone, 


Can someone clarify the oral administration route for this RC? When mentioning 'buccal', is this to keep under the tongue for 1/2 hour or so - but does one swallow saliva during this time? I have a couple of 750mcg blotters, so insufflation isn't an option.


Also, is there a cross tolerance with 2C-C if dosing within three days of each other?

Try to swallow the saliva as less often as possible, as 25i is destroyed by first-pass metabolism. Brushing your mouth can help speed up absorption some. Anywhere in your mouth is fine as long as the saliva isn't swallowed much or the tab isn't swallowed, such as under the tongue or between the lip and gums, or the cheek and gums. Secure that shit and buckle up.

The week after doing 2mg, I did 3mg. The leftover tolerance from the week before alleviated much of the side effects and made me trip a little harder. It was a much laughter-filled trip. I seem to have some natural tolerance to "tripping" as I can handle a little more than most beginners without tripping as hard as them, which tends to be annoying. My friend is an extremely experienced tripper, including with this substance.


Funny story that induce much laughter, laughing to the point that I was crying... Sometimes I spend the night at my friend's house on the couch, in the living room next to the office room where the two computers on. My friend's stepfather (friend is going to college and still lives with parents) often stays up all night drinking and doing his own shit... well one night, my friend's awesome cat woke me up at 3:00AM and all I could hear was the sound of him jacking off in the next room... he did it for a good 10 mins and I eventually managed to fall back asleep, only to wake up at 6:00AM or so to the BIGGEST FUCKING EARTHSHATTERING FART I have ever heard in my life. Keeping in mind now, the house is one story and has only hardwood, so this shit completely echos through the whole house. A few seconds after he unleashed that monster of a fart, I said "Good morning." His reply was "Oh, uh, good mornin'. Want some breakfast?"

Imagine my disgust when he offered to make me breakfast with the same hands he used to-...


The week after (this past week actually), I did only 1mg. There did not seem to be much tolerance at all aside from the lack of side effects. I had a nice mid-level trip and smoked a lot of weed on it, and managed to enter a half-asleep state. Talk about weiiiirrrd trip-dreaming. Visuals less prominent on just one tab. There is no more of this substance left and I will not be able to trip on it for a while.

I have some 25i tabs, and I have a 15 hours party, I have taken 1 mg and the trip is lasted about 8 hours... If I take 1 mg after that time, it will afect me? or the tolerance is already created in the body? What metod do you thing I should use for a longer trip? Or should I just take another substance?

It will create a massive tolerance, making dosing another 25i or any other 25x chemical pretty useless (to me at least) and dosing other things a lot weaker.

Hoffmax,   yea we can't and shouldn't really give you too much advice.  In terms of harm reduction most people feel NBOMe's do not mix well with other stimulants, so be weary of that. plus I have no experiences with mixing this stuff with anything myself 


you have 15 hours to party, doesn't mean you have to party for 15 hours. 


Honestly if it were me, I would cruise in... get an assessment of your party vibe, and the people around you.  Chill, kill some time, listen to music eect...  ect.  then drop a tab. prepare a 2nd tab ahead of time and cut it into 4 bits.  this way you could slip yourself and upgrade through out the night,  and  space out .250 mg redoses, if you feel the need to make it last longer. 


the only issue is you will have to wrap your mind around a time issue,  and you may be too involved in yourself to contemplate holding the 1/4 tab in your gums or under your toung for 20 minutes.  


A redoes at the end of a full trip will do next to nothing IMO, at the same time doing 2mg all at once is not a smart move at all.  The only time I ever redosed I did it nasally in approximately .200 mg increments. in a vodka solution. But that was in a spa hotel room, not at a rave, or where ever you are going to be. 


It may have been a placebo but I felt like it intensified things just a bit and made the trip last a little longer.

My trip just ended a few hours ago and I really like this substance. The visuals were great, massive body high, lots of deep thoughts.


I started with 1mg, followed by 500ug 30 minutes later then 500ug an hour after that. So 2mg total. I'm actually surprised so many suggest that this is a very high dose. This was my first psychedelic trip(if you can call it that) of any sort and I handled it with ease.


I will say that I really dislike the muscle tension I get on 25i. I find it very difficult to let loose.

Some people are a good deal less sensitive to it.  Also, the 2 mg all at once instead of spaced out would have been 10x stronger.  The tolerance development is RAPID with this compound, and the extra .5 mgs added after your first dose and after your second are probably the equivalent strength to taking 1.25 mg all at once.  Surely, after development of tolerance with this compound I could do any gargantuan amount and the effect would be inert.

I've been really tired all the time since my trip 2 days ago. Sleeping on and off all day. Could this be side effects of the 25i? I really can't seem to stay awake.

Thanks for your response last week, Zhivili


I find with LSD, mushrooms and 2C-C that smoking weed synergises with the experience really nicely (I usually don't enjoy smoking pot any other time). Can the same be expected from 25i? Also enjoy a couple of drinks while I'm up to, and never had issue with other substances mixing with alcohol.

I don't know, maybe.  It feels odd to me that you would have after-effects like that after just 1 trip on it, I had became very tolerant to psychedelics and started to experience effects like that and I'm only in the past few months feeling like new again.  You may just be recovering from the excitement and stimulation and getting used to the non-breathtaking regular life.


and yes headcharge, weed will potentiate it nicely.  I didn't need it to correct the body load, as I do for many other psychedelics, it just enhanced the trip and the visuals.

So my SO and I have tried this twice.


We got it in tabs; 1000uG per tab.


The first time we did it we did 500uG to start and then another 500uG about 45 mins later. She got some mild visuals and a light body sensation, similar to a very mild 2c-b dose (maybe 7mg) (she's not taken 2c... but from her description that's the impression I got)... I got absolutely nothing at all, whatsoever.

We told the source about our not so impressive experience so they gave us another tab each.


This time we both did the tab in one. Held them under our tongue for 20 min or so. After about an hour or so, she started to get fuzzy visuals and mild 2C-esque effects. I started to get the body sensation similar to mushrooms or 2C; I tend to call it the "hollow" feeling but no visuals or anything else.

Well I guess to cut a long story short; for the whole durations she had mild visuals, tracers and the hollow body feeling; from her description I'd say similar to a very mild dose of 2C-b (10mg dose maybe). I on the other-hand, once again got sweet fuck all from it once again.

My body sensations left after an hour or 2 and I felt pretty normal, a mild euphoria I guess, but I don't know if that was the substance or the evening we were having together.

At 1 point I went to the loo and got a very very VERY mild wobbly wall effect out of the corner of my eye. I can't be sure if that was an extremely mild effect or a slight placebo. The reason I say placebo is because it was soooooooo very slight and brief that I don't even know if it happened or if it's just my usual stoner vision playing up.


An hour or 2 into it she started to get a little shaky, and a little frothy in the mouth which was a little concerning but ultimately was fine.


She got quite emotional on it, which isn't overly unusual, but more so than usual.


She said she'd take it again but if there's something else on offer then she'd go for something else.

Overall I'd rate it 3/10. I wont be taking it again; considering the dangers of it at high doses and the total lack of effects I experienced with it at what seems to be a moderate to high dose.

How did you take the tabs?  If they were complexed tabs 1mg should be enough, but if they weren't 1.5-2mg max is a good trip.


Tell your SO that she should take some supplements to counteract vasoconstriction, that will stop the shakes and foamy mouth

Sorry; what's meant by "complexed tabs"?


The friends I got them from both experience nice effects at the 1kug level. Perhaps this stuff just doesn't compliment my chemical make-up or something. 


I'd maybe go to 1.5kug; but to be honest, hearing what others have experienced with it; I think I'd rather just stick with 2C-x. I don't feel like I'm missing out on any new wonderful adventure that 25I will take me on.


Any advice on which supplements? Or would a multi-vitamin tablet do the job?

Thanks for the advice ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I haven't gotten a trip off em yet I think due to always being fucked up on dope.  I noticed some visuals while standing in line at walgreens; weirded me out because there were absolutely no psychological effects.


I have a question about blotter preservation, the powder on the stuff I have seems to leave a print on the bag the paper is slipped into.  Is this normal; should I assume significant loss of potency?  Sheets are dosed at 1000ug.  Half dozen sheets collecting dust I picked up to make a quick move but the kid changed his number the day it came in.  Tempted to roll up somewhere and play the mad doser but I'm paranoid some kid will have a seizure or some shit.

I can't say exactly what the 'complexing' is, but it modifies the 25i a little so it's absorbed easier (and making it water soluble, I believe). As a result, complexed tabs should be stronger than 'regular' 25i, therefore the lower recommended dose.

And while I haven't got a lot of experience with using supplements to counteract vasoconstriction, I'd suggest looking into supplements that boost NO-production. I know bodybuilders use them to increase bloodflow to their muscles, improving results. Should help with 25i as well, but again I don't have personal experience.


Yesterday I finally tripped 'for real' on 25i. Had taken ~350ug and ~650ug before (I have 1mg complexed tabs) and wasn't really impressed to be honest. Going for the full 1mg however (and perhaps having taken a little longer psychedelic break than before), I experienced how powerful this substance can be. I'm not a very visual tripper usually, but on the peak this got pretty intense. Easily comparable to a high dose of 2C-E, although it felt a lot more chaotic (but less mindfuck-ish). I can imagine the horror if someone would have sold me these tabs as LSD and I'd have taken 3 or 4 of them. 1mg certainly was strong enough and I don't have any desire to go higher.

To be honest, I'm not even sure if I want to continue using 25i. It just feels a little weird and unsafe, although that's partially just placebo of course. But until there's some more research done on the dangers of this stuff, I know I'm going to stay very careful.

So I'm planning on tripping on two 1mg blotters of what I believe to be as 25I nbome tonight possiblyyyyy, though the big question here is that my last trip was on the 4th, and I would be taking it now on the 10th/11th (as it is now 12:08 AM where I live now). I have never dosed at 2mg before and my last trip was within the range ~2weeks-tolerance. Would I still have a good trip upping it to 2mg although it would be within the tolerance range? I definitely feel I can handle it, and from my previous experiences with 25I every time I have tried it with a 1mg blotter whether it be spaced a week or a couple days even I still had an amazing trip. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Someone get back to me on this soon!

Sincerely, The Don

@ the don;

expect to be very tolerance free (by 2 weeks even 1 week should be very free of tolerance), be good about set and setting

Aye Aye Captain, will be ready for lift off either tonight or Monday as my housemates seem to be at the house this weekend. Decided against tripping last night considering the possibility of my tolerance being an issue. Thanks for the reply @pupnik

(I'll be sure to put a good trip report up from this next trip I have)

if there was ever a drug that felt like it took a chunk out of my brain its this one. Be REALLY FUCKING careful because all of the full agonist psychedelics are probably a lot more damaging in cases of OD. 


also it causes a tolerance that builds really fast and prevents you from seeing the beautiful visuals that actually good psychedelics like LSD will provide.


take mushrooms instead. Seriously, this warning is basically the reason I made my BL account a few years ago.

How many different nbomes are there? 

I know there is:

25I

25C

25B

25D


but are there others?

and does anyone here know how good any of them are?

I'm very interested in trying each.

A list would be helpful as well as a rating/description of each.

Thanks.


Sincerely, 

The Don

I fell in love with the nbomes as soon as I tried them...especially 25i. At first I would complex my sheets but have discovered there is no real noticeable difference as long as potent alcohol is used to dissolve. Even uncomplexed , 600ug is enough for me, I tend to only take it once in a blue moon though.


But as far as people saying its shallow... I have had some of the most profound experiences with this substance, mindblowing visuals w any dose above 900ug(cev and oev) ...awesome headspace and minimal body load. I honestly think that some people dont fully understand how to take it , maybe swallowing too much spit? I guess maybe 3.5 yrs of suboxone maintenence has helped me maximize efficiancy?  Ive also only tried insuffalating (sp?) it once, and I much prefer sl/buccal. 

Anyways, as long as its done right and in moderation, it is one of my favorite chems thusfar...and I have had quite a few lol

I am training myself to call it 25i instead of  nbomb though it totally tastes bomb which may not be bad, not quite elegant.

but the effect is elegant. and a bit of nasty taste is not a bad payment for the right to get shifted into psychedelicstan.


If I were denied access to lsd, this would suffice - visually and emotionally, I even prefer the rapid ramp to full effects in less than an hour versus the slow ramp on lsz or lsd (which are excellent in their own rights). I just did not expect to find that I like this so well, given the choice of 25i and lsz tonight was an instant nobrainer - go 25i (fast ramp, actually taste it, will be settled by midnight).


I was just watching the ceiling with thousands of neon animations (like emily carr totem pole faces and animals or just geometries in neon color)


then thinking of people I saw them far away in hi resolution, and their crazy thoughts were amazing to imagine. all as OEV on the ceiling we did lights out early.


I am  dosing 1/2 blotters that are sold as 1000mics. and I get consistent results if I have 2 days off between.

Not everyone is the same and clearly 25I just does not agree with some people.  I think personal health has a lot ALOT to do with good and bad experiences, but that is just my opinion.  I only experienced vascoconstriction one time,  and it was mildly bothersome,  add more magnesium to my diet before and after  and well  just in general now helped that a lot and pretty much eliminated that negative all togeather....  mild cold feet effect. 


I have only ever done .5 mg,  and 1 mg doses sublingually, 1mg being my sweetspot for a sublingual experience.  I have felt effects at .25  to .3  snorted mild  similar to .5mg  sublingual.  I have also used .2 nasal drops as mild reboots, but I maintain the only way to do this is to start with the powder and KNOW exactly what you have infront of you.


I think most of us agree this has the same danger level as true MDMA  for the majority of us,  however the dose level is minute compared to MDMA so there is far less room for error.

The only time I ever experienced a real vasoconstrictive effect (hands and feet changed color and were cold to the touch) was when I took 25I and 25C at the same time. Taking either one alone I was fine and had very little body load other than some muscle tension, which magnesium can also take care of.

today I am mixing 1/4 tab of 25i with 1/4 tab of LSZ - going for my sweetspot total of 1/2 tab but of a mix

and I have to say they do mix well.

euphoric, 

a bit fluttery

nice.

After my previous 2 unimpressive results with 25-I; I've been given another couple of tabs.

The first time I took it; I halved the tab and took each half within an hour or 2 of each other and got nothing.

The second time I took it I took 1 tab and get very mild effects.


This will be the third time I've been given it and this time I've 2 tabs to play with. Due to the seemingly unpredictable nature of this stuff I'll be taking 1 tab and then halving the 2nd to top up if need be.

Will report back.

Might hit harder but apparently it's a lot more dangerous. I think a lot of the deaths attributed to NBOMes are either caused by taking too many (usually via mismarketing them as acid) or by insufflation.

Tolerance builds very quickly with this one, so a redose might not necessarily be a waste but it might not be as effective as if you were to ingest it initially.

Hey everyone!


Maybe it's not the good section for my question, - in that case please point me to the right thread - my Good Ol' Dog just acquired 50mg 25I-NBOMe Hcl and he intends to store it in liquid form. He's planning to put the 50mg's into 50ml of 40% vodka (some say distilled water is enough but need a glass container anyway, and maybe the alcohol masks the substance's taste a little bit). The goal is to achieve a 1mg/1ml solution. Unfortunately he has no former experiences in mixing powders with liquids and he's completely new to this substance, so he doesn't know if his "measurements" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) are accurate. He also noticed that some people putting HPBCD into their mixes. Is it required for the freebase form only or is it mandatory?


I think that's all for now. If you have any remarks, or suggestions for a newcomer please feel free to do so.


Thanks in advance!

Moved this:


Yesterday i had a pretty 'profound' trip on just 200ug. It was actually very interesting and it contrasted many of my higher dosage trips, which seemed entirely physical and visual. This drug is really strange and it seems like i get more emotional, intuitive and moral associated psychedelic effects with the lower dosages.


My 200ug trip today compared to my last 2000ug trip was night and day. Today was more reminiscent of low dose LSD than i would have ever thought possible, whereas on 2mg the intense rushy, gushy jell-o land with a ton of bursting visuals and aurals and creepy and tingly bodily sensations really pull me away from 25i's spiritual side. I think i'm just gonna use this chem at very low dosages form now on. I really seem to prefer them.


So for me after using it roughly 20 times i feel like i'm just starting to understand it, but of course ... then again . . .

I don't know about your question specifically, but just wanted to let you know that it is not orally active.  So, you'd need to hold the solution in your mouth for maybe 15 minutes or so to make it work, if you swallow it right off, it will have no effect.

Insufflation liquid? I've never heard of this, seems counterintuitive.

I believe the NBOMe series are all fairly stable, even in solution. Using HPBCD has been found to be not really necessary to improve buccal absorption. Also, 50 mg in 50 mL is 1 mg/mL but make sure to watch out for evaporation which could offset your dosage drastically. I would recommend measuring the volume of liquid you have beforehand each time you dose to ensure it remains at what you left it. If you find some has evaporated, simply replace the missing amount with an equal amount of vodka.

Also, you can insufflate liquids (many medications come in the form of nasal sprays) but dosing the NBOMe series nasally has proven to be much more problematic than sublingual or buccal. It's much easier to overdose or freak out because the onset is much more rapid and the bioavailability is greater.

I have been enjoying etizolam with 25inbome - half blotter of each - lovely.

Tread carefully with NBOMe chemicals. There are multiple reports of idiosyncratic reactions. It can be fatal in susceptible individuals.


I have two theories about these idiosyncratic reactions. 

1) An individual might suffer from transient hepatic impairment. Evidence suggests 25X NBOMe chemicals are broken down hepaticly.* If taken during a sweet spot of hepatic impairment duration and bioavailability might increase. 

2) An individual might consume an NBOMe during a period of anxiety. This could result in lower doses of 25x NBOMe required to end up out of it.


These two scenarios could happen concurrently. Every person has slightly different combinations of problems so predicting susceptibility is challenging. Could either of these scenarios explain your spontaneous hypersensitivity?

Short report: I had the most painful experience of my life about 4 hours in on this drug. It felt as though every vein and nerve in my body wanted to escape; sharp and unforgiving pain that would not quit. First, I tried to convince myself I was simply having my first bad trip and I could psyche myself out of it but that did not work. I kept as calm as I could and after what felt like 10-20 minutes of feeling like I was going to die, I chewed up some klonopin and had a friend massage me until I fell asleep.


I slept from 2:30pm to 8:30pm and awoke with a headache, slight tingle still in my body and a type of disorientation I never experienced before but I can almost relate it to an oxycodone high. 


Sadly I do not know how much was on the blotter but I can tell you, I was having time distortion, looping, euphoria, hallucinations and profound realizations from about hour 3 to when the pain started. The first 2 hours was light visuals, tingling and bouts of giggles.


I will write a more detailed and entertaining review once I fully recover. (This experience happened 2 days ago and I am still feeling states of extreme fatigue and confusion.)

My second ever psychedelic experience was on n-bomb, taken on the 22nd of April, the day before my birthday. I took 4mg (my first time also being with n-bomb on 1mg 2-3 weeks prior) and had a terrible, terrifying experience. Genuinely believed I was dying. Would not recommend it to anyone. It was incredibly intense though.

Sorry you had a bad experience, but why did you take four times as much as your first time? If you went out to a bar and had 3 beers, do you think it'd be a good idea a week later to go out and drink 12 beers?

Not to say I haven't enjoyed some of the more intense 25i trips I've had. As Shulgin once said, it's like an "archetypal psychedelic stim" or whatever. BUT! I truly feel bummed out for the local hippies/psyche dealers (this affects me, greatly considering these are my plugs) passing off this 25i digital shit as LSD. 25i being passed off to somebody as LSD is shameful and disrespectful to psychedelics and the spiritual world, in which psychonauts should look out for each other. 


Some take so many different compounds with their 4-6 tabs of 25i + (MDA, DMT, s-ket, shroomz or whatever, maybe some wonderful 4-aco-dmt) that they truly can't tell. 25i lacks any spirituality IMHE, and I think it's because (unlike LSD, psilo, ect.) it's a full-agonist at the 5-HT receptors. That's the only prominent contrast when held up to classic psychedelics. These hippies are dumb as fuck or they know and just need to make their money back to re-up on *real* LSD 


**I've heard 25d-NBOMe had some significant spirituality? Anybody have a say on 25d?** My bad for straying away from 25i only, I just want to find some spiritual about 25x's, not just trips.

spiritual, you mean with redeeming resonant insights?

careful what you call not spiritual


the ergoloids and tryptomines with much less body load may seem more "spiritual" but these nbox are just as real and resonant in their own way.

( like them a lot, though I feel they are cheap and dirty in some way too - but that does not make them "un-spiritual" )


personally I keep hoping I buy a shit load of lsz and throw away all my nbox stash, but I know I will never buy enough lsz so  I wont throw my stash because I actually still like it. nobody else I know likes it however, so I trip alone. Of course that way it lasts much longer.

Please note that all the information you will read here is based off of SWIM's first-hand experiences with the drug "25i-NBOMe". Swim has used 25i approximately 30 to 35 times. **(mod note: The opinion expressed here is merely that of 'snikrepj' and should NOT be taken as fact)**


**Some experiences.**

Note - You do gain a tolerance to 25i-NBOMe, all of these experiences have been documented two weeks or more after not taking the drug, as that is how long it takes for your tolerance to the drug to completely be gone.


1 Tab - 

Swim has taken 1 tab many times and does not find it very satisfying. After doing 1 tab about 3 times Swim noticed that visuals were lazy(Things crawled at best.), and the body highwas not as intense and music not as enjoyable.


2 Tabs -

Swim used to take 2 tabs very often, and has done it an estimated 10 times. Visuals are good, and the body high is good and music is great.


3 Tabs - 

Swim loves to take 3 hits, and has at least 10 times. Visuals are near perfect and the body high sensational, and music godlike.


4 Tabs -

Swim thinks this could either be really good and a bit scary or just really good. Swim does not recommend taking 4 tabs unless you are an experienced psychedelic user. 


5 Tabs - 

Swim has done this one time, and slipped into the void. After the void this was the most visuals Swim has ever seen on the drug, and the craziest body high he has had.


**Rolling on 25i, is it possible? Is it Safe?

**Yes, you can "roll" on 25i, however it will make the high, head-space, and the visuals go way down and increase your tolerance tremendously.

Swim has rolled on 25i, he took 10 hits in one night. It didn't increase the high at all, it would pick it back up if it disappeared though. Swim does not recommend rolling on 25i, it's a waste and dangerous.


**​Marijuana on 25i?

**Swim has smoked marijuana every time he has taken 25i. It is safe, and enhances the drug.


**

Is 25i safe to take a lot?

**Swim wouldn't recommend it.


**What are the visuals like?

**Swim usually sees, things that turn into shapes and come at his face( on a good trip ), but usually Swim sees many geometrical shapes on 25i and things that moves nicely.


**Is 25i worth trying?

**Yes.


**mod edit: the following was removed, the complaint being that there is no evidence to back this up:**


**NSFW**: 


**Is 25i safe to take once?

**Yes 25i is safe to take once, you will not die assuming that it is actually 25i.

25I isn't safe to take once. I read someone on this forum talking about how it can cause death in users, even at doses lower than they are used to - the mechanism behind theses deaths are so far unknown. I've stopped taking NBOMes since this. I'm not 100% sure on it though, but that's what I read from a user who usually seems extremely knowledgeable.


Also, don't use SWIM on this forum. It doesn't help you. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

When it comes to drugs, opinions don't matter. Facts do. This is important to remember, especially on a harm reduction forum.

How you yourself react to these drugs says nothing about how some other poor fellow might react, at this point it is not really clear if incidents are predictable. It's not even clear if there are just some people that don't happen to tolerate the (side)effects well.


Thanks for your help but let's not make premature assumptions about the safety of compounds like these.


Also a 'tab' is not a measure of a drug dose and it does not allow other people to make comparisons or tell what 'proper' use is.


You mention a crazy body high when taking a high dose. It may also very well be that some of the euphoric drug effects make you less sensitive to the worrisome sensation of vasoconstriction and other similar side-effects. I can't say I am very reassured of the 'safety' by reading this.


Why is rolling on 25I dangerous but is it safe without the ecstasy?...


I don't think it is in the spirit of Harm Reduction for you to tell others that they will not die from trying it once. You cannot possibly know that, and we have tragic accounts of accidents that may be suggesting that it does not take repeated use or high doses for someone to get a life-threatening reaction.

3 days ago i took 2 blotters of 25i-nBOME after being told that if i was looking for something stronger than usual, these are the next level thing going around melbourne at the moment!

I'd like to share my experience.

185cm, 70kg and very experienced recreational/educational drug taker

i kept notes as i was tripping and time stamps on everything.  The entire trip lasted about 12/13 hours with not having consumed any other substances beforehand.

IMO, this felt very little like LSD, more like DMT or a mushy trip.


I kept the blotter on my upper gum for 30 minutes without moving it around and after 40 minutes i swallowed it.

There was a very very strong bitter taste in my mouth and after about 90 minutes, i started feeling a subtle change in my surroundings, and i could feel spiritual energy inside of me start building.

This is when i made the big decision to do another one.  After the first 5 minutes of having the 2nd blotter on my gum, i started getting VERY intense visuals, both open and close eye.  Everything was beautiful, my walls were melting, i could see intense geometrical shapes morphing into another, i could feel the spiritual energy in the room, i could see every particle of energy in the room, i felt i could control my trip very greatly so i started playing with it, colours were intensified, faces on the tv were morphing into crazy alien like figurines.

+1hr from taking 2nd blotter - by this stage i felt very out-of-this-planet, it felt like i was in a DMT trip, everything was colourful, intense greens, blues, violet, yellow, orange - amazing.  i was in absolute awe of how beautiful the world was & still is... i dug deep inside my inner self, really feeling this incredible drug.  The trip is getting so intense i feel nauseous, a little paranoia setting in but music was amazing, bass making my trip explode into all things amazing.  Listening to music is giving me a sense of completion.

+1.2hrs:  i decide i might mix with a little marijuana, as i read up that mixing 25i with weed can increase the intensity of the trip... That was an incredible idea.  Pupils are fully dilated, no colour whatsoever that i can see.  I'm in more awe of the sights, shapes, colours, things i'm hearing, the weed has gotten rid of the little paranoia and increased the buzz from it.  Feeling a lot MDMAish, heart is pounding irregularly, emotionally happy, on cloud 9 - nothing really bad so far.

+2.5hrs: trip is still really intense.  Can't keep still, eyes keep trying to take everything in.  i feel i can't leave my bed because the floor has turned into geometrical shapes falling into a deep nothingness.  i pluck the courage to jump off my bed and lay on the floor.  WOW best idea ever!  i don't know where i am.  i'm motionless on the floor.  I feel a massive smile come across my face but i can't feel my body.  it's gone!  I suddenly feel something pass through me and i feel like i'm floating around my house and when i close my eyes i'm in someone else's body.  

+3.5hrs:  i haven't moved from the floor, listening to psy-trance has taken me from earth and into space - somewhere very far away.  colours are still intense, everything is beautiful, life as i know it has just gotten better!

+7hrs:  i can't believe i'm still tripping hardcore.  i'm starting to wonder when this will stop being so intense as the sun is about to rise.  starting to really feel the decrease of serotonin and the strain on my eyes now, massive headache starting to come so i decide to have a joint.  the headache goes after that.

+10hrs:  not tripping much at all now, still full of energy, much like i've had MDMA.  

+12hrs:  feeling like i need to sleep so i pop a benzo and i sleep for 23 hours, waking up refreshed and enlightened by my experience taking 2 blotters of 25i-nBOME

As far as it's currently know it's not a releaser at all. Full agonist for 5ht2a, partial for a few others.

Yeah, i meant ml of Ethanol. Im fairly sure it was 98% denatured EtOH, it evaporated without residue. You could probably use Isopropanol as well.

Sorry if this question has already been answered, but I want to confirm it:


Is it possible to blend 100 miligrams of 25Inbome in 500 drops of vodka, and then add one drop to a small piece of kitchen paper, and put the paper between my cheek and upper gum, therefore consuming 200 micrograms?

The math is right, but a single drop is not a reliable way to measure out fluids (and this is not a substance you want to mess up the dosing with). There is a lot of variance in the sizes of drops that come out of a medicine dropper and you could also accidentally put two or three drops on the paper by mistake. It's a better idea to have a more dilute solution that can be measured with an oral syringe, for example I usually do 1mg/mL. Of course this requires a bit more planning beforehand because you need to have some time to let the paper dry. You could also try just swallowing your dose, as some of us here have discovered recently that that works just fine (even though theoretically NBOMes should not be orally active).

- You can, but it is not the best idea gives you very very little room for error.  SO I agree with ZN, go for a higher liquid to material ratio.  A better place to start with less chance for error would be the 1ml to 1mg ratio or the most I would go to for a starter would be  5 ml to 10 mg. 


and make sure your 10 mg, is really 10 mg, not this a sample of 10 mg in a baggy and you just trust that as gospel.  Unless you have a scale you don't know if you have 10 mg,  15mg  or even 20 mg of Powder

Thx a lot for the answer!


So then, I can mix 100 mg in 100 ml of vodka, so that 0.2 ml equals 0.2 milligrams, which is a low dose. If I wanted to have a medium/strong trip I could pour half a ml in a bit of kitchen paper, wait for it to dry, and then put the paper between my gums... or swallowed it? Is that confirmed? I've never tried this type of drug, but I have been reading, from the very beginning, how it is not active orally... is there a consensus on this, or shall I stick to the gums route?

Yeah, I know, I've been using NBOMes for 2 and a half years now and everyone was saying back then that they don't work orally. I guess there were a few early reports saying so, and there was some theoretical justification for it so it became accepted wisdom. I was quite surprised a few months ago when I finally got around to trying an oral dose and it was almost as effective as the buccal doses I had been doing: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads...old-as-LSD?p=12394716&viewfull=1#post12394716](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/724566-Important-NBOMe-warning-Taking-unknown-blotters-sold-as-LSD?p=12394716&viewfull=1#post12394716)


There are lots of weird myths surrounding these chemicals anyway, such as the whole "complexing" thing (completely unnecessary, in my experience).


The main differences between oral and sublingual/buccal dosing are that it takes about twice as long to come up (about an hour for oral vs. 1/2 hour for sublingual), and there is more gut activity and some slight nausea for oral (though still not as bad as a lot of other psychs). On the other hand, the advantage of oral is that you don't have that nasty bitter taste hanging around in your mouth for the whole trip. Though if you put the blotter on your upper gum, and then sip on a glass of milk or chocolate milk afterwards, it's not too bad.


Some people have reported that swallowing blotters didn't work for them, so if you want to be absolutely sure then you can put the paper between your gums like you were originally planning, that'll definitely work. You'll want to leave it there for about a half hour, then you can throw it out. I never swallowed them because I didn't want to get the chemical taste all over the back of my throat. I think 200ug is a very low dose for 25I, and you might not even feel it; I would actually go with 500-600ug for a first time.


Good luck :D ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Sorry if this has been asked elsewhere but I couldn't find anything conclusive with the search.  Has anybody combined 25i and mephedrone, and if so were there any adverse effects.  Also, if anyone knows of any pharmocological reason that these two should not be mixed then that would be incredibly helpful.


The main issues that I can think of would be increased vasoconstriction and blood pressure.  However, these aren't too alarming for me as I have no intention of stacking the peaks of the two drugs.  Rather I plan to take some mephedrone during the day tomorrow and I am also contemplating a psytrace event in the evening, which I would take the 25i for.  I would intend to leave at least a couple of hours between the meph wearing off and dosing the 25i.  However, if this sounds like a considerable risk then do speak up! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also, what would be a good dose for a social/recreational oriented experience? The blotters I have are 1.2mg but from reading some reports, this sounds like it might be a fairly psychedelic dose.  I would prefer to remain at least somewhat functional while tripping in public!

I don't see how it would be a problem if you're planning on leaving hours between the mephedrone wearing off and dosing, but then again, that's just me using "common sense" which means nothing.


1.2mg is definitely going to be too much for a social setting. It depends on what exactly the function is, but I would do half, if not less than half, if you're going to be in a setting where you're surrounded by people that are not ok with that type of thing.

I have some interesting observations about tolerance that I hope would be useful.

Doses were from reliable vendor.


Day 1: 1mg taken at 11pm (3 hours after 150ug AL-LAD dose)

Amazing visuals and some insight on the comedown, one of the best psychadelic experiences I've had. Lasted around 7 hours.


Day 2: 1mg taken at 3pm

Hardly some, if not any, visuals. Perhaps it seemed like the world had higher contrast (e.g greener grass, bluer sky). Weed didn't add anything to the experience.


Day 5: 2.5mg taken at midnight

Some visuals, as if I've taken less than 400ug. Whole experience lasted around 4 hours.


So in conclusion, if you're planning on tripping with 25i again, do wait a MINIMUM of 1 week, optimally 2 weeks, if you want the most out of your trip.

I hope this was useful to some people

I never thought I could dislike a psychedelic until I came across 25I. Thanks to this chemical I now know what is meant by the term 'body load'.

I've had DOM, 2C-E, DPT, LSD, 4-AcO-DMT and shrooms and I get along just fine with them. I'm a pretty hardcore psychonaut - tonight's DOM trip is going to be my 7th since the start of the year (and we're not even half-way through January... shit!).


25I is the most dirty feeling, anxiogenic, dysphoric shit I've ever taken. I was shocked. Seriously, what's the point in this stuff? I took it twice and had to take codeine+promethazine just to quell the body load and make the experience bearable; then smoke and drink myself into a stupor to be able to enjoy it.


Seriously, just stay away from 25I. There is something very fucked up and sinister about this chemical, plus it's very toxic.

Both times I had a blotter with 1-1.5mg.

I would like to add that I'm healthy and athletic. I eat well, I take magnesium citrate and a couple of other supplements every day and go to the gym/play sports 3-4 times per week.


The  body load was fucking horrendous the first time I did it. Not painful  or nauseating - just extremely uncomfortable and disgusting. I was  getting a lot of weird sensations mostly in my bladder and my asshole (NOT COOL)  and shaking like I had Parkinson's or some shit.

The second time I already had the codeine+promethazine in me before I dosed, so I managed to avoid the body load. I still had to smoke myself retarded to combat the anxiety though.


Trust me,  I can handle my psychedelics. I  barely get any body load from 2C-E, LSD or DPT - even in high doses.  DOM (which I'm tripping on now) and 4-AcO-DMT don't give me a body load at all. All of these  psychedelics give me a very warm, euphoric body high which for some  reason was totally absent from both my 25I experiences. And before you say it, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with  set and setting. It's a crappy compound, plain and simple.


The NBOMes are a profoundly useless class of drugs. There is nothing special about them at all - they don't do anything that other phenethylamines and LSD etc. don't do better. Plus there's the toxicity - this shit has been known to cause nerve damage and even painful deaths in some people for no discernable reason. Seriously, fuck NBOMes.

I pretty much feel the same way, and get the same exact reaction from NBOMEs. Just a very unpleasant drug all around, almost like it wasn't even intended for human consumption. It seems more poisonous than psychedelic.

While I agree with your opinion you took a very large dose. Erowid lists 500-800mcg as common. And not knowing exactly how much between 1 and 1,5mg does not help either.

Dear all,


I'd like to express my experience and concern with this compound and it's possible physical harm n toxicity.


A bit of background on myself:

Late  20s, plenty of experiences with psychedelics mostly LSD, some shroom  trips thrown in there, one time had a 2c-P trip (most bizarre visual  experience!). Taken MDMA a plethora of times. Kilos of cannabis probably  smoked.

Out of all the psychedelic doses I've had, I've never felt  any lingering physical harm post the trip/experience, in general I felt  quite healthy after I've come down and a few days later.


This  summer (2015), I received some blotter paper that was sold to me as LSD,  I took one and instantly noticed how bitter it was. I thought it was  strange as I never had such bitter acid before, after searching online I  found this new compound which has been reported to be LSD, but actually  was 25i-Nbome. Anyway the trip was lovely and quite mild. Over the  course of the next couple of months I intermittently took it more,  mostly in half doses and noticed if I wasn't particular active during  the experience, there would be an uncomfortable heart/chest sensation,  It didn't worry me too much as when taking MDMA, also gave this side  effect, which wouldn't feel no more intense than an 30 min jog. Heart  rate increases, so in a party sense this would be quite acceptable, take  25i, get a boost of energy, heart rate increases, you come down, heart  rate goes back to normal. Safe and no harm done, good time had.


Some  months later, again being sold something to be LSD but after taking it,  clearly not! as it was extremely bitter. This batch was stronger than  before. First time I took it was a half blotter at a festival, It was  strong, good times and no sleep was had. After a few days there was no  lingering physical harm perceived. 


Now, Around 3/4 weeks ago, I  took 1 full tab of this newer batch as tolerance was thought to have  developed. Well It wasn't! I experienced mad fractal visions accompanied  with a highly increased heart rate, there was some heavy anxiety at  times too. It took some time to come down the next day and go to sleep.  However my concern is I think this compound **fucked with my heart **or  something because some of the chest sensations that were felt during  the trip are still felt now although not as intense, even 3/4 weeks  after!! I never had this with any other psychedelics, so it is very  disconcerting, what kind of long-term effects this compound has on our  nuero-chemistry that regulates blood flow to the heart etc... etc.... I  urge people to avoid this compound and if you must take it, take it a  very low doses.


FYI: I am not entirely sure it is 25i-Nbome by  the way, I can only assume it is from the taste and online trip reports  discussing the effects, it could be any of the Nbome 2C type compounds  or something else, but it was on blotter. 


Be safe everyone ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif).

I received a nasal spray from a friend at 140ug/s. He also gave me 2C-B-FLY-NBOMe, which I most likely will never use.


I am very excited to try 25i, as i've always wanted to try 2C-I but never got a hold of it. My friend actually nicknamed 25i "beautyspray". But on the other hand i'm fairly scared of the side effects. I've had 25e-NBOH in a nasal spray solution, worked my way up to 800ug and had intense visuals which were dope. But after that came EXTREME vasoconstriction which had me panicking very hard. I've managed every psychedelic on my own including tons of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT trips but with this vasoconstriction I just couldn't get ahold of my mind, I thought I was dying. I hope this will not be the case with 25i..

> I am very excited to try 25i, as i've always wanted to try 2C-I but never got a hold of it. My friend actually nicknamed 25i "beautyspray". But on the other hand i'm fairly scared of the side effects. I've had 25e-NBOH in a nasal spray solution, worked my way up to 800ug and had intense visuals which were dope. But after that came EXTREME vasoconstriction which had me panicking very hard. I've managed every psychedelic on my own including tons of DMT and 5-MeO-DMT trips but with this vasoconstriction I just couldn't get ahold of my mind, I thought I was dying. I hope this will not be the case with 25i..

25i is the most dangerous nbome. Especially intranasal. Keep the dosage low, if you do use this. And know that it is much different than 2C-I.

This drug gave me the worst vasoconstriction of anything I've ever tried, by far...

What do you consider low?

Lower than 750ug. Ideally 500ug or lower.


You're still playing with fire, though.


My recommendation is to ditch it.

Isn't the poison in the dose? I thought all deaths were paired with extremely high dosages (or thinking they had LSD so doubled/trippled dosages)?

Some deaths occurred as low as 1000ug. Generally, you're correct. And, the nBOMEs are fickle substances whose lethality is not well understood. Hence, playing with fire.
