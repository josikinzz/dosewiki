DURATION #
 
Caution : Reactions and experiences may vary dramatically from person to person. [ see below ]
 
EFFECTS LIST #
 
POSITIVE
 
- increase in energy (stimulation) minor visuals
 
NEUTRAL
 
- general change in consciousness (as with most psychoactives) pupil dilation erratic eye movements
 
NEGATIVE
 
- muscle spasms increased blood temperature increased blood pressure increased body temperature (fever) increased pulse rate labored breathing nausea & vomiting convulsions, coma & death (see reports in [media](https://erowid.org/pma_media.shtml) and [journal](https://erowid.org/pma_journal.shtml) sections)
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
PMA has been used as a recreational psychoactive (primarily in the 70s), at doses around 50 mg. Unfortunately, more often it has been sold as MDA or MDMA (ecstasy). The dosages for MDMA (80-160 mg) are significantly higher than those of PMA. At 60-80 mg, PMA can become extremely dangerous, causing increased blood temperature and blood pressure. In recent cases, PMA has been sold as ecstasy, in pressed pill form indistinguishable from ecstasy and at unknown dosages.

PMA Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
Pure PMA is a white powder, but forms found on the street can also be somewhat beige, pink, or yellowish. Recently is has been found most frequently in pressed pill form sold as MDMA (ecstasy). There is very little available information about safe recreational dosages for PMA. Doses as low as 60 mg can cause significant and alarming increase in blood pressure, body temperature and pulse. The most concerning aspect of this is that if PMA is sold as ecstasy, some people will take multiple pills, increasing chances of a PMA overdose significantly.

**PMA Health** 
 **by Erowid** 
**WARNINGS** : 
 
- **PMA, though quite rare, is occasionally sold as MDA or MDMA on the street.** 
 There were a number of cases in the mid 70's where PMA was sold as MDA, leading to several deaths and it appears that something similar may now be happening in various parts of the world. [Reports from Chicago](https://erowid.org/references/media/2000_chicago_1.shtml) (May 2000) have suggested that 2 recent deaths attributed to MDMA may have been cases of PMA sold as Ecstasy. Similarly, Australia seems to have had [several cases of PMA deaths](https://erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=18) over the past few years. 
 
 **PMA is more dangerous than MDMA.** 
 At dosages from 60-80 mg (lower than those used regularly for Ecstasy), it can cause a sudden, large, and potentially fatal rise in blood temperature, body temperature and blood pressure. One of the recently reported deaths came after a young woman ingested 3 pills, not uncommon with ecstasy, but potentially deadly with PMA.

*PiHKAL Entry #97*


## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 32 g LAH in 1 L anhydrous Et2O was well stirred and 32.6 g 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in Et2O was added at a rate that maintained a reflux. After the addition was complete, reflux was continued for 48 h. The reaction mixture was cooled, and the excess hydride was destroyed by the cautious addition of dilute H2SO4. The Et2O was separated, and extracted with additional aqueous H2SO4. A solution of 700 g potassium sodium tartrate in 600 mL H2O was added, and the pH brought to >9 with 25% NaOH. This aqueous phase was extracted with 3Ã200 mL CH2Cl2 which provided, after removal of the solvent, 32.5 g of a clear amber oil. This was dissolved in 100 mL IPA, neutralized with concentrated HCl, and then diluted with 300 mL anhydrous Et2O. There was obtained white crystals of 4-methoxyamphetamine hydrochloride (4-MA) that weighed, after filtering, Et2O washing and air drying, 22.2 g and had a mp of 208â209 Â°C. The amphetamine metabolite, 4-hydroxyamphetamine hydrochloride (4-HA), was prepared by heating 5.0 g 4-MA in 20 mL concentrated HCl at 15 lbs/in. After recrystallization from aqueous EtOH, the product weighed 3.8 g and had a mp of 171â172 Â°C.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 70 mg) âIt hit quite suddenly. I had a feeling of druggedness, almost an alcohol-like intoxication, and I never was really high in the psychedelic sense.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Two comments are warranted concerning 4-MA, one of scientific interest, and the other about a social tragedy.

A major metabolites of amphetamine is 4-hydroxyamphetamine, from oxidation at the 4-position. It has been long known that with chronic amphetamine usage there is the generation of tolerance, which encourages ever-increasing doses to be used. When the daily load gets up around one or two hundred milligrams, the subject can become quite psychotic. The question was asked: might the chronic amphetamine user be methylating his endogenously produced 4-hydroxyamphetamine to produce 4-methoxyamphetamine (4-MA), and maybe this is the agent that promotes the psychosis? To address this question, several studies were done with normal subjects, about 20 years ago, to see if 4-MA might produce a psychotic state (it didnât at the highest levels tried, 75 milligrams) and to see if it was excreted to some extent unchanged in the urines of these normal subjects (it was seen even at the lowest dosage tried, 10 milligrams). It produced excitation and other central effects, it produced adrenergic pressor effects, and it consistently produced measurable quantities of 4-MA in the urine, but it produced no amphetamine-like crazies. And since the administration of up to 600 milligrams of amphetamine produced no detectable 4-MA in the urine, this theory of psychotomimesis is not valid.

On the tragic side, a few years later, 4-MA became widely distributed in both the US (as the sulfate salt) and in Canada (as the hydrochloride), perhaps inspired by some studies in rats that had reported that it was second only to LSD in potency as a hallucinogen. The several deaths that occurred probably followed overdose, and it was clear that 4-MA was involved as it had been isolated from both urine and tissue during post mortems. It had been sold under the names of Chicken Power and Chicken Yellow, and was promoted as being MDA. I could find no record of a typical street dosage, but comments collected in association with the deaths implied that the ingested quantites were in the hundreds of milligrams. Recently, the ethoxy homologue, 4-EA, appeared on the streets of Canada. The dosage, again, was not reported. It was promptly illegalized there.

The two positional analogues of 4-MA are known; vis., 2-MA and 3-MA. Their synthesis is straightforward, in imitation of that for 4-MA above. The meta-compound, 3-MA, has been metabolically explored in man, but no central effects were noted at a 50 milligram dose (2Ã25 milligrams, separated by three hours). There appears to be no report of any human trial of 2-MA. The N-methyl homologue of 2-MA is a commercial adrenergic bronchodilator called Methoxyphenamine, or Orthoxine. It has been used in the prevention of acute asthma attacks in doses of up to 200 milligrams, with only slight central stimulation. The N-methyl homologues of  3-MA and  4-MA are known, and the latter compound is the stuff of a separate entry in this book.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: < 10 mg
- Light: 20 - 40 mg
- Common: 40 - 60 mg
- Strong: Higher dosages can result in serious hyperthermia and eventually death.

**Duration:**
- Total: short
**PMA can cause life-threatening side effects (such as [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) and [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) ) even at moderate doses.**
 
As a result, using this substance is strongly discouraged. It is also advised to always test your [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) for the presence of PMA using a [reagent testing kit](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reagent_testing_kit) as it is a common adulterant. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMA#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
***para* -Methoxyamphetamine** (also known as **4-methoxyamphetamine** , **4-MeOA** , inaccurately as **4-MA** (which should be reserved for [4-MA](/w/index.php?title=4-MA&action=edit&redlink=1) (4-MeA) instead) and more commonly as **PMA** ) is a potent [hallucinogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. PMA belongs to a family of substances known as the [substituted amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamines) . However, unlike other substituted amphetamines, PMA does not produce [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) or [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects, nor [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It is not taken on its own but is instead found as an ingredient in tablets of "Ecstasy" as a false substitute for [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .

PMA has been around since the 1970s, where it was sold along with [PMMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA) as Ecstasy, and has gained great attention following a number of hospitalizations and deaths. It usually does not produce much noticeable effects, which leads people ingesting more or combining it with other substances, until they eventually overdose. It produces dangerous adverse effects, including a sudden and extremely high rise in body temperature and blood pressure, abnormal heartbeats, dehydration and sometimes severe dizziness.

**PMA, along with other drugs like [PMMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA) and [PMEA](/w/index.php?title=PMEA&action=edit&redlink=1) have very little recreational value and are considered as one of the most dangerous and toxic substances known. It is strongly recommended that these two drugs should be completely avoided.**

## Chemistry

PMA (para-Methoxyamphetamine or 4-MA) is a molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . It contains a methoxy (OCH 3 ) functional group bound to the R 4 carbon of the phenyl ring. It is the 4-Methoxy analog of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .

## Pharmacology

PMA acts as a [selective serotonin releasing agent](/w/index.php?title=Selective_serotonin_releasing_agent&action=edit&redlink=1) (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. However, relative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , it is considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin with properties more akin to a reuptake inhibitor in comparison. It evokes robust hyperthermia while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA. Anecdotal reports suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast. PMA has also been shown to act as a potent, reversible inhibitor of the enzyme [MAO-A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) with no significant effects on MAO-B, and the combination of this property and serotonin release is likely responsible for its high lethality potential.

It appears that PMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) . It appears that PMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) , thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities).

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects

## Toxicity and harm potential

PMA and its relative [PMMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PMMA) can be considered extremely toxic when compared to other substances such as [Methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) or [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Ingestion of PMA has been associated with severe tachycardia (abnormally high heart rate), [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure) , [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature) , and death. PMA has a relatively slow onset, causing many users to redose which causes excess toxicity.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

PMA is a stimulant in the amphetamine class. It has rarely been used intentionally, but it’s been an adulterant in the MDMA/ [MDA](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/mda/) market for decades. Due to its toxicity, which is relevant even at relatively low doses, hundreds of deaths have likely come from its use.

The initial effects of a common dose resemble MDMA in some ways, but higher doses don’t develop into an entactogen experience. Instead, the primary effects become agitation, confusion, tachycardia, hyperthermia, and hypertension.

It exerts its effects by releasing and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin. Additionally, it’s an MAO-A inhibitor, which contributes to the negative effects.

para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA), also known as 4-methoxyamphetamine (4-MA), is a designer drug of the amphetamine class with serotonergic effects. Unlike other similar drugs of this family, PMA does not produce stimulant, euphoriant, or entactogenic effects, and behaves more like an antidepressant in comparison, though it does have some psychedelic properties.
PMA has been found in tablets touted as MDMA (ecstasy) although its effects are markedly different compared to those of MDMA. The consequences of such deception have often included hospitalization and death for unwitting users. PMA is commonly synthesized from anethole, the flavor compound of anise and fennel, mainly because the starting material for MDMA, safrole, has become less available due to law enforcement action, causing illicit drug manufacturers to use anethole as an alternative.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), the effects of PMA at doses of 50 to 80 mg orally included hypertension, diethyltryptamine (DET)-reminiscent effects, distinct after-images, and some paresthesia, "intoxication" or alcohol-like intoxication, and no psychedelic effects. In clinical studies, PMA produced "excitation, other central effects, and sympathomimetic effects, but similarly no psychotomimetic effects. Animal studies suggested that PMA would have partial psychedelic effects, but this did not seem to prove true in humans. PMA only partially substituted for the psychostimulant amphetamine in drug discrimination tests. It did not substitute for MDMA in rodents, suggesting lack of entactogenic effects.

## Adverse effects

PMA has been associated with numerous adverse reactions including death. Effects of PMA ingestion include many effects of the hallucinogenic amphetamines including accelerated and irregular heartbeat, blurred vision, and a strong feeling of intoxication that is often unpleasant. At high doses unpleasant effects such as nausea and vomiting, severe hyperthermia and hallucinations may occur. The effects of PMA also seem to be much more unpredictable and variable between individuals than those of MDMA, and sensitive individuals may die from a dose of PMA by which a less susceptible person might only be mildly affected. While PMA alone may cause significant toxicity, the combination of PMA with MDMA has a synergistic effect that seems to be particularly hazardous. Since PMA has a slow onset of effects, several deaths have occurred where individuals have taken a pill containing PMA, followed by a pill containing MDMA some time afterwards due to thinking that the first pill was not active.

## Overdose

PMA overdose can be a serious medical emergency that may occur at only slightly above the usual recreational dose range, especially if PMA is mixed with other stimulant drugs such as cocaine or MDMA. Characteristic symptoms are pronounced hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, along with agitation, confusion, and convulsions. PMA overdose also tends to cause hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia, which can help to distinguish it from MDMA overdose. Complications can sometimes include more serious symptoms such as rhabdomyolysis and cerebral hemorrhage, requiring emergency surgery. There is no specific antidote, so treatment is symptomatic, and usually includes both external cooling, and internal cooling via IV infusion of cooled saline. Benzodiazepines are used initially to control convulsions, with stronger anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or thiopental used if convulsions continue. Blood pressure can be lowered either with a combination of alpha blockers and beta blockers (or a mixed alpha/beta blocker), or with other drugs such as nifedipine or nitroprusside. Serotonin antagonists and dantrolene may be used as required. Despite the seriousness of the condition, the majority of patients survive if treatment is given in time, however, patients with a core body temperature over 40 °C at presentation tend to have a poor prognosis.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

PMA acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) with weak effects on dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Its EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration values for induction of monoamine release are 166 nM for dopamine and 867 nM for norepinephrine in rat brain synaptosomes, whereas serotonin was not reported. The drug has been found to robustly increase brain serotonin levels and to weakly increase brain dopamine levels in rodents in vivo. Relative to MDMA, PMA appears to be considerably less effective as a releaser of serotonin, with properties more akin to a serotonin reuptake inhibitor in comparison.
PMA has also been shown to act as a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), specifically as a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) with no significant effects on monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of PMA for MAO-A inhibition has been reported to be 300 to 600 nM.
PMA shows very low affinities for the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors. Its affinities (Ki) for these receptors have been reported to be >20,000 nM, 11,200 nM, and >13,000 nM, respectively. In another earlier study, PMA similarly showed very weak affinity for serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors (Ki = 79,400 nM and 33,600 nM, respectively). On the other hand, PMA shows much higher affinities for the mouse and rat trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
PMA evokes robust hyperthermia in rodents while producing only modest hyperactivity and serotonergic neurotoxicity, substantially lower than that caused by MDMA, and only at very high doses. Accordingly, it is not self-administered by rodents unlike amphetamine and MDMA. Anecdotal reports by humans suggest it is not particularly euphoric at all, perhaps even dysphoric in contrast.
It appears that PMA elevates body temperatures dramatically; the cause of this property is suspected to be related to its ability to inhibit MAO-A and at the same time releasing large amounts of serotonin, effectively causing serotonin syndrome.  Amphetamines, especially serotonergic analogues such as MDMA, are strongly contraindicated to take with MAOIs.  Many amphetamines and adrenergic compounds raise body temperatures, whereas some tend to produce more euphoric activity or peripheral vasoconstriction, and may tend to favor one effect over another. It appears that PMA activates the hypothalamus much more strongly than MDMA and other drugs like ephedrine, thereby causing rapid increases in body temperature (which is the major cause of death in PMA mortalities). Many people taking PMA try to get rid of the heat by taking off their clothes, taking cold showers or wrapping themselves in wet towels, and even sometimes by shaving off their hair.

## History

PMA first came into circulation in the early 1970s, where it was used intentionally as a substitute for the hallucinogenic properties of LSD. It went by the street names of "Chicken Powder" and "Chicken Yellow" and was found to be the cause of a number of drug overdose deaths (the dosages taken being in the range of hundreds of milligrams) in the United States and Canada from that time.  Between 1974 and the mid-1990s, there appear to have been no known fatalities from PMA.
Several deaths reported as MDMA-induced in Australia in the mid-1990s are now considered to have been caused by PMA, the users unaware that they were ingesting PMA and not MDMA as they had intended. There have been a number of PMA-induced deaths around the world since then.
In July 2013, seven deaths in Scotland were linked to tablets containing PMA that had been mis-sold as ecstasy and which had the Rolex crown logo on them. Several deaths in Northern Ireland, Particularly East Belfast were also linked to "Green Rolex" pills during that month.
In 2014, 2015 and early 2016, PMA sold as ecstasy was the cause of more deaths in the United States, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and Argentina. The pills containing the drug were reported to be red triangular tablets with a "Superman" logo.
The Red Ferarri pills are a new press of the Superman logo tablets that were reported to be found in Germany and Norway from 2016 to 2017.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### International

PMA is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

#### Australia

PMA is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

#### Finland

Substance is scheduled in decree of the government on amending the government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs.

#### Germany

PMA is part of the Appendix 1 of the Betäubungsmittelgesetz. Therefore, owning and distribution of PMA is illegal.

#### Netherlands

On 13 June 2012 Edith Schippers, Dutch Minister of Health, Welfare and Sport, revoked the legality of PMA in the Netherlands after five deaths were reported in that year.

#### United Kingdom

PMA is a Class A drug in the UK.

#### United States

PMA is classified as a Schedule I hallucinogen under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States.

### Economics

#### Distribution

Because PMA is given out through the same venues and distribution channels that MDMA tablets are, the risk of being severely injured, hospitalized or even dying from use of ecstasy increases significantly when a batch of ecstasy pills containing PMA starts to be sold in a particular area. PMA pills could be a variety of colours or imprints, and there is no way of knowing just from the appearance of a pill what drug(s) it might contain. Notable batches of pills containing PMA have included Louis Vuitton, Mitsubishi Turbo, Blue Transformers, Red/Blue Mitsubishi and Yellow Euro pills. Also PMA has been found in powder form.

#### Analogues

Four analogues of PMA have been reported to be sold on the black market, including PMMA, PMEA, 4-ETA and 4-MTA.  These are the N-methyl, N-ethyl, 4-ethoxy and 4-methylthio analogues of PMA, respectively. PMMA and PMEA are anecdotally weaker, more "ecstasy-like" and somewhat less dangerous than PMA itself, but can still produce nausea and hyperthermia similar to that produced by PMA, albeit at slightly higher doses. 4-EtOA was briefly sold in Canada in the 1970s, but little is known about it. 4-MTA, however, is even more dangerous than PMA and produces strong serotonergic effects and intense hyperthermia, but with little to no euphoria, and was implicated in several deaths in the late 1990s.
