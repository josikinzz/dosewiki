It has its very own entry in TIHKAL.  You must have missed it.  It was first described in a paper on MiPT analogues published in 1981 by Shulgin and someone whos name escapes me.


4-MeO-MiPT doesn't sound very interesting (from the reports in TIHKAL), however since it is the only 4-MeO-N,N-dialkyltryptamine described in detail...it is interesting to me.  4-MeO-DET is also known to be active, but there are no human reports.


Of course, 2C-D didn't sound very interesting from Shulgin's book either...but I found it a gem.  Maybe this one is the missing link as well!

if its only half as good as 5-meo-mipt than it would still be a gem in my book.

I looked in the long index instead of just looking for it's own entry, my bad. Seems like and interesting one to me.

Me too!  But not from the described effects to much, as a unique substitution I've not tried (that being a N,N-Dialkyl-T with a 4-MeO.)

I guess it's mostly that it's sort of a cross between 4ho-mipt and 5meo-mipt that makes it seem so interesting to me. And the affects described in Tihkal wonder if the dose simply hasn't been taken high enough.

Im sure reports will be popping up in no time.

But frankly it really doesnt seem all that interesting.

Perhaps with doses above 30mg.

But i guess we'll know all this pretty soon.

I'll probably be giving this one a try, eventually.  The movement of a methoxy group around a ring has done some interesting things in the past.

Anyone venturing a guess if the methoxi group is being metabolized to Miprocin to some degree?


Edit: of course into Miprocin and not Psilocin.

I would think not to a significant degree -- the methoxy group is a lot more difficult for the body to break down here than acetoxy or oxygen (as Shulgin has noted).  I would wager most, if not all, of the effects are from the original compound rather than metabolites.

well, i take that back.


I read on another board of someone trying it and claiming it was entactogenic.

He didnt go into much detail but basically said that it reminded him of MDA and didnt feel much like a tryptamine.

^got it.

i guess in that case we must wait and evaluate the substance for ourselves.

I have to say though, i'm pretty excited about it showing up.

Hydroxide and acetone esters?  I think you mean the free phenol (4-OH, an alcohol) and the '*acetate ester*s of 4-HO-tryptamines'.

Probably will have something to report in a couple weeks. My first thought on hearing about this was that it would be similar to 4ho-mipt but perhaps more stable. Tihkal says otherwise. Based on the reports there it seems more like a less potent version of 5meo-mipt, but at higher doses, who knows? Dr. Shulgin wrote off some things prematurely, IMO. Could be the case here. Or not.

So what in particular looks so interesting about this chemical?

In tihkal not all that much is said about it, and what is said doesnt sound like something to go gaga over.

I heard it might be entactogenic but dont know how true that actually is.


the 4 ho/aco chems seem much more interesting.

Maybe if the community showed some interest in 4 ho met we'd see that pop up. That one sure does look good.

nope. You shouldnt let the name fool you into thinking that it will be like a mix of the two.

ho knows though, it could still end up being an interesting chemical, though from what i read in tihkal, nothing special.

**The Big and Dandy 4-MeO-MiPT Thread**


Merged several posts to create this new Big and Dandy thread.  Let's try this out.  Even if it turns out to be inactive or unexciting, it's good to have all the information we can compiled into a single place about obscure chemicals.  Hell, there's a B&D thread on 3C-P ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I also added it to the B&D thread list in the Best of PD page.  Enjoy!

Be advised about the weight differences for the freebase (which Shulgin assayed with) and the fumarate.  The latter is only about 80% as potent as the freebase, so Shulgin's recommended dose of around 25mg freebase will actually be up around 31mg fumarate.

I figured I wouldn't try it since the tihkal entry is so uneventful, but then I remembered that it also makes 4-aco-mipt sound pretty horribly boring too. pihkal  makes 2c-b out to be God in chemical form. Not knocking either one of them, but when you only have 3 or 4 reports it's not exactly representative of everyone, I suppose.


Who knows, it could be one of those semi-fun recreational things to do if you just want to feel slightly altered and go shopping or something.


Perhaps I'll get around to trying it after the new year.

2C-T-21 - that's a drug that could have purposely been created for people who shop!

I am betting this one will turn out to be really nice and akin in intensity to a 20mg miprocin trip at around 50mg, or not. 


I guess it might produce something worthwhile at around 60-80mg.

Two pages and not one experience report.  I count on you BLers to be early adopters and let me know what to expect...so get crackin!  I'm just kidding, but I am rather surprised that no one's made any mention of actually *trying* the stuff yet.   Based on the TiHKAL entry, I plan to try starting at around 10mg if no reports appear.

/\ seems this one is indeed an appetite-enhancer. I had had a modest dose of MDPV in the afternoon and had lost all appetite, decided to skip dinner and ingest 18mg of 4-MeO-Mipt fumarate instead.  Time seems to have been flying since I  ingested it... very comfortable, relaxed in the body+mind, perceived drop in overall tension / heart rate that had been mildly elevated by the MDPV. Mildly sedated even. Happy to just be.Moderate pupil dilation only but noticeable nevertheless.


And suddenly a massive appetite at T+1hr.  Cold Gaspatcho really does taste excellent, as does anything else that's succulent and nutritious (cold fried brown rice with yellow peppers topped with soy and sesame oil and cayenne and balsamic vinegar; whole rye crispbread with olive paste). Tastebuds very sensitive today. Little desire for the usual comfort foods (chocolate biscuits etc.) but more for wholesome fresh things.


Apart from that, hard to say what's actually going on... Could I drive a car on it? Probably if I had to, though I wouldn't want to.

Probably the other 82mg I have left of this material. Likely one 30mg trip and one 52mg trip or thereabouts. In due time, ingested when sober. I shall report then. If I find the compound promising, then perhaps, if the compound should come my way again in he future, I will find that the research will not even end there. That answer your question? 8)

Tried this again, at approx. 36mg, double my initial dose. Clearly active at this level, and physically (energetically) as tremorous and restless as 2C-T-7 pre-peak and DPT below proper breakthough levels for me. No visuals though and hardly any pupil dilation. Felt a little bit restless and had cold hands/feet, though I am not sure to what extent this was set/setting related. 


After the peak (T+2:30 quite clear again) started making music... While music was interesting, it didn't blow me away and I was unwilling (unable?) to stick to the task of playing what I was going to play and kept being sidetracked by different sonar experiments. 


All in all, in terms of mental effects I'd liken it in its subtlety to 5-MeO-DALT, another rare chem that tends to disappoint those looking for kicks but which has subtle activity. I think 5-MeO-DALT provides a warmer, more easy-going space though - although as I said, set/setting may be factors. Always hard to tell. In any case I had no trouble sleeping but woke up to day with borderline irritability levels not unlike those I get when serotonin is low. 


I have one more trial left with this material, and unless that's gonna show me the ropes I'll call it quits with 4-MeO-MIPT. Might actually just use my remaining mg to try out top-up combos with the 4-HO/ACO cousins. Like its cousin MIOT, 4-MeO-MIPt might just be most efficient when used as an adjunct.

Thanks a lot for the reports Ximot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Would you say, then, that this substance is more bodyload than anything else? hehe.

well, I remember some nausea (I'd had a huge lunch and took it later afternoon), and my sense of smell was heightened (the stench of tobacco smoke was more terrible than usual). Sense of touch just a little intensified, there's other drugs that do it better. Thoguht processes mildly altered, psy territory for sure. I had a feeling that I was more acutely aware of the 'essence' of others (watched a film during come-up and had a friend visiting at some point), resp.. how they're really feeling at that moment. But this was subtle. 


In short, yes - I guess body load made up about 50% of what I experienced. I may not have had it though if I had been calmer, who knows? That I got nauseous this time whereas last time I got hungry did surprise me a little.

Sounds like junk, as the TIHKAL entry made it seem.  We can bet for sure that none of this material is conveted to miprocin, as some have speculated.

Well, there is a fairly wide space between 18mg and 36mg.  Perhaps somewhere inbetween it will display that nice little shine, as does 5-MeO-DALT at the proper dose?

A general sense of happiness, well-being and light-heartedness is experienced, accompanied by an increased libido. Tactile sensations are slightly expanded in a manner evocative of MDMA, but only equivalent to approximately 20-25% of a typical MDMA dose. Acting upon libidinous desires was not possible at the time, so exploring that realm will be the primary focus of the next round of tests with this molecule. At this dosage, there is no body load or any discomfort. For one subject there was a temperature spike, accompanied by a brief and sudden sweat that was gone in a matter of minutes. No sense of speediness or fluttering heart rhythms.

This would be an excellent choice for the first time RC researcher as this seems to be very mild and does not promote or exacerbate any anxiety. It would seem to have no negative properties at this dose, but also does not offer any real complexity to the experienced researcher. It could offer a gentle, positive headspace to couples looking to reconnect and it's short duration makes it possible to use during the work week. On the negative: this is not a very interesting tryp on it's own and doesn't seem to have a lot to recommend it other than it's gentleness, which may only be a function of dosage. It doesn't seem to create a headspace conducive to deep introspection. As psychological food, it is NOT spicy jambalaya or szchuhuan lamb - this is meatloaf and mashed potatoes or chicken noodle soup. This is the RC version of comfort food. It feels "nice". Not spectacular, not earth-shattering, you will probably not see the face of God. It just feels nice.

> Two unanonymous people Swim1 and Swim2 took 35-40mgs of 4-meo-mipt. Within an hour both subjects felt a comeup feeling like that of a rather strong tryptamine dose. As if something big was about to happen, but it did not take the turn they expected, it stayed at a very mild state. Swim2 thought that it felt as though the chemical was teasing him, it showed signs of a trip but stayed very mild. Tracers were noticable with both subjects. Swim2 was overall dissapointed with the compound and shows little interest in further research. All it did was make swim2 want to take a different tryptamine.(the monkey was not feed another tryptamine.) Swim1 kind of liked how mild this chemical was and would try it again because there would be no anxiety about having an intense ride. However from first test this does not seem to be a very deep compound. The effects lasted around 4 hours.

**My First Trip Report Ever**


I did an insufflation trial with 4-MeO-MiPT Fumarate last night.


It was me and my girlfriend (who is not nearly as experienced with psychedelics).  I snorted 28mg and she snorted around 22mg of the 4-MeO-MiPT Fumarate.  The chemical burned our noses and the drip tasted thoroughly bad, leading my girlfriend to vomit a few hours later.  I had to drink soda for about 20 minutes to get rid of the drip, and I snorted a little water 40 minutes after to get rid of the burn, though it was already going away slowly.


I think 4-MeO-MiPT could be explored further as an antidepressant, a definite erotic enhancer/aphrodisiac, a social lubricant, or just a "feelgood" type of tryptamine.  It lasted a few hours, I didn't really pay attention to time however.  Me and my girlfriend enjoyed it.  I felt a little bit like I was under the influence of a tryptamine, my pupils were dilated too, and I was getting giggles/hysterics, but there was absolutely no visual activity except for the normal effects of dilated pupils (things seem brighter).  I had some of the best sex I've had in a damn while (3 times), and I could tell that my drive and pleasure was enhanced from the tryptamine.  True aphrodisiac power I think.  There was an ecstacy-like vibe to the feeling, maybe empathogenic effects (there is no unneeded stimulation or amphetamine-like effects from this one though).  There was a strange "good" feeling throughout my whole body while I was on it, and I felt as if the chemical had some antidepressant properties.  I felt VERY short bouts of nausea a couple of times throughout (like for 1 second I would feel a bit nauseous then it would go away).  My girlfriend vomited a few hours into it, and I think mostly from the remaining drip.  She was also complaining of a stomach ache, but I have no idea if that was due to ingestion or not.  None of these things happened to me, maybe I have a stronger stomach ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

As I have no other psychedelics for Bicycle Day, I will probably be testing this compound for the first time.  I have 60mg and was thinking about splitting it with my room mate.  Hopefuly that will be enough to at least enhance a bike ride tommorow.


Edit: Just found a gelcap with maybe 10mg of 2C-I in my safe.  Are there any reports mixing this substance with a phen especially a 2C-x?

^^^ True  I will probably just test the 4-meo-mipt probably at around 25-30mg. Maybe if I am feeling up to it, I will boost with a little 2C-I but probably not.  Will post back with my expirience with this chemical.

For some reason I exercise more caution with the Meo's than with the 4-substituted or the DMT homologues. They (the -meo's) seem to be a little more tricky on the receptors than the others.

Damn, when I woke up today, I didn't think my anxiety (I have General Anxiety) was going to be very noticeable and was planning on dropping right after class but now that I'm back from class, I feel like I may have to wait till tommorow.  I'm trying not to take any benzos today, but I don't know if that will happen, and I don't like tripping after taking benzos.

Well I am going to go meditate for a while and if I feel better after that, I will give it a try.  Thank you for the good wishes SS.

Soooo...


Anybody tried this substance at a higher dosage? Like 50-60 Mg? How far can one go and still be safe? I want to try this stuff soon.

And does it have stimulating effects at all? I'm looking for a purely psychedelic experience. Even if it's mild :/

My girlfriend and I snorted 28mg of 4-MEO-MIPT fumarate each a while back because I got a sample...  The drip was so bad that my girlfriend vomited.


My trip report is the only 4-MEO-MIPT report on Erowid I think still...

My trip report ---> [Good Aphrodisiac/Mood Enhancing Tryptamine](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=58956)


It seemed like sort of an antidepressant/aphrodisiac/mood enhancing type tryptamine.


I could tell I was tripping (giggles, body feel, etc.) but there was no hallucinations or insight to speak of.  Not nearly as much body load or stimulation as 5-MEO-DIPT (foxy), but that's the closest compound I can compare it to.  More of an "enhancer" type tryptamine, maybe one that would be good to mix with other compounds for a nice boost.  It really seemed to have antidepressant effects.  I did find it to be a little more interesting and fun than 5-MEO-DIPT (foxy), even with this one trial.


It made sex incredible (3 times), however, so it does have good effects in that department.


I would never pay money for this compound, but if it came free again, I might consider doing it again.  It did not produce hallucinations or any insight for me, just made my mood very good, lots of laughs and sex.

Anyone see taking 20mg alongside 5mg or selegline (taken yesterday)? Will there be any adverse reactions? 


Not sure if I'm supposed to start a new thread for this sort of thing? There's different rules on different forums. I've either done a good thing by not starting a new thread, or I'm a noob for bringing up dead threads 8)

I did another 50mg 4-meo-mipt on an another occasion while I still had some tolerance from a low dose 2c-t-7 the day before. Rather boring this time and a lot less intense. But I don't find this stuff to have many if any negative qualities. Still a worthwhile substance in my book.

There is a good chance you would be ok since you took a lower dose, and I know you don't really have to watch what you eat on lower doses because it does't inhibit all MAO at those levels, but you have to think if it is really worth it, especially with a chemical that has had so little research done.  I would suggest wait unless someone who knows more about these kind of things than me says otherwise.


On another note, I finally got around to trying this stuff at around 45mg.  There was some tactile enhancement, I was really giggly, and all around kind of goofy feeling.  Nothing visual really to speak of except a smoothing of colors and textures.  I could definitely could tell I was in tryptamine world.    At points I would really like it and at other times I would be bored.  An hour and a half into it, I thought it would be good idea to eat a mushroom I had laying around that was a little less than a gram.  It added to it a little bit.  I got a few CEV later on, and the general tryptamine buzz was definitely extended, but I would guess it would have had more effect had I eaten it earlier on, with the 4-meo-mipt, plus the mushroom was kind of old.  All together, if you want something that might sparkle up a boring night, and don't want to deal with a long duration or next day hangover, some 4-meo-mipt may be in order.  But, if you really want to trip, 4-meo-mipt is nothing too fascinating and you may be let down by the lack of intensity.  When there are so many more chemicals out there, I probably won't be dealing with any more 4-meo-mipt.  Like others have said, its best use is probably as an enhancer for other tryptamines.

Tried 15mg of this material tonight, might have been 20, I can't remember how much I put in the cap; it was a while back. Anyhoo emptied the cap, and dabbed about 2.5mg just to test for interactions with the selegiline I took a few days ago, waited 40 mins; no negative reaction. Took the cap, and can't say I'm overly impressed. Has wonderful anti-depressant properties, and I've been posting on 3 forums at once, but apart from that I haven't noticed anything to spellbinding. Definitely not something I would buy. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

**4-meo-mipt / help**


hey guys,

last time i ordered 4-ho-met i accidently got 4-meo-mipt.. so now i'm sittin on it and don't know what to do with it...


i tried dosages from about 10mg up to 40mg oral

the only effects i had were that i got some kind of "upcoming"-feelings and at least a headache..


i looked up 4-meo-mipt in a.shulgins tihkal and the effects shulgin talks about were almost the same like mine, so i know that it is really 4-meo-mipt and there isn't a problem with the quality


[http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal39.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal39.shtml)


now my question is: what can i do with that 4-meo-mipt? does anybody has an idea for a good combination?

can i smoke it?


i've heard that 5-subst. tryptamines are nice to smoke, but i doubt that it works with 4-meo-mipt ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


sorry for my bad english ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

hope for quick answers


so far

Tried 4-MeO-MiPT yesterday - 30 mg, it was surpsingly pleasant compound, and it exceeded my best expectations.

The onset was quite fast, the peak lasted until T+2:00, and after that I feeled the effects until T+4:00, when I took 1 mg of Phenazepam, and 3 mg to get to sleep.


The compounds itself is a nice, pleasant but very mild emphatogen, in a antidepressant kind of way. There are no muscle tension at all(no bodyload) and body felt very nice. 


I think, I'll publish a trip-report.


This report from TiHKAL is closest to my experience:

To a plus two within about ten or fifteen minutes more. Body is comfortable, mind-set pretty much unchanged from baseline. No euphoria, no insights. But also, no discomfort. Erotic was extremely successful, and orgasm seemed easier than with other materials. Still no visuals but seemed to be a soft plus three. Music fine. Hard to define exactly how we knew we were in an altered state, because of the lack of visual clues. Body aware more than mind. Would like to explore this further. Perhaps for writing? Nice material. Maybe higher next time?"

it was an interesting report indeed.


i do have a question though, but i dont htink anyone cna answer it. in the thikal report, it says at some point the subject is at a soft +3, yet no visuals, no mind set change.... it is a very strange description, as a +3 should be effects that cannot be ignored, but it seems there is nothing much to ignore.


still, this seems to be in the same vein as the 5meoDALT, no? which is also mild, friendly, and a little bit empathogenic.


im interested, as 4meo tryptamines are usually better on me than 5meo ones.


as a side note, interesting that this compound is this rare, last reports were from 2 years ago?

That's not true I think, it is available. Anyway if something is really available or public is a matter of where you draw the line. Still I have no reason to define this as unavailable. Of course the subject of discussions should not veer more towards specific vendors etc.

As far as I know 4-meo-mipt is the only 4-meo tryptamine.

Anyone have any combo experience with this chemical? Trials with Methylone proved interesting but nothing spectacular. Just wondering if anyone has any combo suggestions as this compound isn't too interesting on it's own?

This just reminded me to try my 4-MeO-MiPT and plain MiPT. I've to write this down or something - to check what a nice dose would be and weigh it for a good moment. If nothing else, consider this a question what a good starting dose might be?

I haven't seen MiPT on the market but definitely curious. I'm thinking 20mg of 4-MeO-MiPT and 15mg of 4-HO-MiPT might be a nice starting dose this Friday. I don't find 4-MeO-MiPT a complete waste but it's not that spectacular on it's own (max dose, 40mg intranasal) .

Well, SWIM has 100mgs of this chemical waiting for him at home, as hes currently on vacation until the 16th. From what he's  read he do not plan on taking it by itself even once. He will for sure take 50mgs with a couple bowls of dank, as hes experienced with bud and easily can tell how a chemical changes that high. He'll  also have LSD and MXE at his disposal. If any that have tried it could chime in on which they think it'd be preferable with that'd be great.


Also, is sub lingual/buccal dosage expected to have as high a bio-availability as oral or insuffation?

Do not say SWIM, it is against the rules here and the main reason is it doesn't help you anyway (bullshit about legal safety is illusions) and it is annoying to boot.


I couldn't comment on the material at this point since the time still has not come for me to go ahead and try it, but plain N,N-MiPT is at hand so who knows. It doesn't seem like the 4-MeO makes for such a special analogue (I mean there may not be an unusual difference), it doesn't look like it metabolizes to 4-HO-MiPT and it's sticking the wrong way for binding like 5-MeO does.

Any more reports out there on this stuff? Seems like a nice, mellow experience... similar to MDAI perhaps, can anyone compare the two?

I can't compare the two, however I finally got around to trying my small amount last night.


I take 10-15mg of Noopept daily also, if that should make any difference.


I took 40mgs orally at 10:20pm, 3.5 hours after dinner. I started to feel first alerts within 20, more of a tryptamine type coming up feeling at 45 and then peaking around an hour or hour and a half? I didn't look at the time because I was at a lake on the beach there playing in the sand. What I experienced last night was nothing like what I was expecting AT ALL. I was expecting very light effects with not much of anything however during the peak the world around me was melting and constantly being shattered by crazy visuals. It was a low light environment obviously, and the visuals were VERY pronounced. Honestly, they reminded me much more of LSD visuals than 4-AcO-DMT or DMT, although they did have some of the insect/reptilian type morphing to them. Standing in the dorm bathroom peeing with three yellow walls around me was insane. All the tile boundaries were moving, along with the yellow color of the wall fairly rapidly changing gradiently (if that's a word, gradually) in a neon rainbow of colors. The CEVs were the some of the strongest I've ever had, I could summon up whatever visuals I wanted in my head on command almost. There were fairly noticeable tracers which I've never experienced on 2c-e, LSD, or 4-AcO. Everything seemed electric and neon, similar to LSD. Also, I experienced Synesthesia! Which I've also never had. On the ride home from the lake while I was still peaking, we listened to some classic dubstep with subs and there were wiggling spirals over the road dancing and swirling and twisting to the music. Oh yes, spirals and wiggling things were common visuals.


The headspace was definitely not as mind-fucky as LSD or 4-AcO however the mental effects were still EXTREMELY strong. I had lots of trouble communicating with the friends I was with in addition to not generally being able to make decisions or comprehend what's going on as is common with psilocybin. Things were very "slowed down" and I totally understood Huxley's comments on Mescaline, being in the total present and now.


Overall, I LOVED it, much more so than I expected to. In my opinion it's a very interesting chemical that has potential.


Oh yes, in addition to very strong visuals, I had very strong auditory hallucinations also. I seriously love this chemical. If I thought of a song I'd start to hear it playing in my head legitimately along with what I perceived to be actual bass in my head when thinking of certain wubs/bass sounds from the car ride.


WORTH THE BUY!

@Psy997


Are you really sure it's 4-meo-mipt that you have? And not 4-**ho**-mipt or 4-**aco**-mipt.

Really wierd for you to have such strong effects compared to everybody else. While 40 mg  4-ho-mipt would surely give a trip like the one you've had.

bumping this to the top, im curious about this chemical


Has anyone smoked/vaped this chemical? 


I have experience with vaping 5-meo-dalt and 5-meo-mipt, but no mention if this compound is active that way.

I got some on the way. Pretty excited to try and will report my findings right away!


From PIHKAL's description it sounds very much like a more sensual MiPT which sounds pretty good to me, **psy997**'s description sounds even better 8)

Yea that was quite the experience I had back in 2012... Still one of the most phenomenologically unique and intense experiences I've ever had.


Looking back with more tryptamine experience, I would bet a decent sum of cash that it was 4-ho or 4-aco-mipt. But, I wouldn't know unless I could try all three to compare now.

Tried it yesterday at 20mg. White chalky powder, fluffy - looks more than it actually weighs. 


Started feeling it in about an hour and by two hours it was very obvious! Its such a gentle compound - it feels so transparent and light, unbelievable! :D


No side effects whatsoever (a little BP and pulse rise), hard to fall asleep 6 hours later too. No nausea or stomach disturbances, not even the typical tryptamine come-up, when you feel that reality mashing up and restructuring - it was gentle, nice and fuzzy, as a calm afternoon ocean breeze, not a hint of anxiety, very tranquil experience.


No visuals but overall noticeable brightness amplification similar to AL-LAD in style. 

4-MeO-MiPT produces a very special head space, wonderful "organic" euphoria, both physical and mental, body becomes weightless with it too. I enjoyed music on it and was even dancing around because of how much my body wanted to move.


Thinking process is clear and piercing, reading and writing is superb, good body balance too, good energy, definite erotic potential. I see so many uses for this compound! 8)

It feels in the middle of 4-AcO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT - stimulating, uplifting, bright, empathogenic, clear and sparkly.


Three hours in to the trip I took a few milligrams of my home made cannabis oil and then vaporized a lot of it too - man, it felt sooo good! Thats the type of psychedelic you really want to mix with weed! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Summing up the action: come up in an hour, peak by two hour mark, peak lasts for two hours and then gentle come down with being back at baseline fully by the 7th hour. Next day there was a mild pleasant afterglow, similar to 4-AcO-MiPT.


I liked it a lot, really want to take it again today, if I do, I'll let you know how big is a tolerance with it.


I think it will make a good combo with 2C-B-Fly...8)

Took 20mg of 4-MeO-MiPT next day, mixed with 3mg of 5-MeO-MiPT to make up for potential tolerance and yes, the tolerance was really observable. I still felt pretty nice but nowhere near the first trial. I'd say, pretty strong tolerance for such mild effects.

Nice report, this chemical actually has a lot more potential than I first thought. 

What it interest me so much as the body high and the possible eroticism tied to 5-Meo-mipt, so you would think the same one follow for 4-meo-mipt.....

What I always found so special about 4 sub tryptamines was the body high associated with it 4-ho-met has a really cool body high. 

Would you say that it is much more euphoric than, say a low dose of 5-Meo-mipt? I know high doses of that particular compound can be kind of rough. If so this sounds worth while

Definite eroticism and general disinhibition is noticed with 4-MeO-MiPT. The body high is definitely there, I will take it again tomorrow with my girl, at 30mg and let you know how it went! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I got some today and tried a 30mg dose. It was pretty boring. Does it get more fun or interesting at high doses? I have a lot left so I'm going to try it again. I might take 45 or 50 mg next time. Maybe I just need to take it in a different setting.

Me and three other people I know took 4-MeO-MiPT at doses variying from 20 to 50mg few times. Results are: 


I am affected by it but not strongly, feeling positive glow and mild euphoria with floaty happy headspace, excellent with cannabis, pro-sexual, will definitely repeat. Goes nicely with 5-MeO-MiPT, 4-HO-MPT, Phenibut.


My girl got strong anxiety form it that eventually grew into euphoric and functional state, she will repeat if only taken with Phenibut or Pregabalin, noticed 4-MeO to be pro-sexual as well.


Friend #1 (with little psychedelic exp) got strong anxiety and started tripping pretty hard on 35mg of it. Strongly pro-sexual and confusing, most likely will not repeat or repeat in much lower dosage.


Friend #2 (huge psychedelic exp) got barely discernible from placebo experience on 40mg. When added 25mg of 4-HO-MPT, it blossomed into a very unique and sensual trip with nice visuals. Will repeat but only at larger doses and mixed with the leading depth psychedelic, combined very well with ETH-LAD for him.


4-MeO-MiPT is a weird one for sure! Also causes surprisingly strong psychedelic tolerance for the next couple of days after consumption.

Awesome to see this one finally getting some attention again.... Been waiting a while to learn more just what it's all about. Thanks much for all the reporting, Volsam. :D


Out of curiosity, your friend that started tripping hard on 35 mg, was it still all mental or were there any visuals too?

It's so good to see you post again, **Kaleida**! :D


The friend who started tripping on 35mg of 4-MeO-MiPT claims he had visuals on it but not like with mushrooms or LSD (stuff he tried before). He said the visuals were melting and disorienting, not colorful or strongly defined but strong nevertheless.


I have noticed similar tendency as with 5-MeO-MiPT in terms of it's effects, and visuals including - sparkly, mildly glowing, defined edges. I even tried mixing the 4-MeO with 5-MeO-MiPT to a great success and synergy. 


It might sound pretty uneducated but IME 4-MeO-MiPT effects are right in the middle between 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT effects.


As I remember, **Kaleida**, you are a fan of Moxy, I wonder what your opinion on this 4-MeO variation will be?..8)

Yeahhhh those are two of my all-time faves, gonna have to grab some of this. Wanted to try a new 4-sub when I grab more 4-aco-dmt so I think this fits the bill perfectly. Hope I can get good effects at a reasonable dose. FWIW it would make sense that visuals could be difficult to bring out given how high most have to dose moxy in order to get visuals; I have to take at least 15mg or so but get good psychedelia from 8mg. Moxy also has that difficult come-up so that could align with the anxiety your peeps were feeling.

I took 50mg today and I've concluded that this stuff is complete junk. Besides some subtle color enhancement, the effects are not psychedelic at all. No psychedelic thought patterns, no entactogenic effects, no music enhancement, none of the erotic enhancement I've seen some people claim (which I do get from MiPT and 4-HO-MiPT BTW). It's just mild stoned headspace and physical side effects. The body high isn't bad, but it isn't that good either. It feels totally different from the typical tryptamine body high. The mental effects were not really fun and made me feel slightly annoyed or apathetic at times. I guess it could be enjoyable for people who just love drugs and don't want to be sober.


It's interesting that Volsam's experiences were so positive. Perhaps it's a difference in body chemistry. There is speculation that certain people metabolize 5-MeO-MiPT into 5-HO-MiPT, resulting in different effects. It is possible that some people metabolize 4-MeO-MiPT into 4-HO-MiPT?

Here's a link to my report:


[(4-MeO-MiPT / ~20mg) - First Time - "Nice, But Not A Psychedelic"](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/842761-(4-MeO-MiPT-20mg)-First-Time-quot-Nice-But-Not-A-Psychedelic-quot)


Who knows, though - it's just one person, one time, one dose, one ROA.


In answer to Kaleida's question about visuals, I can say that there were none at all for me, nor did I get the feeling that they would manifest with a higher dose fwiw. While I personally didn't find it to be psychedelic, that doesn't mean that someone psychedelic naive wouldn't.

 I guess I do love drugs...8) but I do like to be sober too.

4-MeO-MiPT feels more as an anti-depressant and sensual enhancer than typical psychedelic, subtle but very enjoyable (at least to me). But thats how I utilize 5-MeO-MiPT too - only in low doses mostly for enhancing mood and fooling around erotically with my girl. 4-MeO feels comfortable, safe and pleasurable to me, dont know why.


You guys can send me your baggies if you want to trash it! Just kidding of course...![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Maybe my judgement was a little harsh. It's pretty disappointing if you're expecting it to be comparable to other tryptamines, but I can see how people might like it. Still though, even if you enjoy it, the price seems high for what you're getting.

It's good to see you again too, Volsam. :D I hope things have been going well for you in my absence! I've been busy but things have generally been pretty good over here, much better than usual even, glad to be getting back into this scene a bit again now for sure.


Thanks much for the information. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I can definitely understand that sort of thing, it sounds a lot like the kind of visuals that dominate for me on higher dosages of 4-HO-EPT or other things that are powerful but not too visual for me in a classical sense. Very interesting that you compare it to 5-MeO-MiPT too.... I am indeed a big fan of that one so far and think I may actually be a bit sensitive to it as I get some pretty powerful visual and visionary effects from it even at 8 mg, so it would be quite interesting see how I would react to this one too. It does seem like there may be something bizarre or unique going on with its pharmacology but nonetheless maybe I'd at least get something, won't know until I try anyway....


It probably won't be in the near future but I'd definitely love to get my hands on some while it's around again!

Thanks much for the response. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Yeah, it kind of sounds like it has some parts of the psychedelic pharmacology, but not the most core parts.... Given that Volsam's friend did get those at least more dissociating or disorienting style visuals from it it may still have some potential at least nonetheless, but that's still nothing too crazy.

Agreed. Oh, I should have mentioned earlier that I was still feeling the same anti-depressant afterglow vibe from the 4-MeO-MiPT seven days later, at least it seemed like it. Not bad for something so gentle and mild!

I'm inclined to believe that this is psychoactive, but not psychedelic. I don't know what class of material this is, or if we even have a category for it. Classing it as a psychedelic is going to cause confusion due to the improperly biased orientation when viewing the experience. We had the same issue with MDMA once upon a time. Just look at the PIHKAL entry--the prototypical empathogen described without a single reference to empathy. See below:   


> (with 100 mg) MDMA intrigued me because everyone I asked, who had used it, answered the question, 'What's it like?' in the same way: 'I don't know.' 'What happened?' 'Nothing.' And now I understand those answers. I too think nothing happened. But something seemed changed. Before the 'window' opened completely, I had some somatic effects, a tingling sensation in the fingers and temples--a pleasant sensation, not distracting. However, just after that there was a slight nausea and dizziness similar to a little too much alcohol. All these details disappeared as I walked outside. My mood was light, happy, but with an underlying conviction that something significant was about to happen. There was a change in perspective both in the near visual field and in the distance. My usually poor vision was sharpened. I saw details in the distance that I could not normally see. After the peak experience had passed, my major state was one of deep relaxation. I felt that I could talk about deep or personal subjects with special clarity, and I experienced some of the feeling one has after the second martini, that one is discoursing brilliantly and with particularly acute analytical powers.
> 		
> Click to expand...


> (with 100 mg) Beforehand, I was aware of a dull, uncaring tiredness that might have reflected too little sleep, and I took a modest level of MDMA to see if it might serve me as a stimulant. I napped for a half hour or so, and woke up definitely not improved. The feeling of insufficient energy and lack of spark that I'd felt before had become something quite strong, and might be characterized as a firm feeling of negativity about everything that had to be done and everything I had been looking forward to. So I set about my several tasks with no pleasure or enjoyment and I hummed a little tune to myself during these activities which had words that went: 'I shouldn't have done that, oh yes, I shouldn't have done that, oh no, I shouldn't have done that; it was a mistake.' Then I would start over again from the beginning. I was stuck in a gray space for quite a while, and there was nothing to do but keep doing what I had to do. After about 6 hours, I could see the whole mental state disintegrating and my pleasant feelings were coming back. But so was my plain, ornery tiredness. MDMA does not work like Dexedrine.

> (with 120 mg) I feel absolutely clean inside, and there is nothing but pure euphoria. I have never felt so great, or believed this to be possible. The cleanliness, clarity, and marvelous feeling of solid inner strength continued throughout the rest of the day, and evening, and through the next day. I am overcome by the profundity of the experience, and how much more powerful it was than previous experiences, for no apparent reason, other than a continually improving state of being. All the next day I felt like 'a citizen of the universe' rather than a citizen of the planet, completely disconnecting time and flowing easily from one activity to the next.

> (with 120 mg) As the material came on I felt that I was being enveloped, and my attention had to be directed to it. I became quite fearful, and my face felt cold and ashen. I felt that I wanted to go back, but I knew there was no turning back. Then the fear started to leave me, and I could try taking little baby steps, like taking first steps after being reborn. The woodpile is so beautiful, about all the joy and beauty that I can stand. I am afraid to turn around and face the mountains, for fear they will overpower me. But I did look, and I am astounded. Everyone must get to experience a profound state like this. I feel totally peaceful. I have lived all my life to get here, and I feel I have come home. I am complete.

    Reading reports from around the web, they strike me as awfully similar to these I?ve listed below. Sorry about the block quotes ? Bluelight?s native editor is giving me grief with paragraphs tonight, and I can?t find a BBC code solution.  

[One](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/846225-(4-MeO-MiPT-40-mg-oral)-first-time-Vestiges?p=14350784)

> "Effects feel like stray afterthoughts, accidentally letting themselves be known- subtle blips of color, sudden flashes of tracers, all briefly stumbling their way into existence. They seem like they are on the threshold of edging their way into my perception, apprehensive and unsure about whether or not to manifest. They are fluttery, fleeting, and ephemeral. This is not like light threshold effects-rather it feels like the vestiges of a full-fledged psychedelic experience briefly dipping their fingers into this otherwise mild voyage. Even with my eyes closed, there is not much to perceive or grasp on to. I feel mostly functional and sober were it not for the shaking and discomfort. This experience is so light and mild, all of the effects are nothing but brief flashes, disappearing before I can properly grasp ahold of them. It does not feel as though it has affected my emotional or cognitive processes much, other than a sort of robotic analytical perspective on everything and the same rambling thoughts and overanalyzing that comes with almost any substance I take. I feel a bit numb and cold and I am lying very still, the drug has occupied my nerves and muscles and set them down like a blanket of snow."

> "Felt too silly to even consider sex and there is no better birth control than laughter. No visual disturbances, none of the hallmarks of a chemical with hallucinogenic properties. There's no body load, but there's also nothing worth writing about. It was just a nice, gentle, happy high. Nothing special whatsoever - about as deep as a mudpuddle."

> "Lightness and mild euphoria. No disturbances to the visual field, both auditory and visual acuity are normal. A general sense of happiness, well-being and light-heartedness is experienced, accompanied by an increased libido. Tactile sensations are slightly expanded in a manner evocative of MDMA, but only equivalent to approximately 20-25% of a typical MDMA dose. Acting upon libidinous desires was not possible at the time, so exploring that realm will be the primary focus of the next round of tests with this molecule. At this dosage, there is no body load or any discomfort. For one subject there was a temperature spike, accompanied by a brief and sudden sweat that was gone in a matter of minutes. No sense of speediness or fluttering heart rhythms...this is a very mild experience, and would be good for times when simply elevating one's mood is all that is desired...an excellent choice for the first time Research Chemical researcher as this seems to be very mild and does not promote or exacerbate any anxiety...it would seem to have no negative properties at this dose, but also does not offer any real complexity to the experienced researcher...It could offer a gentle, positive headspace to couples looking to reconnect and it's short duration makes it possible to use during the work week...this is not a very interesting tryp on it's own and doesn't seem to have a lot to recommend it other than it's gentleness, which may only be a function of dosage. It doesn't seem to create a headspace conducive to deep introspection. As psychological food, it is NOT spicy jambalaya or szchuhuan lamb - this is meatloaf and mashed potatoes or chicken noodle soup. This is the Research Chemical version of comfort food. It feels 'nice'. Not spectacular, not earth-shattering, you will probably not see the face of God. It just feels nice."

> "10 mg inufflated. Alert in 5 min, onset of effects by 15 minutes, and peaked around 30-45 minutes. Wore off in about 2 hours. Same feeling as the oral but a bit more intense and short lived. No visual effects at all, not even an enhancement of colors. Sounds were a bit distorted / misinterpreted -the fishtank water bubbling sounded like a the news was on the TV, but when SWIM turned around, it was off. SWIM also occasionally heard voices in background noise. SWIM experienced a few episodes of seeing thing out of the corner of SWIM's eye that were not there. The tryptamine buzz was present, but was unable to manifest in any sense. Even tactile stimulation was about the same, but I felt altered. The buzz was a mild cross between 5meoDIPT and methylone without any of the bodyload, stimulation or strong visual / tactile effects (of the former). At this level, this molecule was recreational, and certainly more worthwhile than the 30mg oral dose. I could have gone out, been social, and would have had a good time. Mildly stimulating, but nothing intense and no change in pupil diameter. Two 5 mg boosters had minimal effects. The first at t-2:30 extended the effects for about another hour, and another boost at that time basically did nothing. Overall, there does seem to be hope of a more worthwhile effect in this and other parenteral methods of administration. I feel it was about 3x stronger and more intense. The fact that the second booster did nothing makes me think it might antagonize its own effect faster than other tryptamines, hence the rapid and potent tolerance...intends to assay again with this mode of admin at a higher dose; this might be one which is worth IM admin as well. It feels like there is something good there - something entactogenic - but it might just be an elusive, ephemeral tease."

It lasted a few hours, I didn't really pay attention to time however. Me and my girlfriend enjoyed it. I felt a little bit like I was under the influence of a tryptamine, my pupils were dilated too, and I was getting giggles/hysterics, but there was absolutely no visual activity except for the normal effects of dilated pupils (things seem brighter). I had some of the best sex I've had in a damn while (3 times), and I could tell that my drive and pleasure was enhanced from the tryptamine. True aphrodisiac power I think. There was an ecstacy-like vibe to the feeling, maybe empathogenic effects (there is no unneeded stimulation or amphetamine-like effects from this one though). There was a strange 'good' feeling throughout my whole body while I was on it, and I felt as if the chemical had some antidepressant properties. I felt VERY short bouts of nausea a couple of times throughout (like for 1 second I would feel a bit nauseous then it would go away)...I would recommend it not to someone looking to 'trip', but to someone looking for a more mild, enjoyable, and fun experience. I did not reach above a ++ the whole time. I definitely did not hit a +++. I had fun, and would do it again (though I would prefer a tryptamine that has more visual effects), but I would not pay to order more of it, it's not worth that much to me. This chemical felt to me like the dose needed to be upped, like it wasn't high enough and we possibly were not feeling the FULL effects of this compound. I could be completely wrong, maybe these are the full desired effects with an ambiguous tryptamine like this..."

But 4-MeO-MiPT is more pleasant. I liked it more than 5-MeO-DALT, and I am going to experiment with this compound in the future."

Erotic was extremely successful, and orgasm seemed easier than with other materials. Still no visuals but seemed to be a soft plus three. Music fine. Hard to define exactly how we knew we were in an altered state, because of the lack of visual clues. Body aware more than mind. Would like to explore this further. Perhaps for writing? Nice material. Maybe higher next time?"

> Third trip: 100mg 4-MeO-MiPT (last trip 7d prior) "The come-up was easy, with no real negative body load. What visuals I got were pretty mild but, again, the letters from the tiles were present. The one intense visual effect was in response to music, which would make my vision blur with the beat. However, even that was incredibly short in duration, maybe 20 minutes. Even the empathogenic properties, while still there, were less than what I had on the second trip, with the smaller dose of 4-MeO and AL-LAD. Comedown was again pretty long and not especially interesting or fun, though manageable. Overall, I think it might be something to look into adding to an MDMA-like cocktail. It's probably not worth it to take on its own, and it's really pricey in relation to its potency and effects. I may try it again in combination with 1P."

> "I liked this experience. Subtle, warm and cosy. Being social was enhanced and liked. Didn?t feel trapped in a stream of thoughts or just being too space to really be social. No anxiety whatsoever, probably thanks to Phenibut as well. I?d say 4-MeO-MiPT is the little sister of 5-MeO-MiPT. It shares the sensual aspects of Moxy, but less intense and no hints of body load. Mentally it makes me a little less euphoric than Moxy, but cosier. 4-MeO-MiPT did score very low on introspection, I usually have some with Moxy. But I felt more social because of this, with Moxy I sometimes tend to get stuck in words. I can?t speak or even formulate sentences in my head sometimes with Moxy. 20mg of 4-MeO-MiPT felt equal to around 4-5mg of 5-MeO-MiPT. I think it?s strength lies in that I feel more social on 4-MeO-MiPT and that my mind was less focussed on thoughts or bodily sensations (which are a little more unpredictable and random with Moxy). Didn?t notice the same taste enhancement with 4-MeO-MiPT as with Moxy. Music enhancement could have been there slightly, but not impressively either. Mostly just tactile enhancement...I would recommend 4-MeO-MiPT, but not if you?re looking for a psychedelic experience. This was one of the least psychedelic chems I have tried, but what it did was positive. It can be used for the same goals as lower dosages of Moxy, but I feel this chem is smoother and less bumpy. It?s nice for a casual night chilling with friends or your lover. Possibly for some movie immersion as well."

> Click to expand...
  Increasing the dose substantially doesn't increase the intensity of the experience in the manner of a psychedelic, nor does changing the route of administration seem to do so either. Common (but not universal) elements of experiences seem to include emotional activity (empathogenesis or blunting), increases to appetite, tactile effects, increased eroticism, contentment, anxiety reduction, and somatic side-effects (mostly hyperthermia, sweating, discomfort).   Several people compare the experience to a less-stimulating version of 5-MeO-DALT, so perhaps there are two drugs in this category.   I just wanted to compile some of this information into this Big & Dandy, as it wasn't looking even Small & Handy, and it's hard to find decent information on this unusual material.

> **Currently:** Physically tired, a little sunburned, a little dehydrated from a day hiking in the woods with new friends. Feeling upbeat and happy. Felt low physically yesterday due to sleep deprivation, but feel much better today. I have no tolerance to psychedeics, and the only drugs I've had today were caffeine. I did ingest some herbs (ashwagandha, reishi, licorice, and turmeric.) Happy to be home relaxing with my friend. Ate well today, but not a ton. Two hours ago, I had a very light snack of a bag of bugles and some iced tea, so my stomach is probably empty. I've also dad the makings of a headache all day that never decided to manifest.

I love *5*-MeO-MiPT, but it's long and gives me strong cross tolerance--it'd be great if this was a viable alternative. TBH, I'm not horny now, but I might feel differently when I wind down and have a shower.

> **7:30 PM** Weighed out 15mg (+/- 5mg as scale was acting up despite calibration) of material sold as 4-MeO-MiPT and parachuted it. Plan to test the waters from here, maybe take another 5mg after I get a feel for it/

> 
> **8:04 -** Possibly at a +, but just barely. I feel some warmth and tryptamine weirdness in my body, a slight headspace alteration. On balance, more unpleasant than pleasant, but too mild to be anything at all. I feel a little flutter of stimulation/anxiety like the feeling of jitters the time before you have sex with a new partner, but very mild. I also detect a bit of impulsivity as if I have some alcohol disinhibiton.

> 
> 
> Thinking about taking the 5mg booster, although it's possible that I'm still coming up. I've seen it written, though, that impatiently redosing *5*-MeO-MiPT can keep you trapped in the early euphoric stages, preventing you from reaching the later psychedelic ones. Not sure if that makes any difference with this material, especially with its short duration.

> 
> 
> 
> **8:11 -** Rise up to a ++ almost immediately after dosing. Whoops, can't have kicked in THAT fast...   The feeling is one of warmth in the body, primarily. There's no stimuation, and very little headspace. It's comfortable.
> 
> 
> 
> **8:41 - **The erotic was a fail. While I wasn't horny earlier, it doesn't take much for me, and I was really looking forward to an erotic night in. This material surprised me with a strangely unerotic headspace. Unerotic, not totally anaphrodesiac like I find mushrooms to me, where sex sounds repellant or anathema. It's actually a bit like 4-AcO-EPT: very comfortable and a little self-contained. This is milder, though. I still felt affection, but absolutely no desire. Well, I felt some pretty strong desire for the pizza in the fridge, but not sex. I REALLY wanted pizza. Otherwise, I was mostly in a cerebral frame. Erection was possible, but never have I had to work this hard for it on a psychedelic. 
> 
> 
> 
> It was a little like I've heard MDMA described, where intimacy was enjoyable, and while sex seemed like a fine way to express it, I just wasn't into it. I enjoyed touching and being touched, but it was just kind of fine. I respond idiosyncratically to MDMA, so if this shares a similar mechanism (say 5HT1a agonism?) that could be why. Also, this didn't make me feel noticeably more intimate, just a bit more open and a bit more disinhibited. I attempted orgasm on my own just to see if it was possible. It was, but it took some work and wasn't all that satisfying. The orgasm was weird--it was strong, but not impactful, resonating alongside the singing viola strings of my nervous system as they kept playing that placid chord of pleasant contentment. 
> 
> 
> 
> Despite that, there is some tactile enhancement. I spontaneously noticed and enjoyed the sensation of walking barefoot on the floor, at least a little bit. Pulling clothes on gave me a few waves of cold shivers, too, but none of this played into eroticism.

> **9:26 - **Still starving, but somehow haven't gotten around to eating. I think this is an appetite enhancer, or maybe my hunger and libido switches got crossed (would't be the first time.) I'm still at a solid ++. 
> 
> 
> 
> Music isn't enhanced, though. I haven't noticed any OEVs, and CEVs are ludicrously faint and subtle, like a highly detailed shimmering gloss streamer across whatever phosphenes happen naturally. Basically absent. Side effects are absent, too. I could see muscle tension arising at higher doses, but nothing at this level. It does have a little of that gritty, grimey body feel that 5-MeO-MiPT has, but with less going on (like pleasurable body energies and tactile enhanceent) to distract from it. It's fine, though.

> 
> 
> Despite the relaxing nature and lack of stimulation, it might be hard to sleep? Tough to say. My pupils are finally substantially dilatedThere's not really a lot more to say. It's pleasant and stoning. Maybe revisit with freebasing and vaporization? 
> 
> 
> 
> **9:40 **- I still feel like I could go out in public at this level, especially to events where a little inebriation would be expected. It's hard to be sure, but I think it'd be pretty easy and not unpleasant. This has no hint of anxiety to it. It's also not one to leave me incapacitated and bored. I feel like I could read, game, surf the internet, watch movies, whatever right now without being all that debilitated. I'm not sure how long I would be entertained by just listening to music. I find it hard to do that as an activity anymore unless I've taken a psychedelic. While this wouldn't enhance my experience, it might reduce my racing mind and restless desire to do something else without coloring the music much if at all. This could be a nice booster psychedelic for other psychedelics based on it's clarity, positivity, and neutrality. A psychedelic salt, as I've heard 5-MeO-MET referred to. I'm not sure of the best ROA.

> 
> 
> 
> **10:30 **- Effects have definitely started downswing. I'm still feeling them strongly, yet I feel like I could sleep. I am still quite hungry, with brief bits of horniness. Don't feel like I'd even need alcohol or a benzo or anything to sleeep.
> 
> 
> 
> **11:26** - Went to bed and fell asleep relatively easily. The body energy was still springy within me, feeling a lot like rubberbands or a trampoline membrane. Tense, but yielding. A higher dosage could have kept me up, I think. At this dosage, it seemed like the mental peace counteracted the body energy well enough to sleep within fifteen minutes.
> 
> 
> 
> **Next day:** Slept soundly and well, waking with a lot of the same feeling of relaxation and emotional contentedness. Honestly, as light and functional as the experience was, it was a lot like I was still experiencing effects. 
> 
> 
> 
> **Conclusion:** Although I didn't get much out of this or see any immediate use, I could see myself exploring this material further. It's short duration, positivity, and total absence of side-effects makes it a low-commitment endeavor to explore to see if there's utility. 
> 
> 
> 
> Did I enjoy it? Meh. It wasn't at all unpleasant, but apart from experiencing a change of consciousness I didn't get much out of it. I'm not one to smoke pot and watch Netflix, but that's where this seemed to fit in the taxonomy of experiences. I DID notice a quieting of internal dialog from a frenetic pace to one where it was more calm and deliberate. This might be good for acute anxiety (apart from the come-up jitters.) 
> 
> 
> 
> It defintely felt lighter and less serious than 5-MeO-MiPT, but I didn't see much resemblance at all to 4-HO/AcO-MiPT. My friend thinks of 4-HO-MiPT as "super pot," though--a connection I could definitely see being made with this material. For me, it was more like very subdued mix of the effects of 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-B-Fly, and perhaps the emotional contentment of 4-AcO-EPT. I suppose I will revisit this orally in the future; I'd like to explore other ROAs, but the duration will likely be too short.
> 
> 
> 
> Like MDMA, I feel this material may need to be reclassified from psychedelic into a new, unknown category. From reading what the dozen or so published reports, it seems that no one has described any significant, classical psychedelic headspace shifts at any dosage or ROA. Massive increases in dosage seem to produce increases in intensity, but with no emergent psychedelia. So if not a psychedelic, what is it? And what can that tell us about structure activity relationships?

> 
> **The bodyfeel: **
> 
> Here's what it isn't. While it is mellowing, its action is not sedative like a depressant. While it is anxiolytic, it doesn't feel much like a benzodiazepine. While it is stoning, it doesn't feel particularly cognitively stultifying or blunting. While it is like a warm and comforting blanket, it doesn't feel much like an opiate. It really does feel like someone has decoupled the pleasant body energy and somatic sensations that pretty reliably accompany 5-MeO-MiPT, 2C-B-Fly, or 4-AcO-EPT from the rest of the spectrum of psychedelic experience. Psychedelics throw down the gauntlet, presenting the user with a challenge, an opportunity for growth. This does the opposite, blanketing the user firmly in positivity and contentment. I could see this being potentially useful to those wanting to work with deep materials that are notoriously either neutral or fickle, perhaps mushrooms or 2C-E. Combining them and adjusting the doses down for synergy *might* make them less intimidating without the clouding that benzodiazepines can cause. Still, this is unknown terrain. We know nothing about the possible health risks of combining this with other drugs. I've read only one combination report with a 4-substituted tryptamine, and it indicated that there was definite potentiation. I would love to see some ligand binding assays on this to see its affinities for 5HT2a vs 5HT1a, just to rule that out. Sasha might be right about this one - if it has similar ki values as 4-HO-MiPT, it could provide some great insight into structure activity relationships.

> This can be summed up succinctly. Thoughts quieted and racing thoughts stilled, focusing my inner monologue. There was a little bit of disinhibition. Anxiety diminished as a feeling of warm contentment grew within me, feeling strangely antidepressant. These effects lingered long into the following day. I would love to see neuroimaging studies on this material, particularly on brain region connectivity and default mode network activity. It would be interesting to see if this produces default mode network suppression or not based on its anti-anxiety/depressant effects. As some researchers have theorized that psychedelics produce their effect by increasing brain connectivity, it would be interesting to see if this non-psychedelic psychedelic produces connectivity comparable to its truly psychedelic analogs.

Some of this fell into my lap and I'm thinking of giving it a shot today, soon, at 25mg.  I'll make sure to report back if I do.  I've got 100mg to play with so I'll try it by itself, perhaps in a higher dose, and as an adjunct with something else to test synergy.

I think it's a fascinating material. I have absolutely no idea what to make of it. My notes suggest to me that less may be more with it, as pushing the dose higher seemed to get me further from where I wanted to be, but who knows? I actually planned to revisit it this weekend through vaporization, but postponed since I'm still recovering from the flu. Didn't want to bias the trial by going into it with a poor set. Glad I didn't, as I instead had my first negative experience with vaporized MET, something I'm truly shocked is even possible.

I just can't wrap my head around 4-MeO-MiPT. I've actually been reading books on phenomenology and embodiment to get a grasp on how to reckon with nebulous experiences like the space it evokes.

Turns out I enjoyed it immensely.  It's definitely far more empathogen than psychedelic.  It started out purely recreational/euphoric and then I spent a few hours going on an endless mental journey through emotional content, complete with a soundtrack so strong I could practically physically hear it, that proved quite useful to me.  I'm putting together a report.


Aw man... I was going to order some, I liked it so much, but they're sold out. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)  Oh wait maybe not...

> I recently received a gift of samples of several tryptamines I did not previous have, from a friend who in turn was gifted some other rarities by me.  One of them was 4-MeO-MiPT, an unusual substance I had been curious to try for some time.  To my knowledge, it is the only tryptamine ever tasted by anyone with a methoxy on the 4-position, making it quite unique.  I've read many of the available reports (there are not many despite it being available for some time), and I wasn't sure what to expect.  Some people found it to be a dud, while others enjoyed it.  Everyone seemed to agree it was not particularly psychedelic, but more of an empathogen, if anything.  On an early February Sunday, I decided there was only one way to find out, and I tasted it myself.  What follows is my notes and thoughts on the experience.
> 
> 
> 
> **3:45pm *(T+0:00)*** - Ingested 25mg orally after weighing it out.  It has a very weird taste, unlike any other tryptamine or other drug I've tried.  Not very bitter, almost a bit savory combined with the faint taste of something burned?  It's hard to describe.  It doesn't taste much like other tryptamines I've tasted and was not particularly unpleasant, nor pleasant.  The appearance was as an extremely fine, nondescript white powder, Not particularly fluffy but not too dense either.
> 
> 
> 
> **4:03pm *(T+0:18)*** - First alert, a smooth, warm feeling, and a hint of euphoria.  My girlfriend and I are about to go to Ace Hardware to get a part to fix the shower.  I spent the last hour taking it apart... it's the diverter valve from the faucet to the showerhead.  I finally sawed away at the fiberglass shower wall behind the face plate enough to get a wrench in there and unscrew it.  It's definitely broken, so here's hoping they have the right part.
> 
> 
> 
> **4:30pm *(T+0:45)*** - Just got back from the hardware store.  They did have the part.  My girl and I had a great time in there.  Very quickly I started to feel it coming up, but there's no hint of anxiety or discomfort whatsoever, it's a very warm, smooth, lovely feeling.  By the time we made the 7 minute drive over there, I felt jovial and loose, and I found a smile fixed on my face.  There is definite euphoria and a comfortable, easy feeling.  We found the part rather quickly, or rather, my girl did.  Her finding it first sparked some fun teasing back and forth between us and I found a lot of joy in that.  We were really happy that we weren't going to have to go all the way to Home Depot so we were feeling pretty celebratory in the aisle.  A lady who worked there came up to us and told us she'd never seen anyone so excited to be in the hardware store before.  I don't remember what I said but it made her laugh.  I felt so centered and comfortable, I found myself wanting to interact with the other people around, whereas generally I would interact if addressed, and not be stressed about it or anything, but I would feel more apt to keep to myself and get in and get out.
> 
> 
> 
> **4:47pm *(T+1:02)*** - Fixed the shower.  Fuck yeah!  As soon as I turned the water back on and it worked perfectly, the lyrics and melody from Simon & Garfunkel's *Cecilia* entered my head:
> 
> 
> 
> *Jubilation!
> 
> She loves me again
> 
> I fall on the floor and I'm laughing*
> 
> 
> 
> It describes how I feel right now.  This state is really very lovely.  It reminds me of both 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT (imagine that!), but it's much gentler than 5-MeO-MiPT and less psychedelic than either.  It really is more of an empathogenic feeling than a psychedelic one, except there's that tryptamine feeling to it, a sort of fluttery-in-the-face and chest feeling that marks it surely as an indole.  5-MeO-MiPT can have some sharp edges and is stimulating, and 4-HO-MiPT is a full-blown psychedelic and can be disorienting, but this stuff is 100% easygoing and probably more euphoric than either.
> 
> 
> 
> **5:00pm *(T+1:15)*** - Smoked a hit of weed.  This is quite recreational for me right now, in fact I find myself wanting to redose but I'm not going to.  There is no amount of dopamine hit here, there's no rush, but I am feeling a good amount of euphoria and a feeling of everything being alright.  I feel warm and loving.  It reminds me of the post-peak plateau of 4-HO-MiPT a lot.  The weed hasn't changed it at all but it has enhanced its presence in my body.  This stuff has a great body feeling, light and velvety on the skin, extraordinarily calm and comfortable.  But no psychedelia.  It feels like a tryptamine in the body and mind, but there nothing visually, nothing mentally, it's all on the tactile and emotional level.  I don't have a sense that this state is particularly insightful in any way but it is very pleasant indeed.  
> 
> 
> 
> **5:30pm *(T+1:45)*** - At this point I stopped taking notes beyond a few scribbles.  I began cooking dinner, a nice chicken rice pilaf I've made a handful of times.  As I began cooking, my mind started to really wander.  I soon found myself thinking about my parents.  My dad has ALS and it is very advanced, he probably doesn't have much longer left.  It's unbelievably tragic for many reasons, but the one I thought about today was that my parents were best friends and so in love, but my mom is my dad's full-time caregiver and has been for 6 years now, and it's drastically changed their relationship.  I began by thinking about the situation in general.  The usual wash of painful grief was muted, distanced.  Instead I felt a sense of wistful love and an unafraid mindset, touching on whatever aspects of it that I felt, without any desire to insulate myself.  I moved on to thinking about being my mom through this process.  I often feel some amount of anger towards her for some of the ways in which she has not handled this well and taken it out on my dad.  I imagined the evolution of my mom's world as he slowly regressed into a fully paralyzed and helpless human plagued by constant anxiety and depression, where before he had been the strong one, the provider, the emotional rock.  I imagined the great pain, inconceivable, unthinkable.  I imagine conversing with my mom about her process, after my dad dies, which was insightful and interesting.  I felt my heart reach out to this imagined version of her and attempt to let her know it understands.  I thought briefly about how it would make me feel if my love were to succumb to such a thing and I felt a sharp spike of hurt in my chest, but the spike was tempered by a euphoric sense of love and so was entirely bearable.

> 
> 
> Next, I began thinking about what it was like for my dad, the absolute horror of it, the sadness and hopelessness of becoming a vegetable.  I have had all of these thoughts before, of course.  This was nothing new.  But it was remarkable how I was able to face them without being overwhelmed by pain, though.  What was also noteworthy was that, despite being remarkable, it didn't have a big impact on me beyond the moment.  My thoughts were quick and significant and full of emotional content, but it was almost as if I was just reviewing stuff I already knew.  I was thinking through things and framing them in an idealized fashion almost, and then moving on, and not really resonating with it much beyond the moment.  This review of personal information felt wonderful and warm and loving, and quite euphoric, but it wasn't anything that stuck with me in a particularly powerful way.

> **5:45pm *(T+2:00)*** - I am lost in a long, winding train of thought, which I realize has a soundtrack associated with it.  There are songs playing, so vividly that I can almost hear them audibly.  It isn't music I've invented, as is typically the case.  Instead it is songs I know by others, songs I love and that mean something to me, and that are generally applicable to my current thought process, or in some cases, that cause my current thought process to shift to memories that I associate with those songs.  Typically when I'm having such robust and interesting trains of thought, and I'm actively trying to take notes for a trip, I feel compelled to communicate these ideas, sometimes to the detriment of the trip itself.  Also, typically on empathogenic substances, I want to talk, talk, talk.  However this internal experience feels very personal and communicating it feels like a chore.  Hence I just take brief notes from time to time, which interrupts my thinking, and I let my girlfriend sit on the couch and read without desiring to talk to her about it, either.

> Cooking is fun, I feel slightly scattered but I am also feeling a great sense of accomplishment as I perform all of the steps necessary to produce days worth of meals for myself.  Sustenance is such an important thing, and the enjoyment of food is an amazing part of being human.  I'm lucky in that not only do I enjoy eating, but I enjoy making food, as well.  There's nothing I'd rather be doing right now. 
>

> 
> **6:30pm *(T+2:45)*** - Still going strong.  Suddenly the song "Wonderful Tonight" by Eric Clapton comes into my head, and it triggers a cascade of thoughts of my ex.  Our final divorce court date, where the court decides how much of my stuff I have to give her and whether I am going to be forced to sell my house, is in less than a week.  It has been causing me all manner of anger and pain and confusion, and kicking up a lot of trauma.  She was very emotionally abusive to me over the course of over a decade, and as the divorce process is coming to a head, I've been realizing how traumatized I really am by it, in the way I react to various situations in my relationship and even in my friendships.  In some ways it's the most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with; I had created peace with her and myself after we split, when our relationship seemed to be amicable, and I did not feel damaged by her.  The way she played me for 5 years after we split, to get me to serve her with papers and try to implode my life, while pretending to not want anything from me, and seemingly re-frame our relationship in her eyes to *her* being *my* victim, has filled me with with a poisonous hatred for her that I have never encountered before towards anyone.  It's been really hard for me to deal with, and very toxic to my life.
> 
> 
> 
> The thing is, "Wonderful Tonight" reminded me of the early days, when there was still the beginnings of abuse, yes, but the vast majority of the relationship was good.  It was our song, and hearing it (in my mind) brought back a flood of good memories.  I remembered the intense, head-over-heels feeling of love we had.  I remembered a thousand great moments, tender moments, supportive moments, my mindset that I was so happy to have found my life partner.  We were great friends, back then, and there was a lot of passion.  I have come across these thoughts at various times since I started hating her more recently, of course, but every time I have, I have rebelled against them and they've given me this sick feeling, where I turn back on myself, almost like I'm betraying myself for remembering these aspects of our relationship, untainted by the horrific events that would follow many years later, and the double betrayal of how she has handled things since the split.  4-MeO-MiPT gave me what I can tentatively now, the next day, call a blessing, in that it allowed me to remember those moments, remember that she has a good side, that she didn't mean for this to happen.  To remember that she is mentally ill and that there was a time where she made me really happy, mostly.  She is a human, not a monster.  She deserves my pity, not my hatred.  Today, after the effects of the substance have left me, I still feel that my hatred has been mediated.  I feel cautious about dwelling too much on it, but my internal dialogue about the whole situation feels improved.  This is the only realization that has really stuck with me from this experience, but it is an important and powerful one.
> 
> 
> 
> **7:00pm *(T+3:15)*** - The food is finally done, and eating is so good, I am thoroughly enjoying it.  The body high is a little bit less intense, but mentally, I am as active as ever, even perhaps moreso.  In this way it reminds me of 5-MeO-MiPT, where the first stage is more empathogenic and the second stage is more psychedelic.  I still wouldn't call this psychedelic, but it has become very mentally active and insightfully introspective.  All I want to do is experience things and think.  I don't feel antisocial, but I don't feel particularly social, either.  This is a very internal experience.  It feels special, but private.  I have a continuous and robust internal narrative, but little desire to communicate it.  However, my thoughts at some point turn to my girlfriend, who is sitting across the room on the couch, reading her book, it is a book in a fantastic series we are both reading, and I am one ahead of her, so it's the one I just finished.  It's one of the many things that we share that I really like.  I'm overcome with feelings of love and tenderness towards her, and I walk across the room and sit next to her and give her a hug and kiss and I tell her how much I like her.  It's something we do, we tell each other we love each other when the mood strikes but it almost means more to say how much we like each other, since love and like are not always mutually exclusive and it's true, I just *like* her a whole lot.  She beams and it makes me feel wonderful, because I know it makes her feel wonderful.

> For the rest of the night I just read my book, and become thoroughly engrossed.  It is an absolutely gorgeous story spanning 6 volumes, and I'm on the last one.  It's told in the first-person perspective and the characters are utterly real and noble and lovable to me.  The story is about love in all its forms and the portrayal of the central love stories is profoundly beautiful, as well as the portrayal of parent/child love (both adopted and blood) and friendship is poignant and probably more well-done than I have ever read before in any other books.  Also the portrayal of the love, desire, and closeness of the act of love is profound and beautiful.  My girl and I both read the same story, in slightly different parts, for the rest of the night, and it was profoundly satisfying.  We occasionally stopped and talked and snuggled.  I would say around 8:45 (T+5:00), I felt pretty much normal, though I had an afterglow, which still persists the next morning, just a warm, content feeling of peace.

> I fell asleep reading at 12:30, which was T+8:45, but I could have fallen asleep much earlier if I had tried, and in fact I was trying not to close my eyes and keep reading for about an hour before I fell asleep.  In the morning I awoke with a great afterglow, a feeling of tranquility and peace.  My girlfriend and I ended up exploring the erotic for almost 2 hours once she woke up (later than me), which was immensely satisfying.  I think it's safe to say there was some residual pro-erotic effect going on.

> So, all in all, I was very pleased with 4-MeO-MiPT.  It has similarities to 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT.  It reminded me the most of the 5-MeO, in the headspace, but it was less psychedelic and more empathogenic, and not stimulating really at all, and also there was no come-up to speak of, just a quickly-felt euphoria that only grew and grew, without the slightest discomfort (whereas 5-MeO-MiPT has a very intense come-up that is mostly unpleasant, for me).  It reminded me a lot of the jovial state of post-peak in 4-HO-MiPT, except much less "silly" and more grounded.  Despite these similarities, it is distinctly unique and fits a different role, that of a care-free empathogenic substance that bears no negative side effects and doesn't drain you afterwards.  There were similarities to MDMA but it was much more sober-minded and less intense by far, and less focused outward.  It was nothing earth-shattering, but I am still glowing from it the next day, and it produced some useful, powerful insights about one topic, at least, even though primarily it was just recreational.  It was a trip through the concept of love, and it left me feeling warm and sated.  I liked it enough that I decided to drop a chunk of change on a gram, because I would like to have it available to me for a long time and I only have a couple more doses at the moment, and it's nearly sold out in the places it's being offered, and given its apparent lack of popularity, I doubt it will be made again.  
>

> 
> **Summary:**  About 4-5 hours of effect, a rapid rise to a euphoric and empathogenic peak, which begins around 45 minutes in and reaches the best blend of empathy and introspection around 2 hours in, and then starts dropping off in intensity, but with an increasingly introspective state of mind.  Warm, no sharp edges at all, pleasant, wholesome-feeling.  An underrated gem, in my book, at least from this one trial.  I fully intend on using it again in situations when I want to have a good introspection session but the subject matter is difficult, or when I just want to have a nice, relaxing and euphoric evening of recreation.  I am extremely curious now as to what 4-MeO-DMT would be like!

Wow, great report - thanks for sharing! I notice some similarities between our accounts, particularly in the drive of the experience being mostly introspective. What do you call a material that creates a feeling of warmth towards self and others, and a fearlessness in gazing at one's own inner life? I'd say an empathogen, but every empathogen I've ever come across also has a strong outer push towards extroversion and socialization, while this lent itself towards inner exploration. I felt warm and loving towards others, but my experience was an inner one, a personal one that I felt no push to externalize or document in any way. It was also just so comfortable, something that I've only ever felt from EPT and its substitutions, although the character of the comfort felt different. 


I'm wildly curious about 4-MeO-DMT now, too.

This substance sounds like it could be a good alternative for me than taking MDMA. I've been dealing with a blood pressure issue, given that its elevated i would rather stay away from stimulants as much as possible. This sounds like the perfect compound for a day off work spent in the house alone. More than likely listening to some of my favorite albums or concerts and reading.


If i saw this one available id snatch it, Tryptamines are very friendly with my body chemistry. The majority of the time i trip these days its with them. Though i have made an exception being Mescaline. Even if that one gets stimulating the cactus feels comforting and loving, once you move past the come-up it's bliss.


Pretty much im looking for safe alternatives to MDMA. From what ive read in this thread 4-MeO-MiPT may be a wonderful psychedelic for me to explore.

It does have similarities to MDMA, at least in this one trial I've had so far.  But without any amount of rush or dopaminergic effects.  Also, while I didn't feel specifically introverted, it was a very internal experience and I had little desire to communicate.  On the other hand, it was much more clear-headed than MDMA, and there was absolutely no comedown or negative aftereffects or increase in heart rate or anything objectionable at all.  It was much less intense than MDMA, and less magical-feeling, but highly enjoyable and the effects were not totally dissimilar.

I'm pretty sure I heard a few months ago that there's a vendor selling 4-MeO-DMT. I don't have much interest in trying it because 4-MeO-MiPT didn't do much for me even with 50mg, but I am a little curious to hear what people have to say about it. There is one 4-MeO-DMT report on Erowid but I have a feeling they actually took a different substance.

Okay wow, if so I hope I come across it.  I'm really curious about the 4-MeO tryptamines now, just because 4-MeO-MiPT seems pretty unique and I'm really curious what the generally heavier/more intensely psychedelic DMT version will differ from its other DMT cousins if a methoxy is put on the 4 position.

Xorkoth and I have. Xorkoth liked it quite a bit, while I'm still not sure what to make of it. For me, it's like all the warm fuzzy cozy good vibes somatically and emotionally as the other MiPTs, but with an inward rate than outward focus. And it's also not psychedelic. I don't know what it is. Comfort promoting? An ease-ogen? Keep meaning to revisit it when I'm hungover or something, but haven't. Also want to try vaping it, but haven't done that either.


We've both got trip reports on here that I should probably link to here

Very interesting to me how a few members have described 4-MeO-MiPT and other chemicals (4hoDiPT) as not (very) psychedelic. 


I think someone described it as affecting the mind but not very mental which seemed like a contradiction, but later explained it was affecting emotions but not the mental? aspects of the mind. I can’t find the quote (Edit: I pasted it below) and I can’t quite grasp it, but it’s interesting to consider where you draw the line for “psychedelic” vs. “not” and although it’s been said that 4MeOMiPT is not visual, I know you seasoned members are not simply equating visuals to psychedelic


> But no psychedelia. It feels like a tryptamine in the body and mind, but there nothing visually, nothing mentally, it's all on the tactile and emotional level.
> 		
> Click to expand...
 If something feels like a tryptamine in the mind, how is there “nothing mentally?”

How do you define mental?

Sounds like you mean it has an emotional feel but doesn’t affect your thought patterns. But you had the insights/review into your mom and dad that was almost free of emotion - isn’t that a mental affect and therefore “mind manifesting” aka psychedelic?


Not trying to criticize or argue, just seeking to understand the difference you mean between mind and mental

I guess I just meant there was no classic psychedelic mental effects, it was more like an empathogen.  It felt like at no dose would it even approach ego dissolution.  I felt sober-headed, I could function and socialize normally.  I could have worked if I'd wanted to.  It was characterized by an emotional warmth, but not outwardly directed, more like I thought a lot about myself and people I know and was able to confront things in a peaceful and non-judgmental way.  I felt very comfortable and at peace.  There were no visual distortions whatsoever either.  But in the body I felt a tryptamine sort of electric fuzzy feeling.  I didn't mean to suggest it has no mental effects or is not at all mind manifesting, just that it is mind manifesting in a way that is closer to an empathogen.

My questions come from an inability to describe and categorize my own experience with different substances.  I’ve also had zero experience with empathogens other than 2cb if that kinda counts. Of course I can imagine the effects after years of reading, but I’ve tended to stick to psychedelics for my preferred substances.


I feel like I was better at describing all the nuances when I was tripping more frequently. Now that I’ve had more trips overall but they are stretched out farther between, I have a hard time describing even in my own mind the differences between 2ce that I took 9 years ago, a sprinkling of tryptamines, and LSD that can lead to such varied trips itself!  I remember once on LSD with my brother, showing him how I was so *connected* and could ride my bike with no hands...”but would I want to see my boss right now?  No!”

So I get your distinction of being able to think about work. Or rather not being quite able to do so while tripping with the classic mental effects.  On my most recent lsd trip I found myself kinda restless and not knowing what to do with myself and I considered doing some work on the computer, like DNA primer design or something pretty routine that I would be sure to double check later.  I decided not to “waste” my time, but I think I could have - though that was after the peak and on prob 150 ug max.


I’ve been reading through all the 4-ho-tryptamine big and dandies - I realize this is a tangent with the methoxy - and while trying to decide if any seem as worthwhile as I find 4-ho-mipt...I don’t really understand exactly what it is that I like so much about it.


Excuse the rambling, I’m definitely derailing the thread ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No it's interesting and I think relevant to the topic.  I agree 4-MeO-MiPT is particularly hard to characterize.  I need to try it again, I have most of a gram, but have only tried it twice.  I am curious whether I keep getting consistent effects or if a variety of effects will manifest.

I actually thought about trying it earlier today. My whole body was sore and could've done with some somatic comforting.


As to porkstock's question, that's a bit too much to get into without a keyboard. I will say that there are plenty of non-visual psychedelics (5-MeO-MiPT and 2C-B-FLY are non visual for lots of folks.) To me, this seemed like a non-visual non-psychedelic.


As for developing a more granular language for classes of subjective drug experiences, well that's a job for poets and linguistic phenomenologists. And us.

Heh.. "non visual moon psychedelic"?? Wtf is a moon psychedelic???


I never had much interest in any 4-meo-tryptamine until recently. [@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) TR makes this seem worthwhile.


[@Pfafffed](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/369391/)  please link your TR?


I won't go too far in depth, but the 4-meo-tryptamines can be accessed via 1,3-cyclohexanedione and 4-meo-tryptamine itself can be used as a starting point to the most well known kratom alkaloid mitragynine...

Ha, I puzzled over that for a minute too. I think he meant 4-MeO-MiPT is a non-visual non-psychedelic.  Blame it on the lack of a keyboard like he mentioned

Here we have a common problem with aesthetics. How do you describe something that is a subjective experience to someone that hasn't shared it? You find the closest frame of reference. When Xorkoth describes something as being "psychedelic," I believe he is envisioning a package of traits shared by his experiences with the several dozen drugs that are commonly classed as psychedelic. I have a similar frame of reference and am assuming similar traits. For what it's worth, I think both Xorkoth and I have an atypically broad view of qualities that qualify an experience as being "psychedelic." I can't tell you how many people that have taken mushrooms for decades have taken mescaline or 2C-B as "not psychedelic," because the effects aren't recognizable to them as such, say nothing of drugs like DOF!


Yes, this is a terrible non-method for operationalizing a definition. It's just a heuristic that works well enough for my purposes when talking to people that have taken lots of different psychedelics. That said, I haven't yet found it to be particularly useful to try to hammer out precise terms, because the subset of people that can even talk about these things is so small and fragmented that I'd be lucky to find one other person right now to come to a consensus with. Maybe that will change in the next 5-10 years, though--I'm optimistic. There are a bunch of nerds over on the subjective effects discord that are probably working on this right now.


If I were to try to narrow down the scope of what I consider "psychedelic" effects to be, I think we'd quickly end up with a bunch of fairly independent effects.


There are visual distortions.

There are somatic sensations.

There is a change to the embodied sense of self.

There are proprioceptive distortions.

There are changes to coordination.

There are changes to focus, concentration, and multi-tasking.

There is a whole mess of cognitive changes that include linguistic processing, symbol assignment, memories, ontology, significance, and a whole lot more.


What do you do with a drug that has only some of these elements?


How can or should we refer to powerfully visual exerpeiences leaves you feeling otherwise sober like some NBOx?

How about completely non-visual experiences that shred your ego, memory, time perception, identity, and senses like 5-MeO-DMT can?


What I can say about 4-MeO-MiPT is that it did not have any of the core elements that people often associate with psychedelics. It wasn't an ontological solvent. It didn't produce visuals. I felt it in my body, my mind, and my mood, but it was not unique in that. The same can be said of cannabis (is it a psychedelic,) kava kava (is it a psychedelic,) and caffeine (is it a psychedelic?) Sure, 4-MeO-MiPT shared familiar elements with other drugs in the MiPT family, but I don't think that those associations would come across as "psychedelic" for most, especially for those not already familiar with the family. What I will say is that the times I think about taking 4-MeO-MiPT overlap strongly with the times I would consider taking acetaminophen--when I'm in discomfort and want to be soothed.


Thanks for asking--it's an interesting question, and one that I'm often frustrated that I can't answer better.

Appreciate the whole post but my only/immediate comment is that it seems wild that you reach for 4-meo-mipt the same way you reach for Tylenol haha
