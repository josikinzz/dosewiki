## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as benzothiadiazoles. These are heterocyclic aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a thiadiazole ring. Thiadiazole is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle made up of one sulfur atom and two nitrogen atoms.

### Background

Tizanidine is a fast-acting drug used for the management of muscle spasm, which may result from the effects of multiple sclerosis, stroke, an acquired brain injury, or a spinal cord injury
9
.  It may also be caused by musculoskeletal injury
5
.  Regardless of the cause, muscle spasticity can be an extremely painful and debilitating condition.
Initially approved by the FDA in 1996, tizanidine is an Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist reducing spasticity by the presynaptic inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause firing of neurons promoting muscle spasm
Label
.

### Indication

Tizanidine is indicated for the relief of muscle spasticity, which can interfere with daily activities.  The general recommendation is to reserve tizanidine use for periods of time when there is a particular need for relief, as it has a short duration of action
Label
,
11
.

### Pharmacodynamics

A note on spasticity
Spasticity is an increase in muscle accompanied by uncontrolled, repetitive contractions of skeletal muscles which are involuntary.
The patient suffering from muscle spasticity may have reduced mobility and high levels of pain, contributing to poor quality of life and problems performing activities of personal hygiene and care
7
.
General effects
Tizanidine is a rapidly acting drug used for the relief of muscle spasticity when it is required for performing specific activities. It acts as an agonist at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites and relieves symptoms of muscle spasticity, allowing the continuation of normal daily activities. In animal models, tizanidine has not been shown to exert direct effects on skeletal muscle fibers or the neuromuscular junction, and has shown no significant effect on monosynaptic spinal reflexes (consisting of the communication between only 1 sensory neuron and 1 motor neuron)
10
. The frequency of muscle spasm and clonus are shown to be decreased by tizanidine
9
. Tizanidine shows a stronger action on polysynaptic reflexes, which involve several interneurons (relay neurons) communicating with motor neurons stimulating muscle movement
10
.
Effects on blood pressure and heart rate
This drug decreases heart rate and blood pressure in humans
4
,
6
.  Despite this, rebound hypertension and tachycardia along with increased spasticity can occur when tizanidine is abruptly discontinued
8
.

### Mechanism of Action

Agonist
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors
Agonist

### Absorption

This drug undergoes significant first-pass metabolism. After the administration of an oral dose, tizanidine is mostly absorbed. The absolute oral bioavailability of tizanidine is measured to be about 40%
Label
.
Effect of food on absorption
Food has been shown to increase absorption for both the tablets and capsules. The increase in absorption with the tablet (about 30%) was noticeably higher than the capsule (~10%). When the capsule and tablet were administered with food, the amount absorbed from the capsule was about 80% of the amount absorbed from the tablet
Label
. It is therefore advisable to take this drug with food for increased absorption, especially in tablet form.

### Metabolism

About 95% of the ingested dose of tizanidine is metabolized. The main enzyme involved in the hepatic metabolism of tizanidine is CYP1A2

### Half-life

Approximately 2.5 hours

.

### Toxicity

LD50 information
Oral LD50 (rat): 414 mg/kg; Subcutaneous LD50 (rat): 282 mg/kg; Oral LD50 (mouse): 235 mg/kg
MSDS
Use in pregnancy
Animal studies have determined that this drug causes fetal harm
Label
. Studies have not been performed in humans, and it is advisable to ensure that tizanidine use in pregnant women should be reserved for cases in which possible benefit clearly outweighs the possible risk to mother and unborn child
11
.
Use in breastfeeding
In studies of rat models, this tizanidine was found excreted in the breastmilk with a milk-to-blood ratio of 1.8:1
Label
. In young nursing rats, abnormal results were obtained in tests indicative of central nervous system function. Various developmental changes that may have been attributable to the drug were observed.  It is unknown whether tizanidine is excreted in human milk. It is a lipid-soluble drug, however, and likely to be excreted into breast milk
11
.
Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis
No signs of carcinogenicity were observed in two dietary studies performed in rodent models. Tizanidine was given to mice for 78 weeks at doses reaching a maximum 16 mg/kg (equivalent to twice the maximum recommended human dose). In addition, the drug was given to rats for 104 weeks at doses reaching 9 mg/kg (equivalent to 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose). There was a lack of a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of tumors in either study group
11
.
Tizanidine was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in several laboratory essays, including the bacterial Ames test, the mammalian gene mutation test, in addition to the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster cells and several other assays
11
.

### Mechanism of action

Tizanidine reduces spasticity by causing presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons via agonist actions at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sites.
This drug is centrally acting and leads to a reduction in the release of excitatory amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, which cause neuronal firing that leads to muscle spasm. The above reduction and excitatory neurotransmitter release results in presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The strongest effect of tizanidine has been shown to occur on spinal polysynaptic pathways.   The anti-nociceptive and anticonvulsant activities of tizanidine may also be attributed to agonist action on Alpha-2 receptors.  Tizanidine also binds with weaker affinity to the Alpha-1 receptors, explaining its slight and temporary effect on the cardiovascular system

Label
.

### Clearance

A note on renal impairment
Tizanidine clearance is found to be decreased by more than 50% in elderly patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 25 mL/min) 
compared to healthy elderly subjects; this would be expected to lead to a longer duration of clinical effect. This drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of various endogenous substrates, including fatty acids, steroid hormones and vitamins (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:10681376, PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:9435160). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Exhibits high catalytic activity for the formation of hydroxyestrogens from estrone (E1) and 17beta-estradiol (E2), namely 2-hydroxy E1 and E2 (PubMed:11555828, PubMed:12865317). Metabolizes cholesterol toward 25-hydroxycholesterol, a physiological regulator of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (PubMed:21576599). May act as a major enzyme for all-trans retinoic acid biosynthesis in the liver. Catalyzes two successive oxidative transformation of all-trans retinol to all-trans retinal and then to the active form all-trans retinoic acid (PubMed:10681376). Primarily catalyzes stereoselective epoxidation of the last double bond of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), displaying a strong preference for the (R,S) stereoisomer (PubMed:19965576). Catalyzes bisallylic hydroxylation and omega-1 hydroxylation of PUFA (PubMed:9435160). May also participate in eicosanoids metabolism by converting hydroperoxide species into oxo metabolites (lipoxygenase-like reaction, NADPH-independent) (PubMed:21068195). Plays a role in the oxidative metabolism of xenobiotics. Catalyzes the N-hydroxylation of heterocyclic amines and the O-deethylation of phenacetin (PubMed:14725854). Metabolizes caffeine via N3-demethylation (Probable)
