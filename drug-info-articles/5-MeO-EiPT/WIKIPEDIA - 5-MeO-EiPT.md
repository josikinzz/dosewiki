5-MeO-EiPT, also known as 5-methoxy-N-ethyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine family which has been sold online as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

5-MeO-EiPT was not included or mentioned in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). When subsequently asked about 5-MeO-EiPT, Shulgin said that he never got around to making or exploring it and that its dose, duration, and effects were unknown. In any case, 5-MeO-EiPT has been used as a novel recreational designer drug.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

5-MeO-EiPT acts as a potent full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It also shows high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and interacts very weakly with the serotonin transporter (SERT). The drug produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. However, it produces a rather weak head-twitch response, suggesting that it might have reduced hallucinogenic effects relative to other psychedelic tryptamines or might be non-hallucinogenic. The serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 augmented the head-twitch response induced by 5-MeO-EiPT in rodents. The drug also produces hypothermia and hypolocomotion in rodents.
