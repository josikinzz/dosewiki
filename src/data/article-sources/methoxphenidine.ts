**Methoxphenidine** (**MXP**) or **1-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethyl]piperidine** is a hallucinogenic dissociative compound of the piperdine chemical class. It has similar effects to that of the arylcyclohexylamine and morphinan classes of dissociatives.

It induces a state referred to as “dissociative anesthesia” and is used as a recreational drug. Very little is known about this substance but it has recently become freely available through online research chemical vendors where it is being sold as a designer drug and marketed as a replacement for MXE despite many users reporting it as qualitatively different in its effects and closer to that of DXM. It has yet to be studied within humans in any formal context.

In terms of its chemistry, MXP is classed as a piperdine drug. The piperdine molecule in MXP is attached to a benzene group via two carbon atoms on one side and a methoxybenzene molecule attached to one carbon on the other side. It is usually produced in its freebase form, which is insoluble in water. When consumed orally, the molecule is converted to the hydrochloride salt in the stomach. The HCl salt is reported to raise blood pressure, and peak effects are felt around 2 hours in, whereas the citrate salt has been observed to peak at around 30 minutes with less blood pressure concern. This is the same principal as DXM which is more potent in its citrate salt.

As for its pharmacology, MXP has antagonistic action on NMDA receptors, which leads to anaesthetic and dissociative effects. Although it has not been formally studied, the feelings of physical and emotional euphoria which many users report suggests that it may also have action as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.

The MXP experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.

**Physical effects:**

The subjective physical effects of MXP are most similar to that of DXM than any other commonly used dissociative. They can be broken down into seven components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Disconnection from tactile input** - this results in typical states of progressive physical disconnection but is far more consciously controllable than that of other dissociatives. This allows one to choose how much of their body they are currently aware of and connected to simply by directing their focus towards it even throughout higher states of disconnection and out of body experiences.
- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - the MXP body high is a soft, pleasurable vibrating sensation. It can be felt all over the body and progressively intensifies throughout the onset before dissipating once the peak has been reached.
- **Suppression of touch** - this partially to entirely suppresses one’s own sense of touch, creating feelings of numbness within the extremities. It is responsible for the anaesthetic properties of this substance.
- **Physical autonomy**
- **Loss of motor control** - a loss of gross and fine motor control alongside of balance and coordination is prevalent within MXP and becomes especially strong at higher dosages. This means that one should be sitting down before the onset unless they are experienced in case of falling over and injuring oneself.
- **Euphoria** - this results in feelings of physical euphoria which range between mild pleasure to powerful all encompassing bliss.
- **Decreased bodily weight** - this creates the sensation that the body is floating and has become entirely weightless. This effect is strangely stimulating and encourages physical activities at low - moderate dosages by making the body feel light and effortless to move.
- **Dizziness**

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of MXP is often described as particularly clear headed even at heavy dosages. It is far more controllable, less disorientating and confusing at dosages of equal subjective intensity to that of MXE, DXM and Ketamine. The cognitive effects of MXP can be broken down into 6 separate subcomponents which are listed and described below:

- **Disconnection from consciousness**
- **Acceleration of thought**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Time distortion** - feelings of time dilation and more time having passed than it actually has are common at moderate to strong dosages.
- **Euphoria**
- **Conceptual thinking**

**Visual effects:**

The visual effects of MXP are unique in comparison to other dissociatives as they do not include open eye visual suppression, geometry or distortions but still remain very powerful at appropriate dosages. The present effects progressively intensify according to dosage and commonly include:

- **Disconnection from visual input** - this eventually results in the MXP’s equivalent of the famous “K-hole” or more specifically, holes, spaces and voids alongside of level 1 - 4 structures. In comparison to other substances, this effect is unique however as it is far more consciously controllable than that of other dissociatives. It allows one to choose how disconnected they currently are by simply directing their focus towards the external environment even throughout higher states of disconnection and out of body experiences.
- **Internal hallucinations** - these hallucinatory states can be described as dream like in nature while often containing imagery, landscapes, plots, settings, autonomous entity contact and scenarios. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, mostly unimmersive in style and extremely controllable in their content in a way which allows one to choose what they wish to see.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of MXP are common in their occurrence but unlike other more commonly used dissociatives, they are unlikely to suppress or distort auditory input and exhibit a small range of effects which exclusively includes:

- **Enhancements**

**Afterglow:**

The afterglow is a feeling that occurs within the 24 hours after the trip itself. It is long lasting and as equally enjoyable as the trip itself to many people. It can be be described in terms of its physical sensation as one of euphoria, rejuvenation, relaxation and a light bounciness. In terms of its mental thought processes however, it can be described as a complete loss of anxiety, feelings of contentedness and an extremely high appreciation for music which dissipates within a day or so after the experience.

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational MXP use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because MXP is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried MXP within the community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is a very strong tolerance build up with MXP which results in the need to consume increasingly large doses in order to achieve the same level of effects. This should reset to baseline after 1 - 2 weeks. There may well be some addictive potential but this is still unknown.

Tolerance may be mitigated via preparing the citrate salt by mixing the chemical with citric acid or lemon juice, which will aid in absorption and increase effects.

**Legal Issues:**

MXP is currently a legal grey area world wide and freely available through the use of online research chemical vendors. This does not mean that you are guaranteed to be immune from legal prosecution should you be found in possession of this substance as it is likely to vary from country to country.

**Conclusion:**

This new dissociative is an extremely novel, capable and interesting compound. The potential negative effects are currently unknown so tread carefully and start with light dosages if you are so inclined.

## Subjective Experience

First referenced in a 1989 patent, MXP appeared on the recreational markets at the
end of 2013, and became widely available during the following year.

My first experience with this chemical, a couple of years ago, was an early expedition
into this field. I was well immersed, I enjoyed it, and I recorded it as a solid ++ on the
Shulgin scale. However, other than its dissociative weirdness, and that I felt no ill
effects, I recall very little about it.

Fortunately, I still have one old MXP pill of 75mg left in a desk-drawer. A decision is
therefore required: what dose should I choose to re-sample with, given the threshold
data above?

After the allergy test, there is perhaps 70mg remaining. As I recall Internet reports
referring to seizures on high doses, there is an obvious need to proceed with more
caution than usual. Further, the BlueLight forum warns of unpredictability and
inconsistency, and suggests a starting dose of 50mg. I decide to heed this advice.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I break the pill into pieces, separate approximately 50mg, and bomb it
down the hatch with water. [2:45pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I dispose of the rest to prevent redosing under the influence.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 Already I am feeling a sedated headspace, and I dreamily drift off
focus now and again. Whilst onset is commonly suggested to be 30-60
minutes, the odd report refers to two hours, which would put it on a par with
my experiments with ephenidine. However, this has started to take effect
much more quickly than anticipated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 I have now definitely entered the zone. Reality is a little weird, and a
degree of anaesthesia is present. I am warm and comfortable, feeling a mellow
headiness and physical insentience.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 The headiness is pretty solid now, and quite pleasant. The physical
feeling is interesting in that there are occasional tactile sensations amidst the
overall numbing effect. Time is passing rather quickly. I am already enjoying
it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 As weirdness would have it a David Bowie track rolls in the
background with: “Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by
jingo". I certainly feel that I am tripping gently at this stage, and floating.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 The disconnection is now increasingly strong. I check my blood
pressure: 163/91. It’s quite high but not alarming. My pulse is a normal
53bpm. I am not happy about the former, but in the interest of not increasing
it further via stress, I choose to navigate my mind away from it rather than
dwell upon it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I take the experience into a more relaxing realm by playing some YouTube
videos and reading.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 Shock horror: a phone call! This takes me by surprise and I make the
mistake of picking up the handset. The real world interjects and I desperately
attempt to act like a normal human being. I engage a conversation to the best
of my ability with the lady on the other end, but with difficulty. I believe that I
am rational and lucid, but I am far from certain. I think the acronym I am
looking for here is OMG.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With this trauma over, I try to put it behind me and settle back down into the
experience.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+2:00 I now feel that I have reached a plateau. The two hours have flown by.
Although I am still a little haunted by thoughts of the mess I made of that
phone call, I am in a fairly happy place.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am a little chilly and my hands are cold, so there appears to be some
vasoconstriction in play.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:30 I feel a little more grounded, and have probably peaked, but I am still
flying. There is a sense of wonder to everything as I float from one focus of
concentration to another.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:45 I am coming-down. Physically I still have cold and clammy hands, but
mentally I am totally functional if I choose to be.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I can still ride the trip if I want to but step off it if I need to.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:30 Time is still passing quickly. There is still some numbness and
headiness but I am in a much gentler state of dissociation.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I find that I can choose a subject or topic, focus, and then fall into it for a
period, before emerging back into self awareness.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am now very much in control.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I seem to be winding down in the usual manner for a dissociative, but
even at this level, the headspace, body analgesia, and tingles, continue to make
this a gentle floating pleasure.
\`\`\`
For the rest of the evening I drifted slowly but pleasantly down. Despite the bumps
on the road I felt physically well and was able to navigate my mind into positive
directions at will. The 50mg dose was clearly sufficient.

The night can best be described as comprising two deep sleeps of 3-4 hours each. The
first began with chilliness and the need for an extra cover, and ended with a vivid
nightmare. Theorising on the latter, I would speculate that, with the MXP still active
at a low level, the intensification of focus upon subject matter took me deeper into
the story of my dream than usual. This resulted in an extension of the dream beyond
the point at which I would have normally woken, with greater immersion within it. I
suspect that this phenomenon may also manifest across other dissociatives.

Notwithstanding the fact that generally I had a very good experience, research
demonstrates that this is a chemical which clearly carries risks. Erowid, for example,
reports that there have been several deaths associated with its use.

Dose moderation and appropriate caution is strongly advised.

  "wikipedia": `# Methoxphenidine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methoxphenidine*

Methoxphenidine (methoxydiphenidine, 2-MeO-Diphenidine, MXP) is a dissociative of the diarylethylamine class that has been sold online as a designer drug. Methoxphenidine was first reported in a 1989 patent where it was tested as a treatment for neurotoxic injury. Shortly after the 2013 UK ban on arylcyclohexylamines methoxphenidine and the related compound diphenidine became available on the gray market, where it has been encountered as a powder and in tablet form. Though diphenidine possesses higher affinity for the NMDA receptor, anecdotal reports suggest methoxphenidine has greater oral potency. Of the three isomeric anisyl-substituents methoxphenidine has affinity for the NMDA receptor that is higher than 4-MeO-diphenidine but lower than 3-MeO-diphenidine, a structure–activity relationship shared by the arylcyclohexylamines.

## Side effects

Acute methoxphenidine intoxication has been reported to produce confusion, hypertension, and tachycardia that was responsive to treatment with intravenous lorazepam, methoxphenidine has also been associated with three published fatalities and one case of impaired driving.
Psychotic episodes have also been reported, including a murder in June 2014.

## Legal status

As of October 2015 MXP is a controlled substance in China.
MXP is also banned in Sweden.
In Canada, MT-45 and its analogues were made Schedule I controlled substances, which includes DPD in its structural group. Possession without legal authority can result in maximum seven years imprisonment. Further, Health Canada amended the Food and Drug Regulations in May, 2016 to classify explicitly DPD as a restricted drug. Only those with a law enforcement agency, person with an exemption permit or institutions with Minister's authorization may possess the drug.
In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration decided to include methoxphenidine as a Prohibited substance (Schedule 9) within the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons alongside four other phenidine analogs on 1 October 2024.
