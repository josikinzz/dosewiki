It is possible to get away with high doses because the mental component of the trip is mild so it may not feel as intense as other psychedelics even though there are powerful visuals. In order to try and overcome this some users take several doses to get a more intense/spiritual experience. While this does work for some, for others this is where the serious side-effects emerge.

I was actually thinking about making a thread asking if there was a thread on this. I will have the chance to test it out soon and am fairly excited. I think I only read one report on it? Can't even remember properly. What would everyones thoughts on a proper starter dose would be? The only reference i've even seen is the Wiki article that states its active at 400-650 ug insufflated. Also the lone TR. Many people were discussing using the new HPBC method of administering the NBOMe's a poster on here has been studying. Any thoughts on this? Hope to see this thread get some posts going!

I wouldn't start with more than 100-200µg just to be safe, as there's next to no info on this at all.  I'd imagine potency will be similar to the other halogenated 25x-NBOMe's though.

As far as the complexation of nbome's with hydroxy-propyl-beta-cyclodextrin, I am certain that when complexed, you go from 50% to 95% buccal absorption in my experience. 95% absorption of hydrophobic drugs complexed to HPBCD has been reported in studies by Dr. Joseph Pitha on sublingually applied HPBCD-complexed testosterone (quite hydrophobic just like the nbome molecules) whereas normally, only 40% or so absorption of testosterone base powder is achieved without complexation, HPBCD complexation causes quite a dramatic jump in absorption and effectiveness in 20 minutes time. Studies can be found on-line and in the links I give in the big and dandy 25c thread. 


Have posted instructions on how this is done in the big and dandy 25c-nbome thread and also the small and fancy 25i-nbome thread. In  my experience, HPBCD complexed nbome applied to upper gum in the form of a 1.75" x 5/16" wide filter paper strip (the rectangle blotter cut from #103 filter paper) does indeed achieve the exact same potency as the same amount applied nasally, so yes, buccally applied HPBCD-complexed nbome is equipotent to non-complexed nasally applied nbome. I've seen the "beta-cyclodextrin" version of this stuff on auction sites, but perhaps maybe someday, someone will offer the hydroxy-propyl version of this. It's possible that beta-cyclodextrin would work just about as well as hydroxy-propyl-beta-cyclodextrin but I have no idea as I only use the hydroxy-propyl version. Swim got his HPBCD powder many years ago from a sports company that went out of business shortly after the pro-hormone ban of the Bush years. There are actually a couple places (outside of auction sites ) that directly have Hydroxypropyl Beta Cyclodextrin. In any case, there are hundreds of research papers on the science of HPBCD, "Trappsol" and other fancy sounding brand names are currently used for the stuff these days it seems.


How long/well does HPBCD store? Apparently very well, after almost 7 years, the HPBCD was stored in the original plastic screw lid container it came in, still as good/fresh as the day it was opened. No special storage conditions needed, just keep in a cool dark & dry place at room temperature.

Yeah I figured that would be a good area. With so little data and mainly guesses I was even thinking 50 mcg. I'll probably just wait it out for another to test first so I don't ruin my receptors for a week or so. 


I am very glad to hear you believe buccal vs insufflation to be nearly identical in potency. I would have to assume this is just an educated guess though correct? It does however seem to be pretty accurate. I will test this for myself when I receive 25B and HPBCD. I also noticed many popular auction sites had BCD. Its BA is ridiculously lowered compared to HPBCD according to the internet. There are a few places where HPBCD can be acquired today though so no worries. Fairly excited to try it out and see how well it really works.

Thanks for the comments Help?!?!. Yes, that's very true, there are a few places where HPBCD can be gotten directly with a little searching with no hassles, as for example the "sports supplements" companies are able to get it no problems.  I quoted the general research paper from Joseph Pitha in the 25c-nbome big and dandy thread on the 95% absorption of sublingual testosterone base in 20 minutes. Testosterone is extremely hydrophobic with a solubility in water of something like 0.039mg per ml, practically in-soluble, however, when complexed to HPBCD, it becomes 100% water soluble. Guess what else is very hydrophobic (water-fearing)?, yes, that's right the nbome's, especially 25i-nbome. HPBCD can be thought of as like a "molecular condomn" that traps drug molecules in it's donut-shaped hole so that they can be delivered directly to surfaces of the mucosal cavities in the mouth with high effectiveness. At last, there is a healthy role for sugar molecules to play other than destroying our health and well-being my contributing to diabetes and sugar/glucose regulation problems, fat storage, insulin surges, etc, LOL. Yes, the HPBCD-complexed molecule is so effective bucally that I will never use nasal methods again, it works that well imho. 


> 1. Water

> HPBCD is very soluble in water. Substitution of the hydroxyl groups of the BCD disrupts the network of hydrogen bonding around the rim of the BCD. As a result of disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network, the hydroxyl groups interact much more strongly with water resulting in increased solubility compared to BCD. Solubilities of HPBCD are typically listed at >60% at amnbient temperature. As the concentraion becomes higher, viscosity begins to increase and solubility determinations become difficult to perform due to slow filtration rates and at very high solids levels, slow dissolution because of high viscosities making mixing difficult.

In most cases, only one molecule is included in the cavity of HPBCD. In the case of some low molecular weight guests, more than one molecule of guest might fit into the cavity. In the case of some high molecular weight molecules, more than one molecule of cyclodextrin might bind to the guest. Only a portion of the molecule must fit into the cavity to form a complex. As a result, a one-to-one molar ratio is not always achieved, especially with high or low molecular weight guests and some prelimiary complex formation and analysis is needed to determine relative amounts of cyclodextrin and guest to be added for complexation.


Hydroxyproply Beta Cyclodextrin (HPCD) (CAS #94035-02-6) is a partially substituted poly (hydroxypropyl) ether of beta cyclodextrin (BCD). The empiracal formula is: (C42 H70-n035). (C3 H7 O)n it contains not less than 10.0 percent and not more than 45.0 percent hydroxypropoxy(-OCH2CHOHCH3) groups. The structure is shown below where

R represents either hydrogen or a hydroxypropoxy group.


R=CH2CH(OH)CH3 or H


The solubility of HPBCD is quite high, exceeding 600mg/ml in water, and exceeding 225mg/ml in 95% etoh. Viscosity is not an issue in concentrations below 55%


The molecular weight of HPBCD is 1375.36


The molecular weight of NBome-2c-I is 427.277


The molecular weight of testosterone is 288.42 (95% sublingual absorption achieved in 20 minutes when complexed to HPBCD according to published research (Pitha, Joseph). This figure falls to 50% or less when it is not complexed to HPBCD and applied sublingually over the same 20 minute period.


Dazed (on HPBCD-complexed hormones):


> The conventional penetration enhancers like alcohols or polyethylene glycol act by disrupting the lipid layers of membranes.(3) That is a big source of irritation from the old formula, and this irritation can thus be avoided by the use of CD’s (cyclodextrins). Another advantage is, once administered, the steroid is rapidly absorbed sublingually. Nearly 95% of the steroid will be absorbed within 20 minutes. This also causes the need for multiple doses throughout the day.

I've also had my eye on this for a while and wondered quietly why so little info is available. So, i came across the [Ettrup-paper](http://bitnest.ca/external.php?id=%257DbxUgX%255DCY%2505%2504v%257Fv%2519%2505V%255BL%2503RAq%2560h) which has been mentioned in a few other threads. It looks like 25B-NBOMe is way better at crossing the BBB than 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe (or any of the other drugs tested). Also the binding affinity is better as is the receptor activation. So, I'm guessing that using tregars ROA (nice work btw) the dose should be about half or less than 25I-NBOMe

The doses are in the 200-1000 mcg range like those of the others NBOMes with halogens. Many find 700 mcg to be suitably enough, some claim it is a little too much.


I personally do not like this chem, it is not as rewarding as D or I or C. Just a potent PEA-psychedelic with DOB undertones. It may also have pronounced bodyload. And many people complained about vasoconstriction being too strong for them to like it.

Just had experience with this compound and made this post in the 25I-NBOMe thread not realizing this 25B-NBOMe thread existed.

Oral(with liquid) just doesn't work well for this compound.  2-3mg sublingual dose was very meditating and chill.  Didn't notice much visual.  Tried 4-5mg two days later and there were strong visual effects.  It was much gentler come up than 2c-e in terms of body load n etc.  I know my doses look higher than norm here but again my 25b has impurity of 40-60% dextrose.  Will give it a go again in two weeks and maybe I can write a detailed trip report in the proper section then.

This compound is far superior to 2ce imo/ime.

It was such a euphoric blast

here is some information i acquired


Active from 1mg. Over 4mg it is rather strong.

This works for 5-8h in 1-3mg range over this it can lasts after 8-10h

This dissolves well in ethanol if you want to make blotter

and also well in water if you want to make liquid dropper.

Works sublingual (under tongue)or insufflated (sniff) way.

because the chem is decaying in stomach


Threshold

0,5-1mg  (0,0005-0,001g)

Light

1 - 2 mg

Common

2- 3 mg

Strong

3-5 mg

Heavy

+ 5 mg


**VERY IMPORTANT:**


the agent is 99% pure

but it was cut with **about** 50% dextrose


be careful apparently some 25b-nbome that has been going around has been cut with dextrose "about 50%"...

This information is undoubtedly some kind of error.


I'd repeat if you don't remember: 2C-B-NBOMe is the most common NBOMe-PEA in Russia and is the one that is the most explored. I probably took too much of it as well as DOB before, and I am wery familliar with theirs effects. To the point where I don't know what much to say about them, such 4-bromine substituted PEAs are a sort of archetypycal thing to me. 


2 mg of pure substance is my common dose, 3 mg is a heavy dose. I was able to feel it at 0,1 mg i/m. For the majority of population 0,5 mg is a common dose, 0,7 mg is a strong dose, and 1 mg is a heavy one.

Get an oral syringe without the needle part, for example one that can contain 1 ml. They are sold for giving babies and pets medicine. Then you are able to measure the volume that corresponds to the wanted dose, squirt it in your mouth and hold it under your tongue for as long as you can without swallowing what's in your mouth.

You may also squirt the solution into your nose but be careful to only do this in small parts so that it will not drip down the back of your sinuses into your throat because it is then again swallowed and basically lost since it does not work well (or hardly if at all) orally. Better to do small bits of liquid and give it a few minutes to absorb before putting in more than doing too much at once. Also check the 25C-NBOMe thread for example where people describe the volume a typical nose can tolerate without getting an excess that drips.

Squirting it up your a-hole is also an option but often not considered acceptable. I myself have plugged 2C-B in the past with success but on the other hand don't particularly feel enthoused about it. But I'm obviously not prude about it either.


So there you go, a number of options actually.


Also, if you are unable to get syringes but do have access to a scale and small vials or mini containers for holding small volumes of liquid you can weigh your solution since if it is water it will be almost exactly 1 g per 1 ml (to be exact 1.01 g if there were no cuts).


*Remember! This is a very potent and relatively not well researched compound so don't start at a full active dose but test with a fraction of it first and slowly build your way up. Experiment as responsibly as you can!*


Regarding the 50% dextrose cut, that sounds pretty silly. I cut my 25X-NBX compounds with mannitol myself so I actually find it a fine idea, but I use ratios like 1:40 or 1:50 because that has actual purpose. 50% is bullshit right?


P.S. about krokodil even though it seems like it was a joke or sarcasm the drug itself actually doesn't seem bad at all to me. I'm even interested in making a little for myself using a proper way instead of the unsafe methods street junkies use. Because the impurities / toxic reagents from those bad methods are actually what cause the horrible problems. Just fyi let's not forget that.

So if its cut with 50% dextrose would that interfere with a complexing agent?


Also what would be the expected metabolic fate of the N-(2-MeO)-benzyl moiety?

25B is an interesting substance. Prior to this I have only been familiar with the archetypal psychedelics so I am unable to give a comparative analysis against other rc's in this class. I worked up my dosage in 500ug increments over the course of several hours begining with 500ug and ending with 3mg. I believe my material has been diluted by the supplier in order to make dosage calculation easier but I have no honest idea what the percentage of dilution is. They claim their purity is 99.98% but this doesn't take in to account any fillers that were used. My dosage was in accordance to manufacturers recomendation and seems to be correct for the effects they described. !!!WARNING: If someone else obtains this substance they MUST work up their own dosage and not use my dosage as a referance point!!! Visually this substance is akin to indole tryptamines like psilocybin. I'm not going to give my experience any Shulgin + rating because I never used that to describe my experiences before I knew who Shulgin was and I see no reason to start now. 3mg(?) of 25B feels like 3gr of dried mushroom or 100ug of LSD to me. Mental clarity is good and doesn't have the confused looping of mushrooms but it doesn't have the crystal clarity and insight of LSD either. Overall I would say there is no change in my thought patterns, the substance at this level of dose is mostly visual with some physical effects like increased body temperature and slight digital tremor, both of which are normal for me with LSD and neither seem to be worrisome with 25B at this dosage. No vasoconstriction has been noted at this dose. My bowles feel a bit loose but that may just be the 7-11 burrito I had earlier and not be related to this substance. All in all I would say there is nothing remarkable about 25B other than the fact that it is legal and people are giving away free samples over the internet. It's a brave new world ain't it?! If I had to sum it up in words I would call 25B the "cheap beer" version of LSD. If LSD-25 was chilled Dom Perignon then 25B would be a room temperature Budweiser that was left open overnight. 25B is visually entertaining but lacking any real magic. This would be good for people that either don't want to or maybe shouldn't go to the places that "old school" psychedelics can send someone.

25B-NBOMe lets me want to hug every single person on earth. Lovely, not too psychedelic. Feels like a tryptamine actually, not in the 2c-e bodyload class. Acceptable.

Haha word, nice comparison man. It definitely lacks the creativity vibe of acid and any inspiration inherent to the majority of classical psychedelics.

OK I combined that with alcohol and boy is it sweet or what. My take on it is as long as you take care of your vasoconstriction its hella neat actually. Music iis so incredibly awesome in the 5HT-2A space!

Has anyone here worked out the tolerance curve for 25x-NBOMe class of chemicals? How long does one have to wait before redosing to get the same effect? I know that redosing within 24 hours seems to be worthless.

Thats what I'd like to know.


I noticed some cardiovascular stress which is not unexpected but not well tolerated. That would be about 3.6mg which has been diluted with unknown amount of dextrose thus making the whole dose-effect relationship kinda pointless ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

 I measured dose volumetrically in distilled H2O. I have a couple 1ml syringes that I got from my vet to administer meds to my cat. The syringe is divided into .1 ml increments. Each .1ml is three drops. I disolved 15mg into 1ml so that each drop= 500ug or 1.5mg per .1ml. Of course I started with a sample of known weight and worked out my dosage from that.

My wife and I got the opportunity to sample this wonderful substance. For some background we both have tried 25i-NBOME, 2-C-I, 2C-C in the phen family. We obtained 50mg of what seemed to be really pure fluffy 25b-NBOME hcl. We both measured out aprox. 500mcg and insuffulated it. Completely to our suprise and contrary to 25i we both began having visuals within 5min of taking it. 25-i usually takes about an hour to take effect by this roa. Everywhere I looked there were beautiful fractals and patterns. So much so it was hard to see the real world. Normally to get this level of effects on 25i I need over 3mg, but just 500mcg had both of us blown. Then came the nausea. We both violently through up everything in our stomachs and more. After that was over I was hit with the most amazing and intense feeling of euphoria I've ever felt from a drug of this type. My wife laughed and laughed. The primary effects lasted approximately 8 hours. With an additional 2 to 3 hours of after effects. Basically I'd describe 25b as 25i's big bad more potent cousin. Towards the end of the experance we both took several doses of mxe and etziolam which complemented it nicely and put us to sleep. All in all 25b is one stellar drug! I'd reccondmend it to anyone interested.

For my wife and I seven days is the minimum time needed to achieve to decent effects. Two weeks to have tolerance back to the point of the last time taking it, and a month to reset tolerance back to zero after excessive use. This is based on our somewhat extensive use (aprox 20+ expreances each) of 25i.

rdbomb, thank you. There is very little in the way of reports about this, so it's great to be hearing from people who have tried it.


Can you describe the body-load, and how it compared to 25I or 25C?

 It was similar to 25i but instead if the tingling body feeling it was almost like something was vibrating my body, but in a good way. 25c gave me almost no bodyload. At any rate the body load was very enjoyable on 25b.

I've never tried 2c-b only 25b-nbome. Although 2c-I is similar to 25i-NBOME, but 25i is way stronger and more euphoric in my opinion. So I'm guessing it's the same with 2c-b and 25b-NBOME.

I find that 25i has little to no similarity to 2c-i and from what I can tell that seems to be the predominant opinion: IME 25i was much more similar to DOI than 2c-i, strikingly so in the visual department. Can't comment on 25b/2c-b or 25c/2c-c though.

I left out an important detail though, which is that 25i tends to be *much* gentler than DOI. The visuals are strikingly similar but the number of positive reports for 25i far outnumbers that of DOI.

I just received some 25b. I've worked with 25c, 25d, and 25i before. 25d at 2mgs has been the most spectacular visually; although, I want to take my level of 25i up to 1.5mgs next time to see why everyone thinks this one is the glam. Maybe it was just the context, but I felt pretty fragmented and lost (akin to what I experience on LSD) on 25i, with little visuals or psychedelic ideation at 1mg. I was anxious when I explored 25c because I have severe vasoconstriction issues associated with DOC that I didn't encounter with DOB and thought maybe I had an idiosyncratic reaction to chlorinated compounds. Happily, this doesn't seem to be the case though. I can't seem to unfurl myself from the euphoric ball of bliss on my couch when I do 25c though, so I'm curious if 25b will be more social. I'm excited to try this one as to compare it to DOB and 2c-b. !!! To complete assaying a series of transformations. DOB for me didn't have a negative body load at all so I'm going to start at like 500µgs with 25b-NBOMe and see where that takes me and move up in 100µg increments.  At present, I haven't experienced any nausea, muscle tension,  or vasoconstriction issues with any of the aforementioned NBOMes I've worked with that I sometimes get with certain DOxs and 2c-xs.


I'll post my finding on 25b in the next couple of weeks after I've had a chance to assay it and I'm excited to compare to DOB and 2c-b.

As for me its like 2C-B + more like empthogen  I took only once 2 mg . Very interesting compound : quite profound however very clean mind ( headspaceis a bit like mescaline) but more opening something like 6-APB. One of the most interesting NBOMe which I tried.

Have any of you plugged this one? I have found plugging to be my only really acceptable ROA anymore, but I am finding that I am far more affected by this ROA than I expected when it comes to the NBOMe series.


In particular 300ug of 25I plugged affected me much more strongly than 1.5mg of 25I buccally.

It was 25I HCl that I complexed even though I have been told HPBCD is not necessary with the HCl salt.


So yes, the buccal application was complexed. I will have to experiment more to see if plugging is consistently so much more intense.

I'm not so sure anymore Re: complexing HCl. It's definitely not *necessary* with the HCl, but I do believe it might increase potency by a significant (enough) amount. My experience with 1mg freebase buccally complexed was much more intense than my experience with 1.2mg HCl uncomplexed. Placebo effect didn't play a role since I went into the experience thinking that there was no difference between complexed and HCl absorption.

i just received some of this substance the other day, and hope to trial it shortly. so far dosage info has been scattered, with suggestions ranging from 500-1500ug for a light-to-moderate dose, and relatively few comparatives between it and the 25X/2CX classes.


i intend to lay out some blotter shortly, with the idea being 1hit=low, 2hit=desired, 3hit=hardhead/exploratory, and based on the information ive seen im thinking 600ug would be a good activity (this is also the activity that 25I has been laid at)

A close friend took 900mics of 25B the other day, and reported it as being VERY strong, +++ bordering a ++++ on the shulgin scale.  The people saying doses must be in the multi-milligram ranges mayve had a different batch or been using poorly converted/complexed freebase material

Received some 800mcg tabs of 25b the other day. I am very experienced with 25i at high doses and assumed that 25b required slightly higher doses.


I took one 800mcg tab just to test the effects and how strong it was and this was 4 days after having a strong DOC trip. All I can say as visually it was about where i expected very mild at this dose some brightening and some movement. The headspace was a diff story though. at 800mcg it felt like a strong hit mentally and a mild/weak hit visually. Very much in an altered mental state at that level, more so than I would have guessed. Also 800mcg of 25b effected my intestines much more than 25i. A couple trips to the bathroom to empty by bowels (not puke) and I was fine after that.


Will see in the next week where this chem can go visually at higher doses.

I am going to try 25b soon.  I have a good vendor for it and am just waiting until my next paycheck before I buy.  I have never had the chance to try 2c-b so I am hoping that it might be similar.  I read a few reports on another site that said they were similar in effect.

it seems the 2c-x family and the 25x-nbome family dont necessarily step hand-in-hand between "letter gaps" (for lack of a better term). 25I reminded me strongly of 2CI, but what ive heard of 2c-b and 25b is that there are strong differences.


RUSHDAFUNK's report seems somewhat like my friend's, where there was some tremendous shifts in headspace and cognitive thought processes, though with significant alterations across the entire visual field. obviously this is a bit different from the 2cb effects (lovey, visuals, apparently similar to mdma+2ci in many ways - i still have yet to try this chem)

Speaking as someone who has done quite a bit of 2C-B i can tell you that they are absolutely nothing alike. I vastly prefer 2C-B, it is widely available, and I recommend you put the effort into finding it instead.

Right sorry it took a while, but here's what happened:


Supposedly 1mg blotters came in the post (same size as acid sized blotters).  I have no way of verifying the substance or the quantity, but for the sake of argument it was 1mg of 25B - NBOMe.


2 people ingested it, myself and another.  Held 1 each under our tongues for quite some time til it all fell to bits, had a strong chemical taste akin to acid.  First thing that became apparent was a blatant stimulant feeling maybe 20 minutes in strong enough to utterly nullify all the alcohol we'd been drinking.


About 40 minutes in a definite tryptamine headspace kinda feeling started developing, at this point was quite clear something rather intense was going on.  Was quite some time for visuals to develop properly maybe about the 1.5-2 hour mark (hard to say).  Stimulant feeling by this point (vasoconstriction and generally vibrating!) was getting rather strong bordering on a little overwhelming.


Important to note at this point the bodyload was akin to oral AMT, bit unpleasant.


A major theme of the whole experience for both of us was the illusion of being underwater.  Looking out the window/inside the flat everything was just so clearly underwater!  I as well as everything else was bobbing and floating with the current.  My partner was convinced she was drowning during the first 2-3 hours which worried me for quite some time til we ascertained it was probably psychological.


Closed eye was incredibly strong some of the most complex fractals I've ever seen made out of bits of squid and manta rays and later on generally anything else in the room (eyes open or closed).  Quite a lot of luminous flashy stuff going on.


Whole experience from kicking in to just remaining after effects was easily 9-10 hours.  Sleep was pretty much impossible until  about 6 hours after this.


Comedy moment: *"my nose is flashing look look LOOK! my nose is flashing!"

"That's your cigarette..."*


Have been pretty strung out since the experience (is somewhere between 48 and 72 hours later now), had an utterly fried head even after an initial 10 hours sleep for the entire of the next day pretty much just able to answer things to a complexity of "yes" or "no".


Sleep has been incredibly vivid, a la sleep paralysis ever since.


I believe the probably rather fantastic hangover that was going on under the surface (totally disguised by the stim effects of this substance) **could** have been largely responsible for: **heavy vasoconstriction, v. strained cardiac feeling, headaches and a few others that at times felt like they could have got v. serious v.fast.**


I got the feeling maybe 1mg was too much, but I can't say for sure based on the above paragraph^^  I may have induced my own discomfort to an unknown degree.  Other person present reported similar, but had also been drinking heavily.


All in all I'm totally unsure what to make of this.  Was a hell of a ride I'm still feeling now!


EDIT:  Totally forgot to mention, although the visuals were v. strong I felt as if the complexity of acid was missing from the thought patterns.  Not really sure I learned anything, but I saw some amazing things!


Also note:  I have not taken any tryptamines in a couple of weeks, I shouldn't have any tolerance

I can imagine!  Even last night still took me what seemed like decades to nod off, didn't actually realise I'd slept til I got up.  Out of interest how much did you take?  Did you get any of the cardiac strain effects I described?  How long til you felt normal again?


If I do again will deffo have some etizolam on hand for afterwards.

I don't really how much, it was at a "social gathering" per say haha, but it looked like the average size for a acid blotter, maybe a little smaller. And to answer your question, the only real bad effects I got from it was a pretty bad headache, but I dont know if it was from the substance or just the lack of sleep :/

No worries!  I get the feeling less alcohol and a lower dose might turn out to be a lot more pleasant.  Will probably get back to this thread on how 0.5mg feels in a week or two as there is only blotter left.

Brilliant report, thank you for sharing!


I am cautious with this one, and the NBOMes in general, since dosage info seems to be all over the place. I don't think we should assume that 1mg is a standard dose simply because the vendor sold it to us that way. As you have pointed out here, it could easily be excessive for some.

No problem!  Just as an afterthought, blotters arrived in a baggy which upon inspection has some distinct blotter shaped residue marks all over the inside of it, presumably where they've been pressing up against the edge in transport.


-I assume it's entirely possible this is 25B solution.  Could possibly be I did not even consume a full mg as some could be smudged all over the bag/ would they be daft enough to put it in the bag wet???


Not sure anyone can answer this accurately really, except maybe the person who did it.

A couple days ago I took between 900 and 1100 micrograms via the buccal route. Rapid transition into a trippy stimulated state. Overwhelming feelings, colors vibrant. After 90 minutes the peak was reached and there was a rapid fall until 5 hours later when weed was smoked. Still felt empty, perhaps from .5g mushroom 6mg miprocin trip from day before, but still...


There are better psychs out there for sure.

blotter may leave some residue on the bag, but i doubt it would be shipped while wet.


1mg is a large amount of 25B. 0.6-0.9mg is a safer dosage range, particularly for those sensitive to phenethylamines

Thanks for the report.  I've got some to try this weekend.  I'm always pretty tolerant to any hallucinogens so will try 1mg and see how I get on.  1050µg 25C from the same vendor a few weeks ago was pleasant but mild.  I'm certainly looking to ramp things up a bit.

OK well I ended up trying 1.5mg and it was a very euphoric experience but I didn't get that much visually (that is normal for me though).   I was just sitting making music though so I think I would have got more out of it in some respects if I'd been outside or socialising.

Well this 25B-NBOMe is definitely another gem in the NBOMe family

In a night like many others after some beers (3 of 1/2 liter) me and my gf went home and i decided to try this 25B HCl another time since last time with blotters didn't worked as expected.

Weighed 17mg and dissolved into 2ml of 96% alchol then added 15ml of water; the powder dissolved almost completely already in 2 ml of alchol without even moving much the liquid, it just needed 2 more ml of water to to get fully dissolved.


Measured 1ml, that was 1mg, and snorted it, this at 2AM.


As always with the Nbome the effect came up fast, in 15 minutes i was already on a +3, comparable of the same amount on 25I.

The body load was there like the other ones, i honestly don't feel all these big differences in this aspect between the various Nbome, it was quite pronounced but not unpleasant without any nausea or vasoconstriction felt.


Then i decided it wasn't enough and after 20 mins from the start i added another 0.5 ml and snorted it again.

This 0.5mg increased the trip intensity but it was still under control, not hard to handle for me, but i've already tried up to 2mg of 25I, 1.5mg of 25C and 3mg of 25D.


I still think that this dose could be too much for some people, now it was a solid +3 on shulgin scale.

More or less it is comparable to same amount of 25I but with the 25B there is much more mental clarity, i found 25I to be confusional at strong dosages.


Some stimulation but nothing to worry about, i felt really happy, the increase in mood was great like i always have with 25I and 25C.

Anyway out of all the Nbome tried this was the more lucid mentally on a solid +3 level.


The OEVs were amazing but different from 25I and 25D, they were less complex with brightest colors, very shining pulsating.

Usually with 25I i see geometric patterns all around the room, morphing and ondulating everywhere, with 25D i also see the same geometric patterns creating incredible spirals in front of my eyes.

With this 25B the patterns were less defined but constantly vibrating and pulsing, not as great as 25D ones but still amazing ones that only few substances could reach.

Anyway there wasn't the sensation of out of reality like on same dose of 25I also because these OEVs weren't surrounding you so hard but you could 'focus them' if you wanted.

Really easy to handle with this much on mental lucidity and malleable visuals, just fantastic.

DON'T expect great insights like on 25D or i could say DOC or LSD, its not so deep, introspective and spiritual as best ones in this sense.


It is an amazing shallow sustance to have a lot of fun with, you still have the typical empathy that many psych gives,in fact i also enjoyed a lot speaking about some personal issues without any dark side or fear, still more superficial discourses than i would had with 25D in the same situation.


Well i spent all the night having great fun speaking and making jokes with my gf, listening good music like God is an astronaut, for me the music is the basic thing in every trip, it changes a lot also the OEVs, stimulanting them and morphing them.


With 25B the music was great as with others Nbome, even not at the top levels as with 4-Ho-Mipt where the synesthesia was great and sometimes i lost the contact with my body starting to fluctuate between musical notes, myself became a musical note, just fantastic feeling.


The peak lasted more than with 25I or 25D, i think it lasted untill 6am so good 4 hours.

Usually with 25I the peak lasts only 2 hours or so, then it starts to decrease.

Now its 11am so +9 hours and nearly baseline but i'm sure i won't sleep in the next hours, even if i'm awake from 32 hours.


In conclusion it's indeed a great substance that i will explore more; now i'm curious to try 2C-B-Fly and see if there are similarities since I never tried 2C-B so i still can't compare to any of them.


Next on the list 25P-Nbome ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

It's important to point out that although there is a general understanding that an active dose is about 1mg and vendors are selling blotters laid accordingly, this information is incorrect. If I had to estimate, I would say that 25b is somewhere in the ball park of 25i in terms of potency or possibly even a little stronger. I dosed myself with 1.5 1mg complexed blotters buccaly last night and the results were a very intense +++ on the shugin scale. My girlfriend who is inexperienced with psychedelics took 1mg by the same route and had hours of regular out of body loops. We were both still getting visuals after 10 hours and sleep didn't come until hour 15.


Overall I would say that this is a very high quality psychedelic. A little adrenergic maybe but capable of delivering the full spectrum of effects. I have read many people comparing NBOMe's to LSD and have always put these comparisons down to the lack of experience on the part of the the commentator as the former always felt very phenethylamine-like to me. However (and I have a wide range of experience with both PEA's and acid) this experience was pretty much entirely indistinguishable from 200-300 mics of LSD.


This was by far the most visual PEA experience I have had. CEV were highly developed with more of a solid feel than DMT (less neon geometry and more complex scenes and solid objects of impossible detail). OEV were very impressive and hard to ignore for the majority of the trip. Whether 25b-NBOMe is hands down the most visual of the ones I have tried (25i, 25b, 25c, 25d) or whether this was a function of the high dose remains to be verified by further experimentation.


Psychedelic ideation and mindfuck were strongly present. Thought loops were a big part of the experience as were intense emotional moments accompanied by hugging and crying. Sex was impossible for the entire experience.


Body load was relatively non-existent for me - certainly none of the body-euphoria of 25i or the constant shitting I get on oral 2c-b/i/e. My girlfriend had some nausea coming up and complained of a tight feeling in her chest throughout the experience. I had a mild gastric upset on the comedown but otherwise the experience remained free of any discomfort. There was absolutely no jaw-clench which surprised me.


It's now almost 20 hours since coming up and other than a slight headache and a fuzzy feeling from lack of sleep, I feel pretty much ok. Last night was an unexpectedly rich trip which certainly rates as one of my strongest non-DMT experiences to date. For me it was exceptionally free of dark edges even though I spent the first 4 hours intently focussing on helping my partner through a difficult time. I could see how a ++++ would be possible on this material.

^1.5mg is a lot of 25B. I find its about 20% more potent then 25I. in most cases, 600-1000ug is sufficient.

I am going to run my first trial today.  From the reports here is seems 1mg is a moderate to strong dose so this is what I will try.  I know I have some tolerance built up since I just did 5-meo-mipt and 4-aco-dmt last night.  I know I won't get the full effect of the 25B but I am hoping this is at least enough to get a good idea of the nature of the experience.  I may try 1mg and wait an hour to see how it goes and then add another .5mg if necessary.  I know it would be better to wait a few weeks but this weekend is perfect for experiments since I have several days off with the house to myself and no distractions or drama.

I have found re-dosing with NBOMe's to be pretty ineffective. 1mg though is a relatively strong dose so you should be fine.

It feels a lot like mescaline...very nice!


Best NBOMe I have tried yet.  It was almost as good as mescaline and had very similar effects.  I would say mescaline light would be a good way to describe it.  While I was peaking I smoked 10mg of 5-meo-mipt and this sent me into psychedelic paradise...The euphoria and body high were MDMA like with vivid colors jumping around everywhere and lots of synesthesia.  Music has never sounded better!  It was an awesome trip...probably one of my top 5.  The 25B/5-meo-mipt combo is something I will have to explore again.  There was a really good synergy between the two.  The trip was very easy on the body and I woke up today feeling refreshed and alive.

1 mg to start and another .5mg 2 hours later.  The headspace was similar to 25I but felt a bit cleaner and more recreational.   The highlight was the euphoria and the psychedelic fireworks.

It's a good one isn't it? Like 25c with more "Psychedelic Headspace" and (in my opinion) less ecstasy-like love but still some euphoria.

After a brief discussion with my vendor I decided to trial 600ug rather than 300. I found it to be eerily similar to 2c-e with a less pronounced body load. At many times during the trip I found the visuals to be very similar to 150ug of LSD, but the majority of the time it was less dramatic than LSD. The psychedelic mindset brought on by the drug was extremely benign- almost non-existent in my case. The peak lasted 4-5 hours approximately. Although time dilation was noted it was never extreme. Overall I found myself enjoying this chemical very much. It's certainly a valuable tool in any aspiring psychonaut's arsenal.


 It's been said elsewhere on this board but I feel that it should be reiterated nonetheless: There are many batches of the NBOMe family circulating. Often times vendors have cut their product with dextrose in order to facilitate handling. In many of the earlier trip reports regarding 25x-nbome people reported ingesting doses above 2mg without incident. Please do not attempt this. I believe that these users encountered a cut product. I wouldn't recommend anything above 1.2mg- and that certainly is not a starting dose. Sorry if that last bit was beating a dead horse.

Good idea.  I had forgotten about that thread.   I wanted to run another test of 25B last night, it was so fun last weekend, but I want to get my nbome tolerance back down so I can fully experience 25D next weekend.  I need to go find the 25D big and dandy as well.

Ineffable14 please start with a maximum of 600ug. Just last night I decided to trial 1mg and found it to be an extreme dose. Visually it wasn't spectacular but the strain on my body became immense- or at least it felt that way. My heart felt as though it was trying to escape my chest, and I had very strange feinting spells. Keep in mind to all reading, this is while being in my refractory period from my last nbome excursion. I don't plan on trying this chemical again as it became incredibly worrisome.

Visually it wasn't spectacular but the strain on my body became immense- or at least it felt that way. My heart felt as though it was trying to escape my chest, and I had very strange feinting spells. Keep in mind to all reading, this is while being in my refractory period from my last nbome excursion. I don't plan on trying this chemical again as it became incredibly worrisome.

Why the change in heart whiterab? Your last post seemed like you ejoyed lower doses. Did this chem produce negative effects when you dosed 600mics?

At 600mics it was an excellent experience with very little to no negative side effects, however when I trialed 1.2 mg (my above says 1mg but it was 1.2 I realized later) things got wonky.

I've tried 25i, 25c, and 25b now. I find that sublingual for 25c, and 25b tends to suck, 25i sublingual worked fine for me so I'm unsure why. The best ROA for 25b I find is intransal, I make a solution that's 5units/500ug25b then shoot it up my nose with an insulin syringe. I've tested 25b out, around 4-5 times now including combinations, and I find that it's extremely euphoric and has nice visuals. 25b + 25i is a combination I really want to try, I don't have any 25i and I doubt I'll be getting any soon but when I do I'll report back.


+0:00: 500ug intranasal in solution shot up nose. Within minutes I feel a tingling sensation in my body but the effects don't come on nearly as quickly as I expected.

+1:00: Visuals not so strong, take another 500ug intransal to guarantee an extremely visual experience.

+1:30: Visuals are in full swing, my curtains are mesmerizing to stare at, so many colors and swirling lines. Extremely happy and euphoric, slight erotic push that I choose to not pursue. 

+2:00: Start listening to music, sounds better than usual not nearly as good as 25i. My muscles feel so strange, this always happens on nbomes, it feels like theres acid in my muscles as if I had just had an extremely intense long workout and sat down right away as opposed to stretching out so lactic acid doesn't build in the muscles. The pain is worst on the insides of my legs near my crotch makes standing a huge pain. Decide to lay down and watch a movie.

+3:00: Every time I watch a movie while tripping I find that any visuals I was having around real world objects tend to fade away, the movie looks just like it would sober. I was watching one of the futurama movies because I thought the cartoonish look would be awesome tripping but it didn't turn out to be so. The movie is hilarious so I continue to watch anyway.

+4:30: Movie is over, spend the rest of the trip on my computer browsing the internet, listening to music and trying to play games. Games I was familiar with were difficult to play. I fall asleep fairly easily around +6:30-7:30


If you intend to redose I recommend doing it before the +1:30 mark because every time I do it after +1:30, I get a really bad headache on the tail end of the trip. This might not apply to sublingual administration

Might not be a great idea. I read a post where somebody combined 25C and 25I and the vasoconstriction was so bad his feet turned blue.

Really wanted to throw this out there earlier, but I've been without internet for pushing 2 months.  Did my half a mg test about a month ago, (1 blotter snipped in half consumed by two people).  How much I actually had is a total speculation as these things are tiny so accuracy is questionable although both parties involved had a similar experience so can't have been that bad!


Here goes:


Quite a mild experience, any visual stuff only totalled about an hour in duration, stimulant effects barely present and physical discomfort totally absent.  Although mild the whole experience was entirely enjoyable, definite boost in mood and shift in headset which kept us both laughing and chatting considerably more than before consumption for its entire duration of maybe 4 or 5 hours max.  On wearing off sleep was not tricky at all and probably came to us both within 1 or 2 hours with no noticeable after effects the next day!


If you've read what occurred to us at 1mg: striking visuals, strong (and scary!) cardiac discomfort a duration of 10 hours and a total inability to sleep or thing properly for days to come I would hazard a guess:


"If a sweet spot DOES exist, its somewhere BETWEEN .5 and 1mg"

I don't get much vascoconstriction on nbomes, I've mixed 25i and 25c together before as well as 25c and 25b on a few occasions. But a recent way too fucking intense intranasal experience has made me want to avoid nbomes(shitty inaccurate scale, need a better one but I'm a cheap ass), I now have access to a large amount of tryptamines and I realized how much more I enjoy them than nbomes, and people have taken 100mg+ of these substances and been fine physically, so I don't ever have to worry about oding while I'm tripping. That tends to be the cause of most of my bad trips.

has anyone a bioavailability comparison of the active ROAs?

how dosages differ from nasal to plugging for instance. 


and you people that make a solution, do you apply this nasally with a spray/pump or with a dropper? (does the drops stay in your nose until absorbed or run down into your stomach?)


i'm new to sniffing solutions.. always plugged liquids so far, but am eager to try a liquid up my nose

Space your dosing out definitely, spread your dose in half or thirds and take one every 15minutes or so. The nbomes have a much faster harder to deal with comeup nasally. One 500-750ug intranasal come up had me shaking so hard and uncontrollably that I honestly thought I was gonna have a seizure and die. The only reason I didn't go to the hospital was cause I knew that my scale is not so inaccurate that I could have taken more than a mg at most. But because I took it as one single dose and didn't space it out I had a terrible terrible time. After A few hours and a few bowls to calm my mind I had a somewhat decent experience.

Well I really enjoyed 25b and it was the first nbome I have tried so I can't compare between them. 500 mics intranasal had a pretty quick comeup for me, first effects within 20 minutes, peaking by around an hour, but I didn't think it was too bad, minor jitters, no nausea, but otherwise pretty fucking euphoric and relaxing. Visuals were present but mild, and they were cool, but I wasn't too focused on them. Smooth, comfortable, social, and functional high. I took 200 more mics about 2 hours into it, probably didn't really need to, and it definitely extended the duration. The comedown left me feeling fairly crashed out and overstimmed, total duration definitely lasted at least 10 hours but I felt fine the next day, not too drained. Definitely want to figure out the sweet spot dose, because overall I thought 25b was amazingly euphoric stuff!

did 600ug nasal lately. comeup was very fast, first effects were noticeable after 10-15 minutes. peak around 45mins in, lasted good 3 hours with insane visuals of patterning, morphing, color cycling (kaleidoscope vision) and light trails everywhere. the bodyload however was quite as nasty as the one on 2c-p, no nausea tho but pretty much jitters, hot-cold sensations.

the trip itself was deep and insightful, also had a good set & setting and laughter for hours until my bellymuscles hurt from laughing.


after around 4 hours comedown was noticeable as the visual fireworks slowly began to fade. we decided to mix some MXE into the 25B afterglow and faded into lala-land again. be conservative on your usual MXE dose, since the presence of a strong phen like 25B interacts quite actively with dissociatives. if you like ego-death flights and outter body experiences, this combo is pretty useful, but i'd wait with until post-peak of NBOMe before getting into dissociatives. i guess other way around could get pretty messy.


25B is a pretty amazing ride!

I accidentally did way too much of this at the weekend and had the strongest trip ive ever had, within 2 minutes everything started vibrating then absolutely uncontrollable visuals for about two hours, not a bad trip just very very strong. After that it was quite pleasant though, no more ill effects.

Check this out. It shows just how strong this chemical is. It was tested on anesthetized pigs in this study. They used positron emission tomography (PET) to see where in the brain these phenethylamines are distributed and to determine their 5HT2A activation. They tested 25c 25I and 25B. Look at the page with the picture of the brain scans. See the brain on the far right that's lit up like a christmas tree? That's how powerful 25b is compared to 25c and 25I. Can't wait to get some.

A starting dose should be between .2-.6 mg. Not up to 1 mg, that's a fairly strong dose IME. Nasally anyway

This seems like the least rewarding of the new "25" series from what I am reading here... And the other ones don't seem to be cut... So how can we even be sure those huge (3mg+) doses are even 25B?

No way to really know unless you have your "25B" tested and verify the purity. I nasal dripped 400ug, and that was strong, so be very careful with this one. Those high doses (3mg+) could be for various reasons , start low as always. 1mg nasal  is not even possible with me, ymmv though.

Finally got around to trying this one. Did an allergy test of 50mcg then four months later tried a full dose.

Dosed 600mcg nasally, we had blotter and soaked them in water then insulfalated the water. Came on in 15 mins, absolutely amazing. Extremely visual and comfortable on the body, no body load what so ever, which is crazy for me because phens always make me puke on the come up. Very reminiscent of 2cb. Effects lasted about 4 hours, at hour six I dosed .5 mg etizolam and  cannabis to get some sleep. Felt great the next day. Glad to have had an opportunity to try this one, it felt very physically safe at that dose, a few friends reported feeling "electrified" but I felt none of that. The entire trip was spent relaxing in a giggly state of euphoria, almost childlike.

up to 6mg 25i? Was there tolerance? 25B is very potent, but do you know if the 6mg 25I batch was pure?

I just received a few hits of HPBCD complexed NBOMe blots. My plan was to space out the 3 (25B, 25I, 25C) over the course of six weeks with my buddy, and tomorrow marks our first adventure.

I was planning to take 1.5 hits of 25B tomorrow. That would give me a dose of 1500ug. I plan to sublingually/buccally administer the tabs.


...from what I'm reading this seems like too large a dose. Why does 25B have such a greater binding affinity to 5HT than 25I/25C?

I may only dose 1mg.

When i took the 6mg of 25i i had a tolerance to phenethylamines. When i did the 25b i had a signifigantly lower tolerance Also the 25i was pure.

Another death, in Houston, Texas. 2 hits, unknown dosage but assumed relatively high. 18-year-old girl, under 100lb. User was on prescribed anti-depressants. I would use extreme caution with 25b, and do not take any unknown psychadelic, as 25b is being sold as LSD with no regard for safety. (If it's bitter.. it's a spitter.)

Just had to quick reply here from my mobile. HALF one tab of 1mg HPBCD complexed botter taken at 3:22 this afternoon. 500ug personal consumption. Effects noticed within one hour. Hilarity was the theme of the come up. Physically, there was mydriasis and uncontrollable facial muscle spasms, noticed mostly when smiling, it felt as if something sinister was trying to hold me back from experiencing what i was about to experience- I have felt this way on 2C-B which was fascinating, personally, to correlate.  


The real gem and reward in taking 500ug buccally/sublingually of 25B-NBOMe was the profound ability of empathy and insight I gained.


 I brought my friend along for the journey this evening, him also having dosed the same amount as I, and, through my own formulation of words and wisdom, was able to bring back the emotions and hallucinations experienced at an unknown overdosage of DOC that my friend had been through two years ago that he has sheltered and kept at bay since. It was an emotional bonding experience for the both of us. 


Visually it was equipotent to experiences i have had with 2C-B in dosages between 12 and 20mg. Spurts of visuals. OEVs much more so than CEVs , which again in my own experience, correlates with the visuals I have experienced with the phenethylamine counterpart (2C-B).


Mentally, I was tripping. I hit a ++ for a brief moment of time,roughly 3 hours after ingestion. However, the mental.stimulation and the confidence I seemed to gain from the dose was revelating. 


It was ~11:52pm and 1mg clonazepam was orally administered to abort the mission.


It is 2:22am now, 10hrs later, and I still feel lingering psychosomatic effects. Even after 600mg ibuprofen, 1mg clonazepam and countless bong rips, I still feel the 500ug dose lingering.


This chem felt the most similar to LSD in terms of introspection and overall creativity. Visually it felt most similar to 2C-B. Overall I would like to increase my dose, but work my way up to a full milligram.


And for the record I have plenty of expereince with drug use and tripping especially. What the NBOMe series is teaching me is to be responsible and start low. 500ug proved to be a trip in itself, and a fantastic one at that.

 I can completely imagine how insane it must have been. I dont think I will even take a full tab of 25B, it is far more potent at 500ug than 25C, in my experience.

Don't do anything without a scale. How do you know that your 10mg isn't in fact 45mg? Are you willing to risk your life on the assumption that the supplier weighed correctly or didn't slip in a little more as a nicety?

And you are willing to trust your life on the fact that whoever wrote that label either knew or cared what they were doing?


Last time I bought 100mg of 25i-NBOMe (from a seller I trust), it weighed in at 56mg. It said 100mg on the packet though.

^ Indeed, it's also common for vendors to send extra as an incentive to like them and come back for more, as they usually assume the people using their products have scales. Often the vendors will label the extra amount given, but many times they won't bother. 


As for how you can measure it without a scale, you can use [volumetric measurement](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=286239) (see link), but that's only if you can reliably assume how much you have to begin with. 


Since I have the feeling you're going to take the risk with the potentially unknown amount either way, the only thing I can advice to reduce your risk is to assume you were given much more than it says on the label. Dilute your supposed 10mg in solution, then for safety's sake, assume it is say 30mg, and dose according to that, e.g. dose 1/100th of the solution, if that's 10mg that should be 100ug, and you should either feel nothing or barely threshold effects, while if it's 30mg you should have a light comfortable trip. Then you can titrate from there onwards onto the dose that works for you. In reality I'd advise you assume your powder is 100mg+ though, you might waste more powder titrating up this way but safety comes first with such potent substances.


Although I wouldn't normally advise it, you can use volumetric measurement without a scale - the great thing about volumetric measurement is that if say 0.5ml of solution is a good dose for you one time, that's your dose - and you can dose accurately from then on. If you have an unknown amount of powder to begin with, you should take the estimate of how much you have, grossly increase it to account for extra, and then take the tiniest possible dose you could imagine that's likely to produce no/very little effects and work up from there until you find your sweet spot. Once you've found your sweet spot you know how much to take next time, even if you don't know the actual mg/ml dosage. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It's much better to get a scale in the long run though, to use this very fine titration method takes a lot of time (especially with the NBOMes having such long lasting tolerance) and patience, and you'll use more substance than you would have done if you could have just picked an accurate dosage to begin with. You can get scales for as little as $15, and in my experience even such cheap scales are accurate to within 1-2mg, and it'll really save you time, effort, and risk in the long haul.


If you need help buying scales and don't know where to get one suitable for you, then head on over to the [scale thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=348436) ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

What sorts of amounts are you referring to eyeballing? The human eye simply cannot accurately discern such doses. It can pick out that yes this pile of powder appears to be the same as the previous pile of powder I had, so you can assume that you know the dosage based on that - but all it takes is a little alteration in your lighting or how the powder has stacked, or any sort of minor misjudgement and your 5mg pile can look identical to the 3mg you weighed earlier.


I can see where you're coming from as I have in the past had a few times where I did not have a scale to hand and wanted to use AM-2201, a highly potent cannabinoid also active in the microgram range like NBOMes - in my case I found a particular very thin stick I had seemed to hold just the right amount of powder on the end, and for the most part the dose seemed about the same each time I did it, but trust me when I say that while various things may improve the likelihood of your eyeballing be accurate, you're still leaving it largely down to chance - and you *will* get your ass kicked and end up taking too much. 


The difference is, while I would not repeat what I did, because smoking too much AM-2201 is by no means a fun ordeal - the difference in dosage that caused me to go from having a pleasant high to having severe panic attacks is enough with these NBOMes on the other hand to be the difference between a fun trip and a trip to the hospital or the morgue. 


Even if by some stroke of luck you've perfected a method that leaves your dosing mostly correct 95 times out of 100, when just one of those 5 times it's incorrect could put an end to your life you should really re-evaluate why you're happy to take such a gamble with your life over any drug, and not just spend $15 to get yourself a set of scales. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


If you're talking about measuring say 100mg by eye, and then diluting it in solution for more accurate measurement, then you might have more luck with this, after having dealt with the powder several times before, but even so there's still a huge room for mistakes. Even if you're doing this, then as I said in my post you should assume you've used much more powder and take the most minute dose possible to avoid any risk of overdosing, and work up from there. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This is the way I had done it when I first started experimenting with nbomes, and yes I never tried to eyeball a 'dose', I would eyeball it 1 'grain' at a time as you said.  However this is still very dangerous, especially with drugs like 25I where the volume it appears to take up is much smaller so the dose is much harder to 'see'.  When I had done this the drug in question was 25C.


The only time I got TOO much nbome was not from eyeballing, it was from rinsing a leftover plastic vial that once contained 25I and had a STRANGE chemical smell to it (like chlorine I guess, but different).  I dropped a few drops of water in there, knowing I smelled SOMETHING but I saw nothing in there.  Note that I had washed this container out with water before and that was a relatively weak trip.  I let the container sit for weeks after that weak trip and the smell had built up in it, so I dropped some water in it and insufflated it.  I have no idea the dose obviously, but it was stronger and much different than any 25I trip I had had before.  Very much a relaxed, 'out-of-it' (like the unique feeling of 2C-I), with strong visuals.


I would recommend anyone that gets these in plastic vials to not rinse them out because in my case the material seemed to etch marks in the plastic and subsequently hold itself there.. not being able to be rinsed out at first but it was able to weeks later.

Way less bodyload and way more visual. Start very low, like 350ug and work your way up especially if LSA is the only psychedelic you have experience with. I find 25b a bit more potent than its counter parts. I was a fool and once took 4-5mgs nasally(thought I had fake stuff) and Im pretty sure it almost killed me.

have tried LSA, mescaline and salvia but thinking 25B-NBOMe would be a closer analogue to LSA. Getting 1 mg blotters would  it be safe to start with whole blotter or half better? i am planing to trip at weekend

25b-NBOMe isn't an analogue of LSA. They belong to totally different chemical families. It's more closely related to mescaline but still not closely enough to be considered analogous. 


1mg is a high dose. I would start with half that.

Thats precisely what I did, split a 1mg blotter with a friend. We were both overwhelmed at the intensity of HALF a tab. Always start in the 300-500ug with 25B, you can always set a day aside for a whole milligram, but get there safely!

thanx will take half a tab of 25b-NBOMe also got hold of 25c-NBOMe & 25i-NBOMe how does 25b-NBOMe compare with its analogues which should i try first as it seems reading through bl that 25b-NBOMe lasts longer than the other 2 i have aquired though i thought would be less intense than others

As far as B, I, and C are concerned,I'd say that C is most potent by weight, followed by B, then I. I found 25I rather stimulating at 550ug and 25C very colorful at 525ug.

It's probably time to repeat what is elsewhere in this thread. 


One if the first batches of 25b-NBOMe to appear on the market was for some reason cut with 50% filler. Because of this, doses were often reported as being twice what they actually are. For this reason you will see vendors offering something like 350μg 25c blotters, 600μg 25i blotters and 1mg 25b blotters. In this scenario, the 25b is effectively dosed twice as highly as the other two products. The equivalend dosage should be about 500μg.


Vendors are lazy and have just read the first couple of pages of this or similar Internet discussion threads and knocked up a product accordingly. They probably realise their mistake now but have stock to get rid of so don't care. This can lead to overdose so **be careful! If you have 1mg blotters, start with half**.


(Mods: maybe this info should go at the beginning of the thread?)

i got 2mg 25b-nbome blotters and my supplier said the dosage range was the same as with 25i-nbome. 

i think that you should take a lot more of 25b than 25i, because there is no mind-space so why not hallucinate more? i took half a blotter (1mg) and i noticed that the visuals were very present but it was only visuals. next time i'll try 2mg 25b-nbome. i also have done 1200ug 25i-nbome and 1200ug 25c-nbome(with tolerance from a week before). i found 25c-nbome to be very dull.


also, paintings are really awesome while on 25b, and because there is next to no mind-space 25b could be suitable for museum visits.

Wow, 1mg of 25b sub/buccal would have me tripping my face off, both visually and mentally.  I would **strongly** suggest working your way up much slower, ideally in increments of 250ug, *maximum* 500ug, and I would only do that if you were completely underwhelmed from your starting dose.  Even then that would be risky. IME, doubling the dose is like a ten fold increase of effects when compared to most other psychedelics, especially tryptamines.

Trying 25b for my first time next weekend. Hoping it has visuals like 25i, but not as much of a body load. 

I've heard the nbomes are not effective if you redose within the same day? Like taking one half an hour or two later will have little to no effect. Is that true? Because I was planning to take one half of a tab, then the other half 1 hr later.

You will be running into tolerance after an hour in my experience. Try redosing after 40 minutes

Wondering if people with experience can comment on the appearance of 25B-NBOMe powder.


I recently obtained some 25B powder. It's white and has a fluffy consistency very similar to 2CE. I was a little surprised to see that the 25B looks very different to 25I NBOMe, which is a very fine grainy powder with a cinnamon coloring in my experience.


I just wanted to check that white, fluffy 25B NBOMe is normal, or consistent with other peoples experiences in case Ive been sold 2CE or something by mistake.

I'm not sure if physical appearance is really the deciding factor with these chemicals.  The 25B-NBOMe that I have is pretty much as you describe, but my 25C-NBOMe is more of a very fine grain that's very sparkly.  I'm not entirely sure but I'd guess the difference has more to do with the method used for recrystallization.

I posted this yesterday, but my account is having issues so I'll repost.


I know that appearance is not going to be a definitive identifying character, however I just wanted to see if this description (white, fluffy powder, similar to 2CE) was consistent with what other people had observed with 25B. I am a bit thrown off because as i said, 25I is a grainy, cinnamon colored powder in my experience, and when I look at the pic on Erowid, 25C looks like its similar: (grainy, off white/ brown), therefore I would have guessed that 25B would be similar... I don't have any other way of testing my product. But I draw some comfort from your comment mozokev that the 25B you've seen fits my description...

On another note. Im interested to know what the dosage profile is for 25B, reading through this thread I suspect its pretty similar to 25I. Erowid doesn't have any dosage advice for 25B similar to what they have for 25I. 


So here's a little activity for anyone who has experience with 25B and has a few minutes spare.


Copy and paste the tables below into a post, fill in the blanks and post it in this thread. Only fill in the blanks that you have experience for. 

If we get enough replies maybe we can take some averages and settle on a tentative dosage profile for this chem similar to the dosage profiles Erowid provides.


And to avoid complication we are talking about pure chemical, not product that's been cut (as discussed in the first few pages of this thread).

I had the opportunity to try 25B for the first time yesterday. I kept the dose pretty low because I know from experience that I trip easily.

I took 250ug (half a 500ug tab) of complexed 25B HCL blotter. I held the blotter between my top lip and gum for 15 mins or so. It tasted bitter.


The effects came on fairly slowly, after 20 minutes I could feel a definite change in my state of mind. After 40 minutes I had the full effects. Colors shifted and shimmered and changed on the surface of everything I looked at. I didn't get the strong patterning and light show kind of visuals that I have experienced on 25I. Instead the visuals were much more about shifting and vivid colors. I spent what seemed like an hour watching the play of light through the window onto my bedroom wall. The combination of light and shadow was mesmerizing and I could really notice the different hues of color breaking apart in the light. magenta, blue and white, they all seemed to shift and blend and merge in and out of shadow. I couldn't look away.


Thought loops were part of the trip. I found myself deeply introspective, contemplating my life, things I wanted to do, what I was happy with, what I wasn't happy with. I felt quite scattered at the height of the trip, leaving my room to get something, then forgetting what I wanted and just wandering about tugging my lip and contemplating. A friend came over to hang out and make some food. Juice tasted amazing. Music made me feel 'ripply' and i felt little flashes of euphoria with the peaks in the music. The whole experience probably lasted about 5-6 hours after which I was back to base line. The peak probably lasted about 1-1.5 hrs. 


I enjoyed the experience. I found at this dose it was very manageable and pleasant. I personally don't like dosing high. I don't enjoy the feeling of being over whelmed and out of control. IMO people who talk about dosing 1mg etc are just taking way too high doses or don't have well prepared product maybe? In my experience HPBCD complexed NBOMe is definitely stronger than uncomplexed product, both for HCL and freebase. I had a fantastic little trip on just 250ug complexed blotter and to be honest I dont feel the need to go any higher. I do know that I have a low tolerance for all psychedelics that I have ever tried though, plus I dont weigh much (65kg). But I recommend to anyone contemplating trying this, start low. I just cant imagine the mind fuck of this substance at 1mg... for me I know that would be way too much for a pleasant experience.

I have to add that I think this is the most potent NBOME FWIW, so to those testing it out, be careful. If you nasal drip this go VERY low, like 300ug to start.

300ug nasal is not "very low" considering you think it's the most potent NBOMe. 300ug nasally would be quite a moderate-to-strong trip of 25i/c for a decent amount of people, including me. I suggest, if this is truly the most potent NBOMe, to start at *no more* than 100ug nasally and titrate up to find your sweetspot.

Not 25D? I had a pretty magical experience with the stuff, barring the fact that it was way too intense for the majority of it. But it seemed the most deep and "fluid" if you will of the ones I've tried (which is only i, c and d.)

So, about 1 week ago I dosed 2mg sublingually. I know this was probably a very high dose and very stupid of me, however it was my third time in the past month and 1mg wasn't doing much for me anymore.

Not even 20 minutes in, the rainbow trails started to appear. I went and laid in bed, and for the whole first hour I was too overwhelmed to even move. For some reason, the darker it was, the stronger the visuals. So I went under my covers which was kind of stupid since I was already having trouble remembering how to breathe. If anything went wrong, it definitely would've been me doing something stupid to myself, not directly ODing. My thoughts were extremely repetitive and would cut off. I tried writing notes on my iPod and they look like "It doesn't make sense to me why ....  It's so funny when ....." and a bunch of other cut-off repetitive things lol. Visuals were so crazy. There were all these rainbow creatures that were dancing to my music. At one point they turned to black monsters that I thought were dropping me in a black hole. Their hands were about to let go of me and I thought maybe it was a sign that I was going to OD/die but I realized that the opening between me and the blanket was just falling.

Overall, this is a fun and long lasting drug. Things seem extremely funny on it. But it's not like LSD where you will have insightful thoughts.

That's a dangerous level IMO. I've been there, and it's really fun I agree. But looking back, I did kinda lose my mind. Having seen some trips that went badly, and reading about deaths makes me tread a lot more carefully with NBOMEs.

I was wondering that myself, I tried it for the first time Wednesday and i'd have to say 25I doesn't even come close.


I'd done some 25I about 3 days prior and to try and compensate for tolerance I decided to take a tab and a half, each tab was 1250 micrograms, i vastly underestimated it, was totally overwhelmed for an hour or so (not in a panicky way) even after that i was unable to see the floor due to the neon glow, it seemed every hour or so the trip would change, like i was going through different layers of reality, at one point I was unsure of who i was, not as in forgetting my name, more having trouble getting my head around the concept that i was my own entity if that makes sense? felt moreish but not in a craving kind of way, I just wanted to see how far through reality i could get.


Probably my best trip to date (not that i've done a huge deal of tripping) had a very positive mental attitude about everything since then ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I agree, im surprised this one is so low on the radar compared to 25I. I loved my experience on 25B. Its equally as enjoyable as 25I, and definitely stronger IME. (I still love 25i though ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)).

Every individual reacts differently to psychoactives. Psychedelics can be powerful tools for self discovery. Used responsibly they can facilitate radical positive changes in perceptual paradigm  leading to insights that can have powerful effects on the way we chose to approach life sober. Used ignorantly or irresponsibly they can be dangerous. In the hope to defend the value of this chemical for a post prohibition day I have chosen to post the following in the interest of harm reduction. Remember if we abuse these chemicals and behave irresponsibly society will view them as destructive or, if we use them responsibly, our behaviour as individuals who chose to use psychedelics can send the most positive message possible about their potential.


A sample of 2-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl] was prepared by weighing on an analog balance precise in 10mg increments. The dose was further reduced by volumetric measurement in pure distilled h2o. Composition of the compound was confirmed via nmr.


Dose: 300ug

Route of administration: Intranasal (A portion of the prepared h20 was insuffulated)

Duration: 10hrs 

Comments: This dose was way to much for me. The effects took hold nearly instantaneously. Within 10 minutes I lost complete connection from reality. Aside from being incapable of moving for several hours I didn't notice any physical complications. Its hard to put an experience such as this into words. It was as if I shattered into an infinite number of pieces and died. As the amnesia and thought looping started to taper off I experienced an emotionally overwhelming experience I can only define as being born. The process took several hours and involved reliving my past chronologically and having to reintegrate every experience and idea consciously as it came up. It ended in several hours of crying overwhelmed by shame and guilt at the status of cognitive liberty in the country I live in. I was asleep after 12 hours. There was a warm peaceful afterglow that wasn't unpleasant or psychedelic for a couple days.

Retrospective: This sort of experience is hard to define as euphoric or dysphoric. During the peak I experienced undulating emotional extremes. After the peak it was very difficult emotionally but productive. I imagine the last part could have been more posotive and equaly profound for another person. I wouldn't define this experience as recreational.


Please be responsible and honest with these chemicals. I have herd of people taking much higher doses. As I was physically incapacitated for several hours at the aforementioned dose this leads me to believe that individual variations in neuro chemistry or diet are very influential. This should be taken into account when using or sharing any chemical. The future of very valuable tools is in our hands please be honest and responsible.

If it's 2C-B, take 20 mg orally.  If it's 25B-NBOME, snort or put under your tongue 250 micrograms.


To InfantAnnihilator:  "Go do some reading" I had to read to know that you said that.  In that same space you could have instead been helpful.  Saying "Go" and telling someone to figure out something on their own is not productive nor is even fit for a post.  You're supposed to be the one typing the stuff that you want MinusAgony to read.  Also telling someone to "go" when they have drugs won't work.  They'll either do them with your help, or do them without your help.  Which sounds worse to you?


You know, there's a point in your life when you need to stop doing things based on emotion, and do them based only on utility.  Hey, maybe that's robotic, but at least it's useful.

Well, I reread MinusAgony's post, and I misread what he said which is why I got confused thinking he may be meaning 2c-b due to the 20mg he mentioned. Turns out thats just what he used for his solution. Water under the bridge, whatever.


He's been reading for years but somehow thinks swallowing the substance will work? Then posts wondering why it doesnt work? Theres no need for me to rehash what has been said a million times and is plainly evident in any and all of the many NBOMe threads out there. Heck it was already answered for him: shit isnt active orally. He already has it, already mixed a solution and already tried and failed. He came here because he knew something was wrong, he at least was "wise" enough to "only" try 1mg the first time so he must have done *some* reading, but clearly not enough. 


So he mixed 20mg into 100ml of lime juice giving 1mg/5ml.. brilliant, thats about as useful as well, not much now. You snort 5ml of limejuice and get back to me on how that feels. Heck even the 1.25ml (250ug) you recommended won't be very enjoyable even if you can manage to hold that much liquid in your nose (which you cannot). Even holding 5ml in your mouth is going to be a pain, thats quit a bit of fluid really, I suppose you could make do though. Plus with the whole sublingual/buccal route there is the whole issue of proper absorption, hence all the talk about complexing with HPBCD. I don't hear anyone talking about that anymore, its typically all the older posts from 2011 so I have to wonder if thats been deemed somewhat unnecessary or what? This is mainly why I chose to go with the nasal ROA. Its pretty guaranteed that you;re going to get the dose you intended to. How did I come to this conclusion? By reading.


I just say read more, because it is all out there spelled out numerous times really. It sounds to me like he got hold of the substance, popped on for two seconds, thought he got the gist and went for it. Maybe it bothers me just because I researched and studied every bit I could find on here about 25i before I tried it. I read the threads, I learned which ways it was active and which it wasn't, what the best roa was, how to make a solution, how dilute to make the solution, what the best solvent is, how to actually administer given my chosen roa, how to store it, which dose I would start with as a safety precaution due to all the huss and fuss about seizures and death etc. All before I actually had the substance in my possession. Even when I got the stuff, I didn't have a proper vessel to hold my solution so I waited until I did to do it. I didn't even really have to ask any questions at all, it was all here for me. I did make a post clarifying everything I was going to do just in case I missed something, but I was given the green-light.


Impatience and lack of research are the main culprits for people fucking up, and reading is the only way to ensure you don't make those mistakes. People are referred to read threads ALL the time.


Perhaps some of what I am saying is from an emotional side of view, but a lot of it is based in 'utility' - as you would say - extending far beyond using RCs and into many other aspects of real life. I didn't want to tell him he was stupid or he did everything wrong, so I told him to go and do a little reading, and it should become pretty damn clear where he went wrong. I'm not the only person who responded to him either. I guess I could have told him the reason he had a problem was because he didnt stir his solution.

Getting a sheet of this stuff soon, but the blotters are (allegedly) 1.3mg. Is that a lot for 25B?

That's a pretty high dose IMO. I have done 1.5mg with tolerance. It was intense to say the least. 


Bare in mind that the dose may be that high because its un complexed and therefore inefficient at absorption? Otherwise why are vendors engaged in a stupid arms race regarding who can make the strongest blotters? It's just going to lead to freakouts.

It is complexed (allegedly), which is the crazy part. I think I might have to start this one out with half a tab.

Try 1/3, from what I heard this one can be really strong for some people.  Despite what is said I think it's stronger than 25I.

I agree with this, 25B is stronger but I have never taken the same dose. I just couldn't have the guts to nasal drip 1mg 25B, and not even sure if I could do 25I like that again.  Be careful with these, you can alway do a higher dose 2 weeks after.If you aren't sure, at least have an atypical antipsychotic to end the trip if it goes too far . I have yet to use an atypical for this, but it is there if I need it. Some like benzo's as well, but why not have both on you just in case?

It's potency lies half way between 25c and 25i. People who say its less potent than 25i are just repeating a persistent myth. I think that 500-750μg is a good starting dose. 


As my girlfriend found out, 1mg is too much for a psychedelic naive person.

I used up to 1.5 mg of 25b bucally, and it was not even strong enough, because I have weird metabolism. 

My buddy did 1 mg of same batch and it was too much, he had something like a bad trip.

i have  to disagree that the vascularconstriction is worse than 25c i havnt tried any onther of the series atry except 2c nbome but vascular constriction is much less pronounced than its chloro cousin. plus i might add that the visuals are more orb like and more pronounced with a higher degree of clarity and morphing abity . the color spectrum is beautiful with purple and magenta , green and silver hues when viewed at low light (witch i prefer) Music sounds amazing especially bass music an watching the milk drop winamp plugin on a tv with the lights off is where this chem really shines. and the duration is longer than 2c nbome with a 900mg dose lasting about 8+ hours easily for me. this compound is very pleasing when combined with MDMA. i think iwill try c30 nbome next...

It clearly reads 25b on the package, tested again .5mg insufflated with beautiful results.


Measured 10mg, on a .001 and then added 20ml cold water to a bottle and dumped the 25b in,

warm water may have diluted it quicker but the cold water took hours. With a liquid measuring

utensil I drew 1ml (.5mg, 500ug) and it magically flew up my nose. Within a half hour I was

feeling the typical psychedelic everything, peace, love, unity, respect... no complaints. I wish

you could see it for yourself.


When I said I get it, that's was me saying OHHH nasal, duh. Lime juice down the drain, not

even about to play jackass there. No big loss. Some say oral some say not... this is a first.

Well if you have more pixels on the same size sensor, then the pixels are smaller which makes them of a lower quality. With screen density, you have to weigh in performance of the machine. The 13" rMBP has a beautiful screen, but the entire thing lags a lot. With CPUs the example is easy: a Pentium 4 is clocked at 3.3GHz, while the latest i7 is 2.5GHz. Even when you take away the 3 extra cores of the i7 it would still perform faster than the Pentium.

.75mg was also pleasant, nothing overwhelming there... actually redosed .5mg after a few hours, and then .5mg again after a few hours - the effects didn't intensify but they showed themselves again - which I thought was neat. Had someone with who wanted to redose first so I kept an eye on him and it was about a half hour by the time he started cracking up I just had to give it another go. I can totally mind fuck someone but this one was gentle enough that paranoia was easy to ignore, not saying it's impossible, just that the paranoia level was WAAAAAAY down. Big plus. The talkativeness was minimal, didn't feel like an inquisition or a never-ending tell all, just a nice mellow yet trippy night that got slept off after 6-8 hours.


Edit: 2mg doesn't feel much stonger than .75  ... hmmm maybe the tolerance from doing it just 2 days earlier, but I know some things like weed have a point where it just kinda levels off and like The Doors said "Girl, we couldn't get much higher", I don't mean for people to just go batshit crazy and do waaaay too much, but some of these things do have limits... Phenazepam I believe is one of them but don't quote me on that. Read read read. The point Shulgin makes a couple of times is to be cautious, don't waste (or was that me...?), and don't underestimate these things. Some of them can and have killed.

Yes, it's definitely the tolerance from just 2 days ago. The NBOMes seem to create a strong tolerance and most people recommend 14 days between use.

When taking nbome's frequently who knows what kind of devastating health effects it could cause. Aside from serious brain damage, some physical health effects could easily come about.

I recently acquired some 25B tabs that I am excited to try. The thing is, each tab is 1mg and complexed. Now I consider myself an experienced psychonaut and I also have a high natural tolerance for all drugs (45mg 2C-B is the lower end of a +++ for me, 20mg 2C-E did literally nothing, etc.) but this kind of dosage worries me a bit. I know the thread poll says that most people say that the max dose is above 1200ug, but is that complex or not? What do you guys think? NB: I was planning on doing a tiny sliver of a tab as an allergy test first

I think that's what I'm going to end up doing. I have a feeling I'm just being a bit paranoid because I don't really have any experience with complexed tabs. I've experimented with 25I up to 2mgs and with 2C-B up to 60mg, so I feel like I should be able to handle the chemical itself pretty well

Ya 25b does last a little longer but if you have done 25i in those really high doses your ready just hsve the mindset that if you freak out that all is good in everything will pass, though I doubt that will happen XD

I tried it at 750mcg complexed with hpbcd and it was visually as strong as 400mcg of lsd but mentally as strong as 100mcg also had more tremors and overheating that worried me a bit but I drank water and stood in front of a fan. I was still in reality the entire time but everything in my visual field was just going nuts with geometric patterns and trailing colors. I'm really worried about the dosage poll tho because I think complexing with hpbcd really ramps up the effects and may cause overheating or some serotonin toxicity

Wow, half a 1.3 mg tab (complexed with HPBCD I believe) of this stuff was insane. If not my most intense trip (at least on the visual & auditory side of things) ever, then close to it. Rainbows constantly exploding in my vision was one of the most prominent features. It was almost too much to handle for a couple of hours, and lasted a long time too. I was still having insane difficulty sleeping at around 12 hours after taking the blot.

Wowzers, 600ug, and then 18mg 2ce, I'll explain later but I'm very impressed ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Well I started out with 600ug of 25b sublingually and 18mgs 2ce IN, and when I snorted the 2ce that's when things really took off, nothing too deep mentally just focusing on how amazing the body high was and how beautiful everything was, so about 3 hours later I took another 600ug of 25b and throughout the rest of the night took a couple more bumps of 2ce ranging from 8-10mgs, and then took 800ug of 25c, at this point I was turned into an electric puddle of psychedelic goop, I cant even begin to explain how amazing the body high was and how absurd the visuals were, This trip and a trip I had involving dpt and mxe are easily the most intense trips I've ever had. Visually I could not focus on anything, everything was a mess of rainbow hexagons swirling around into a into a whirlpool like pattern and would suck you up into it then spit you back out only to repeat the process again and again, everything around me was dancing and morphing into the most neon cartoon rockos modern life, like figures.


As for the body high, for at least the majority of the trip which lasted from around 9pm to 4pm before I went to sleep, I was laying down just rolling about in complete ecstasy, the vibrations were so perfect and on point, It felt like I was a slinky being wiggled about in slow motion. And It felt like I was in a vortex underneath a bunch of helicopters and the windy vibration were just orgasmic, I remember thinking "who the hell is flying all these helicopters around at 2 in the morning" Needless to say there were no helicopters flying around my living room that night. 


And what surprised me most is there was not one minute of physical discomfort or body load during the whole trip. No nausea, no elevated heart rate, my hands did get a tab bit cold so there may have been some vasoconstriction but nothing bothersome. A couple swigs of vodka and about 2mgs of etizolam were taken during the night but sleep came surprisingly easy. In fact when I woke up the next day, I was still having visuals but was taking little cat naps the whole day. I should note that walking became difficult at time but not impossible. All in all this trip was amazing but I'd recommend doing a combination like this in the comfort of your own home or in a controlled environment, I couldn't imagine doing this is a public setting.

So I've now had around 5 or 6 experiences with 25b.  Here's a list of observations to contribute to this fine online pool of knowledge.


1. It gives me the best visuals of any psychedelic I've taken, outside of stuff like DMT. Surfaces on walls and ceilings are always shifting with color.  Staring at a visualizer is intensely entrancing.  The best thing about B is for sure the visuals and a sense of confused wonder at stuff around you.

2. Worst thing is the body load, terrible body load.  First, I can't eat on it, but it doesn't suppress my appetite.  I get very aware that my stomach is empty towards the end of the trip.  Combine that with an overall weird body buzz this drug delivers and it can make for a pretty uncomfortable experience.  I find weed actually helps with most of the body problems, though.  Just have some bud around. 

3. It's the dumbest psychedelic, and I don't mean that in a bad way.  I very much enjoy staring off into space for hours on end, but I just feel so non-functional on it.  My brain just seems to stop working.  It's good because it seems to kill a lot of anxiety for me.  If I ever get paranoid or anxious, I'm probably gonna forget all about it the next moment anyway.

4. Oh yeah, back to weed.  Smoke weed on this.  Smoke a lot.  If you're a regular smoker and worried about conservation, just be conservative for a few days.  I love to smoke endlessly on this stuff.  It really enhances the visuals.  Most of the time weed will amp up some of the head space of the trip, but with NBOME I find its best application is with visuals.

5. I have taken up to 2000ug before, but this was a day after dosing on it for the first time, and I'm pushing 300, so my dosage info is pretty skewed.  I didn't notice much difference at this higher dose, but I'll probably try it again when I haven't indulged in a few weeks.

7. People hate on this shit too much cause they're expecting it to be LSD.  Well, it's not.  Nothing is.  That's what makes acid awesome.  This stuff provides a much more shallow experience, but one that can still be enjoyable and meaningful.

I liked it, very visual, but not long lasting 30 min to an hour. :D

Not recommending to do it in ppublic places cos it is really hard to control ur self.

^30 minutes to an hour? What was your ROA? 


I've found the duration of my 25B tabs to be 10-12 hours. At least, that's how long it takes to fall asleep. The tail end hours are not very psychedelic, mostly residual stimulation with some CEVs.

Too bad this stuff is going out of style this month due to the US federal ban. I recently had my first (very positive) experience with it. I started the day with about 40 mg MXE (20 equiv to someone without tolerance). A couple hours later I took 1 600 microgram pink panther blotter with buccal method. An hour later was brave and took a second blotter, but in my unscientific attempt to only extract half the dose I rubbed it around for half the time then spit it out. With an hour of the second dose my head space was the typically clear NBOMEy feeling- tuned for receptive activity. The vibratory buzz felt vital and resonated stronger with the right stimulation, like harmonic signals and rhythmic ripples. Thoughts, words and conceptual images flowed fluidly while rippling throughout my cortex and triggering different sensory channels. Audio and visual hallucinations from the interference patters created rich twirls and wicked large phase waves. The body buzz was pretty high frequency, very regular and had an almost sharp symmetry which was pleasing aesthetically as it created deep imagery patterns downstream. I rocked that buzz pretty consist for awhile as I focused my intention to it.Suprisingly, it kinda felt like a good strong MXE buzz, but it had been at least 4 hours since I'd taken any, so I dunno. 


The next day I felt great, the clear and motivated buzz returned with just a little MXE.

It's interesting you choose the word buzz, as with 25B I feel like my entire visual field is vibrating or shaking near and during the peak.

Finally got to try this one and I enjoyed it. The euphoria was very pronounced, music sounded incredible, and it just felt like a clean fun ride. Similar to 2-cb in some regards. 25C is still my favorite but 25B is a close second for sure.

Quick tolerance question: 


Last Friday I took 1.2mg 25C (it was lovely!). This Friday I am planning on taking 25B with a friend. I brought a 1.3mg tab for us to share. Half a tab (well, it was a different print but from the same vendor) had me absolutely floored! This time I'm thinking of taking 2/3rds of the tab and giving the other 1/3 to my friend. Does this sound about right?

Yes, but even this amount could be strong for your friend.  The amount you have will surely be strong, but will be lessened because of tolerance.  In the future, wait 3 weeks between all NBOME trips at the very least.  You'll thank me for this.  Personally I wouldn't do NBOMEs more than a few times per year at the most.

I've taken a 3rd of a tab of 25B (~430ug) before from this vendor and the trip was very positive and not overwhelming. She is smaller than me, but she is pretty experienced with psychedelics, so I'm not too worried. 


Usually I put at least two, if not three weeks between trips, and that's a rule I try to stick by as much as possible. But these trips are taking place during special occasions (like right now I'm visiting a friend in New Orleans), so I'm making the exception.

I've only had one experience with 25b-NBOMe thus far, but it is easily my favorite of the NBOMe's I've tried (25b, 25i, 25c). Sampled a 1mg tab sublingual with a friend of mine whom had the same dosage and route. Come up was quick and intense but never mentally overwhelming. The OEV's and CEV's were very strong but my mindstate was calm throughout. I've lost most of my interest with rc's but this is one of the few I wouldn't mind sampling again.

Such an AMAZING reaction for me tonight. Fuck me the music is still flashing colors.

excuse me while I experience these effects for awhile...


Edit- The next day: Dosage: One 600mcg blotter buccal ROA. Roughed up my gums a touch with my finger and then rubbed the blotter all over the top gums until it became a thoroughly soggy blotter and then swallowed it. Took two hours to really get happening, but hit more directly than I expected for the dose. I have used 25b once about a month ago (report is on this page). Combined with cannabis and tobacco primarily.


As someone said earlier, it's a clean fun ride. It is also my clear favorite of the 25x variations that I have sampled (i/c/b/g). It had a lot of depth, an abundance of energy, overall very versatile, like adaptable enough to find a good flow whatever was going on in the environment. The sensory crossings were far out! I felt the music by the light that the sound made, among other consciousness salad bowls. With other 25x compounds I have noticed a tinge of discomfort hidden within the wave but felt nothing of the sort today.


What a nice afterglow!

So. I bought a sheet of 25B (spongebob tabs!) that the vendor claimed had 1.3mg on each tab, and also that the tabs were complexed with HPBCD. 


Well, I get the tabs, and the vendor was kind enough to include a few free Jerry Garcia blotters. I ask him what they are and he tells me they're the same thing. Lovely! 


We take the free tabs first. Half a tab each (so 650ug) had us absolutely *floored* for hours -- incredible rainbow OEVs, sound enhancement, and never really mentally threatening. The half tab also made me vomit during the comeup, and throughout the trip I was amazed that someone would put this much on a tab. Although I was not worried at the dose we took, I felt like this intensity could cause seizures or other health complications if we had taken even a full tab. 


Recently, I moved onto the spongebob tabs. I end up taking about 3/4th of a tab because I wanted to overcome some tolerance. The trip was pretty underwhelming, but I attributed that to having taken 25C a week prior.

So 13 days after that trip, I try a full tab with some friends who had no tolerance. Even at this dose, we all agreed that we could have easily handled more. And perhaps more importantly, I didn't feel that seizure potential with these tabs.


So my question is...what gives? I know it would be pure speculation, but I'm curious as to what you guys think. 

Maybe he put too much on the Jerry Garcia tabs? Or the complexing was more successful?

From what I have read the 25x series has a long lived tolerance. 


Uneven distribution could be a factor. 


Also the matter of absorption could be playing a part.


Could be one or some combination of these.

Axed, the most likely explanation is that the Jerry tabs are higher dose than Spongebob. If they are the same dose, the next likely explanation is the long tolerance as mentioned. I waited a full month between my 25b doses and tripped harder on 600 mcg than I did a month earlier with more than 600 mcg (it was the same 'pink panther' tabs). So given that experience there must be a lot of factors we aren't aware of that affect the strength of the trip. Set and setting are big factors obviously, but yeah I would definitely recommend a full MONTH between doses. 2 weeks may not be enough with 25b.

Probably took too much. When I took half of a tab (so it was supposed to be 650ug -- see my post above for more info), it was very intense, and I felt the seizure potential with higher doses. 

I hope he has a speedy recovery!

I have documented on multiple occasions that in certain scenarios in at least one individual the duration of induced effects can be over 24 hours. This can occur at doses less than 500ug sublingualy and seemingly spontaneously after previously successful exposure. 

This chemical appears to be capable of extending its half life through suppression of hepatic and/or renal elimination processes. I fear in such a scenario (in high enough doses) it could last several days and build up to a potentially fatal level. 


WARNING: 25B-NBOME DOESN'T APPEAR WORTH IT AND MIGHT BE LETHAL WITHIN THE CURRENT ACCEPTED THERAPEUTIC DOSE RANGE IN A PERFECT STORM SCENARIO.


Can anyone else corroborate this?

When I wrote this^ I was 24 hours into a 200ug sublingual dose I had an idiosyncratic reaction to. Two days in the trip was still very obvious and not pleasant. I successfully terminated the experience with 10mg of 4-aco-det. I don't fully understand why this happened or why the 4-aco-det terminated the trip. A review of the literature showed  a similar situation had been previously documented.


"(with 1.6 mg[of racemic doi]) The general nature of the experience was depressing, with a sad view of life. There was no way I could connect with my emotions. Even my sadness was vague. At about the ninth hour I decided that enough was enough, and this strangely disappointing about-plus-two was aborted with 125 micrograms of LSD. The emotions became present and living within a half hour. I was greatly relieved. The erotic was not a mechanical attempt but a deeply involved feeling with an archetype of orgasm easily available. It was shaped like a flower, richly colored, with an unusual "S" shape to it. This was a lovely end to a difficult day."

Thinking of combing 4-AcO-DMT with a 25B (I have ~1.2mg tabs). I'm doing the combo mostly for a longer trip overall. Thoughts on duration and timing?


EDIT: If anyone was wondering, I tripped absolute balls from this combo.

I've had a single 375 ug 25B-NBOMe blotter hanging around for a few years and think I'll get around to doing it some time soon, I'm just not sure how worthwhile this dose will be.

I enjoyed 25I at 600 ug, my only trip with it; very beautiful visuals, humorous but not very interesting head space. I've also tried 25C at 375 ug (slight euphoria and colour saturation, not much else positive) and 750 ug (much more visual, euphoric and anxiety-free thanks to etizolam).While I've found these doses enjoyable, I also found them lacking to certain degrees and wouldn't mind upping the dose.

I just found a report of a death from 25B-NBOMe on Erowid ( [https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=103021](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=103021) ). Very tragic report, I feel terribly for the family. I thought it was pretty important that the author noted that he and his brother had taken 3 tabs of the same batch prior to the tragedy, with no ill effects. Goes to show that inconsistency in blotter strength can result fatally, or that this compound is extremely unpredictable.

Yeah I came here to post pretty much the same...


As I have been saying for a while: I don't trust these compounds, the toxic potential is a "black swan" i.e. an unknown (unforeseen) unknown type of factor. Until we at least understand why these compounds can be dangerous I don't see why I shouldn't just stick to the many many other wonderful psychedelics in our arsenal. And I don't see why others shouldn't either.

I have experimented with this chemical extensively. A couple months ago I had an idiosyncratic response involving sub-lingual administration. I noticed what appeared to be an extended duration trailing off over several days. I had never noticed this previously. I discontinued use. 


Recently I decided to consume this chemical and document my reaction. The trip report can be found here: [http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/718880-25B-NBOMe-400ug-An-Unintended-Physical-Reaction](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/718880-25B-NBOMe-400ug-An-Unintended-Physical-Reaction) l. I repeated this a few days later with about the same dose and the same thing happened again. A short period of intense visuals followed by several days of confusion, tendency towards panic attacks, and blurred vision. Upon closer inspection I noticed the fog I was experiencing in my vision was intensely psychedelic when I would focus. When I stopped focussing and would continue my daily activities this would subside to an amorphous undulating fog  of blurred vision. 


This chemical has a high lipopholicity (logP ~3.84) which makes me wonder if what I am experiencing is a bi-phasic half life. A short distribution phase (probably into lipids) I interpret as a psychedelic trip. This might be followed by a much longer phase of slow elimination I perceive as less intense psychedelic visual fog, this phase appears representative of the terminal elimination half-life. This could explain why people using 25x-NBOMe more than once every few weeks require greater doses and why the tolerance last longer than other psychedelics. I am uncertain in regards to why I didn't notice this second longer phase the first dozen times I consumed this chemical. I guess I was incapable of recognizing the subtle details and overlooked this. This is only a theory.


I have found some benefits from this chemical. Their might be therapeutic effects in regards to it, probably requiring lower than psychedelic doses. The few positives I have experienced are outweighed by the negatives. I haven't had access to LSD in over half a decade and will probably never have access again. My previous experience with LSD and evidence from others show LSD is much more enjoyable, safer, and has many of the same benefits. I was once hopeful and optimistic the NBOMe series would be a safe, valuable, and enjoyable substitute for the therapeutic effects I once received from LSD. I did experience some minor therapeutic effects, these were overwhelmed by the negative effects. My youthful faith and optimism was misplaced. America is a country in crisis and it's irrational and inhumane drug policies are a manifestation of the magnitude of its social problems. Uncle Sam would much rather people have a chemical that causes death, psychosis, and almost guaranteed failure when used therapeutically rather than LSD. I learned an important and identity crushing lesson about the nature of the country l live in.


I don't plan to use this chemical again and recommend others don't use this chemical either.


If you have hopes in regards to the beauty of LSD or its potential they are justified. If you believe the NBOMe chemicals currently available are a substitute your optimism is naive. In the name of social stability in a time of crisis a human life is insignificant relative to an ant in America. The drug laws of this country are representative of this.

Compounds like this shit and NBOH's removed staple canadian vendor compounds because of some guys from here ordering that nbome and nboh shit in.


Thankfully I have some 2c-E and 2c-b-fly safely stashed, but they are now illegal, after being legal for 17 years since their apparition on the first canadian vendor.


You motherfuckers don't know what you've done! First you promote something on blotter, tell people it's LSD, people take 3 blotter, dont have a linear LSD dosage like increase in intensity but a ³ intensity and side effect profile which have resulted in deaths., I can't think of a single death from 2c-x, except the famous early 2000's 2c-t-7 snorting disaster.

@FunctionalOlfactio


Great report, the lipophilic activity that makes the thing last 2-3 days resembles a little what people who would eat their PCP here get on, PCP is higly lipophilic too and some psychedelia and strangeness remained for at least 3 days after sometimes depending on the dose, 20mg will def do that.


And yes, everytime I try to trip now I end up thinking that my country that used to be thought of the Switzerland of the Americas (Canada) is now, less so since late 2015, but is also a bringer of torture (I should have said death, we don't actually torture, but if I could put in that song title in there I would heh. Anyways, lysergamide related to LSD are the answer, fuck nbomes and nboh's.

Yeah, DOI sucked ass indeed. Don't care it's gone, although I only have 40mg of 2c-I left in my safe. I love how Shulgin was always so lucky to have his wife have sex with him when trying those compounds with him almost every time. I never had a kaleidoscopic orgasm with my previous girlfriend who was both heavily into psychs with me at the time, when she left me, it hurt so bad I start slamming not DPT but hydromorphone to kill the pain. Anyway, i've had very nice CEV's when climaxing though, the flower thing I could see a couple of times this way, the fractal of life I guess.

Hi,


I've aquired a nasalspray of  25b-NBOMe @ 150ug/s. I have quite some experience with 25e-NBOH and 25i-NBOMe nasally. Both are extremely fun and visual but everytime I use it I can't really enjoy it to the max because i'm scared of the side effects. 700ug 25i nasally is the max I go. Extreme visuals with entities OEV and CEV. Last trip i've seen shit like Hulk hogan on a flamingo wearing a sombrero. Now i've read that 25b-NBOMe is even more visual, but also much more potent. With 25i I usually start with three sprays (450ug), and never exceed 700ug. 


What's the dosing range on 25b. I'm thinking of starting with 150ug and maybe titrate up to 450ug max, but also a tad bit scared for potential side effects.

I have done it but it has been many, many years, as this isn't really available anymore. It is more potent by weight than 25i-nbome...


But I think you are on the right track with that... 150ug still isn't much of a dose so you probably won't have much effect from that. I used to take 700-1000ug, but only after I became comfortable with the compound. Wanna say I started with 300-400ug.

Every time I use a NBOMe or NBOH during the peak I freak out because I get extreme visuals, so many visuals that I wonder if I didn't accidently sprayed a couple of non dissolved milligrams in my nose and will die of vasoconstriction. I'll just start low and get used to it and work my way up.


NBOMe visuals are crazy, one of the best. Sadly that it's such a sketchy compound, but i'm fairly sure there's no harm to be done under the 1 milligram range. I' probably won't even exceed 700ug.

Personally I've never had trouble with the compounds, and I have taken them in pretty massive doses and all manner of ROA. 


It does suck that there have been those handful of deaths attributed to the class, but those handful of cases have never caused me enough worry to actually be concerned while tripping on them. As long as you are absolutely careful in your preparation and administration, you should be good.

I've had once on 25e-NBOH that i thought I was bleeding out of my pores due to vasoconstriction. Which obviously isn't possible. But the thought of it gave me red riverstreams visuals accross my whole body which looked like blood. This is a thing that keeps occuring with this psychedelic group. It's my mind tricking itself and it's hard to calm myself down. 


Funny enough I have close to no headspace on 200mgs+ DPT and have done plenty of 5-MeO-DMT without a problem but on this "eyecandy" compound I tend to freak out. But it's a beautifull chem tho.

Yeah, I mean it is quite physically activating, but I found the NBOH's carry a lot less physical side effects. But they are just so visually stimulating that it does feel very intense. 25b-NBOH I have taken up to I believe 1.6mg nasal, and known someone to take 2.2mg nasally, and it's gone well.


25i-nbome, someone once prepared for me what I believe was about 1.5mg in an injection. That was a wild time and some of the most intense visuals ever. I think I still prefer the 25b-versions though.


My first couple times with them I had some physical discomfort for sure. But once I grew to understand how they worked, it didn't bother me as much.


But the NBOH compounds are def better imo. A lot more refined.

I've only had 25e-NBOH in a nasal spray. I had a extreme bad trip on that. Small TLDR


Worked my way up to 1mg nasally. Visuals were so crazy, DMT breakthrough style. Was fine untill I got extreme vasoconstriction which tricked my mind into thinking I was bleeding out of my pores. I just couldn't keep my head clear but think I was bleeding. The visuals even turend red. Called my GF and buddies to check on to me but no one answered. 30-45 min later I went in the shower because I've read here that someone survived a DOC OD because he took a hot shower. And I also though if i'm really bleeding (which i couldn't see because of the visuals), I'd be more clear with water streaming down. About 5min in the shower I hear like 5 police car sirenes and a lot of ambulance sirens and I start to freak out because I thought they came for me since I thought I was dying. But I didn't call them, or did I? Maybe my friends called, who knows.


So I get out of the shower and look out of my window and the whole street is filled with cops/ambulance and like 300 people. IT was around 11pm in a village so there's usually no one around at that time. I freak out not knowing what's going on. Eventually I think, let's just go downstairs and see whatsupp. If i'm really bleeding there are atleast ambulances here to help me. I was fullblown peaking and my parents we're downstairs so it was kinda scary. Apparently there was a dead body found in the lake across my house. So I end up seeing the police/ambulances, parents and neighbors etc while full blown tripping. Eventually when they went I away and I went back to my room and had a decent after trip because I knew nothing was going on.


Ever since that trip everytime with a NBOMe and NBOH I get very scared that's I'll die of vasoconstriction. Even when I never exceed 700ug anymore (nasally tho, might be more potent). I've done quite a lot of psychedelics known to man. Have about hundred of DMT/DPT/5-MeO-DMT trips under my belt and never had a bad trip, only with these substances. But oh boy what are they visually beautiful. The duration nasally is also awesome. Using a nasal spray to spray yourself into crazy visuals also has it charmes. Wondering what 25b-NBOMe will offer me.

Close to no headspace on 200mg DPT??

How much have you dabbled with NBOx? I heard they cause massive tolerance

I'm a weird one. I never get headspace. Only 5-MeO-DMT gives me insane headspace, and regular DMT some, but nothing crazy. Couple of weeks ago I tried 4,5g shrooms for the first time. Close to zero headspace and almost no visuals. Three weeks later I've tried 50mg 4-AcO-DMT, same thing. I'm done with psilos.


I never trip back to back, always wait two weeks so i've not experienced tolerance. But I dose nasally in a nasal spray and if I redose 1 to 2 hours in I don't notice instant tolerance. IIRC phenethylamines are usually very easy on the tolerance spectrum. Stuff like 2C-B you can do back to back without a problen.

The issue is with the way nBOME/NBOH binds to the receptor as strongly and selectively as it does. This is what causes it to create lasting tolerance unlike most other psychedelics. 2C-B does not have the same receptor affinity as 25B-NBOH and that goes for the nBOME variant as well. You can't really compare the effect on tolerance from a drug in the 2C-x family to one of these they are working in a different pharmacological manner due to their affinity. That being said I really wanna experiment with 25B-NBOH in light doses sublingually it sounds...interesting and safe if your very careful with dosage.

Well like I said I can't spreak from day to day tolerance. But intra the trip redosing nasally surely does work without tolerance issues.


Seems like i'm sadly enough not getting the 25b-NBOMe anymore. Maybe one day, but I doubt I can find powder anywhere since I cba working with blotters. Speaking of 25b-NBOH, that's a chem i've never seen here in europe. I have 25e-NBOH in a nasal spray and a 25c-NBOH blotter laying around which I got from a friend but the rest of the NBOH series i've never seen. I'd like to experience i/c/b-NBOH.


I also happen to have a nasal spray of 2C-B-FLY-NBOMe which I got from a friend. But tbh that chemical seems to obscure that i'm not sure if I want to try it.

If you ever try  2C-B-FLY-NBOMe i'd love to hear a trip report. I have some as well and never tried it. 2CB-FLY gives me massive nausea above 12mg. I like 25b-NBOH though...
