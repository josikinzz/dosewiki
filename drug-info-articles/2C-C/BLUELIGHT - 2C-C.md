2C-C is, for me, milder, less visual, and shorter lasting than 2C-B. It is also less stimulating, it has more of a relaxed, stony high. Doses are a fair bit higher, at least 50%. Anything else you want to know?

if i were to take some 2c-b tonight and possible molly as well - when would be okay to try out some 2c-c without having any tolerance issues?  I know taking mdma and then taking it say the next day or even 2 days from then is not so great etc

Leave it a week I'd say. Tolerance fades quickly, and you could trip again tomorrow (it's not like with MDMA, the effects will be diminished, but they'll be pretty much the same, just weaker at a given dose), but you'll get most out of it if you wait until tolerance diminishes entirely.

So after trying 2c-c a couple weeks ago and being somewhat disappointed with the whole experience, or lack there of decided to try 50mgs yesterday. It took about an hour and a half to come up to what I felt like was its peak. Very light, some colors were enhanced, but no other visual distortions. so at this point I decide to insufflate a 6mg line. and BOOM, bending walls, water like flowing hardwood floors. At this point my pupils were a good deal dilated, less than when rolling on MDMA but still a good amount. The wallpaper in the room I was in has stars on it in an old fashion design and they looked like they were melting and left out in the rain, as if they were running down the wall from being wet. The head space was mostly clear and relaxed and I just sat listened to music and enjoyed looking around at everything. 


I wanted to try and explore some CEV's so i closed the blinds on the windows and closed my eyes (being in the dark made them much easier to fully dive into). I got mostly soft wavy lines of all different colors slowly morphing and moving into really nice patterns. after doing this for some time I opened my eyes and went online for a bit, the trip was coming to an end and most of the effects had worm off at this point. The whole trip lasted maybe 4 hours with an hour or 2 of after effects.


I would say for me this is getting close to an ideal dose. I would probably try 55 or 60mgs next time and see if that takes away the need for a little bump up the nose near the peak. Although many people get stronger effects from less, its just not there for me. I did start low with only 28mgs my first time and worked up from there and would suggest people looking to try this do the same as it seems to have a very wide dosage range across people who try it out and get many different effects.

My favorite 2C has a sequel thread! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Make sure you give it a fair shot before giving up on this one.

65-70mg is my favorite dose.

*low whistle* Doses for this one seem to be slowly approaching 2C-D over the course of the last 9 years... (Anyone else notice that's how long the last B&D was up?) 40 was good for me, not sure if I would up next time or not. It's so...simplistic, going higher doesn't really intrigue me. It's just a good, lazy-afternoon proto-psychedelic. 25C-NBOMe was much more interesting, mentally. The visuals were pretty similar, though.

Probably because people are trying to get to a +++ on it or something.

60 mg and up doses of 2c-c are amazing.... i wish someone would just go ahead and synth a huge amount of it. 

i've always thought that the reason that 2c-c isn't very popular was down to the dosage: its very high so the economics of it is absurd in comparison to, say DOC or now 25C-NBOMe. but there is also quite a lot of variability in the experience. and there is the possibility of it making you sleepy.


personally, i'm still surprised that there isn't a lot of demand for it. its an easy to use psychedelic with a fairly linear dose-response curve from 20 to 60 mg, rarely causes an uncomfortable body sensation or intense anxiety... for me its what i imagine when people describe candyflipping. perhaps 2c-b accomplishes all this at a lower dosage. i couldn't say.


with regards to the varying dosage: i think there may have been some 2C-D circulated under the name of 2C-C. or there are salts of 2c-c that vary greatly in potency by weight.

i dunno. but i do know that I have had 3 samples of 2C-C and one is much more potent than the other two. (guess i could get some marquis reagent ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png))

Third time dosing was 35mg. Still haven't gotten "there" yet. Slowly getting a better idea of what it is like. Effects took less than 2 hours to develop. I was in an excited state. Not much of a trip... It felt more like a methylone type buzz. I was very chill, but awake, and mildly euphoric. Me and my friends (who also dosed 35mg) played risk all night long. It was fun for the mood we were in. 


Next time I am going to push the dose up to 50mg. I like 2c-c's subtle character. I am curious to know if it has the same character at higher doses. 


I feel as though doses between 25-35mg is good for social settings. I have fun interacting with friends at this dose.

Food for thought - If you are only barely feeling it at 35mg, I suspect you'll eventually find what you want in that 60-70mg range. The dose/response curve is more linear and predictable than some of the more potent chems. Have fun. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

ive barely ever had  sample of 2c-c and i didnt even take barely half of the sample just to test it out - i was actually able to consume a rather large beer on it and felt great - it wasnt anything near 2c-b however it was defnitely a mood changer for the positive and i could see it being much more sparkly and visual with a higher dose so i feel 35-40mg would be a good dose to start at and see.

The first time I had it I had 40mg and I tripped far more than I thought I would so for anyone thinking to try it remember to start with low doses!

So how's the nausea with this one?  (Mostly asking people who DO get nausea from mescaline or other phenethylamine psychedelics).  I have a little 2C-C on hand and am getting curious to try it but cannot handle nausea in any form.  Never done any 2C-x's for this very reason.  I don't get sick from MDMA/MDA phens but get ungodly nausea from mescaline.

nausea happens for me on 2ce mostly, less so on 2c i, and least on 2c d/c/b. staggering the dose might help with nausea though, as it helps me overcome the awfulness of some amt comeups (basically take the dose you want over a larger period of time, say 20-40 mins).

I had no nausea with this and neither did anyone I gave it too. If you insuffulate it you might feel a little weird on the the comeup but its not nasuea, and the feeling goes away if you go for a walk.

I have a little 2C-C on hand and am getting curious to try it but cannot handle nausea in any form.  Never done any 2C-x's for this very reason.  I don't get sick from MDMA/MDA phens but get ungodly nausea from mescaline.

I get extremely nauseous from almost every phenethylamine psychedelic. 2c-c and 25i-nbome are among the two that have never given me nausea when orally/buccally dosed (respectively). I was able to take up to 100mg of 2c-c without getting the least bit nauseous - truly a remarkable phen.

I've recently attempted to snort 23mg of 2C-C mostly to see if I could trip intensely for a very short duration. However, my nose produced an unusual amount of mucous after insufflation, which instantly converted most of the 2C-C into a nasal drip that I spat out in order to avoid oral absorption. Strange, because this does not usually happen when I snort 2C-I, 2C-E or 2C-P. I ended up tripping only very slightly. Has anybody else had similar problems snorting 2C-C? Is there any possible solution to this problem?

Stick it in your butt. For most drugs this is the solution to insufflation side effects. It makes for less risk to your sense of smell and often also makes for an improvement in effects (potency wise). I don't know why so many people who are willing to accept the increased risks of insufflation act like "it's gross" or "that's just not something I do" are rational reasons not to. Whenever "just so" reasons are given it's a cue that there is no good justification or something is being hidden. There's always a way to stick something in your butt if you're industrious. Sure, sometimes you're out and about, it comes up spontaneously, and insufflation is the only option, but for the most part it's all excuses for social/sexual insecurity and being afraid of your own butt hole. It's high time men of science liberated their ass holes, and we call out the assholes who insist, directly or indirectly, that there's something wrong with rectal administration (Even if posters simply say, in one way or another, "I don't do it," why do they bother to say so in so many situations when they're not asked? It's because they're scared assholes afraid of ass holes who want you to be assholes like them, so fuck them in their ass holes ... fuckin assholes).

How many mg did you dose, hb?


Any factors that may have contributed to the anxiety / headache? Stress? Allergies? 


or Do you think it was mores the 2c-c that made you feel that way?


What have your past experiences been like? Dosage ranges? How many times have you used 2c-c?

i guess my point is more that you can't expect it to remain side effect free after you've done it a few times.

perhaps you've even noticed this with mushrooms? for me and many other the first 1 or 2 times are completely great and anxiety-free. but then trip 3 or 4, even if all doses are separated by many months, might feel strange and uncomfortable. simply because your brain has adapted to this once novel experience.

in my experience this is true of individual drugs as well as of broad classes of drugs.


sorry psychedelics don't give you consistent results ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


here's a story for your trouble:

the most i've ever taken is 80 mg.

unlike every time i had taken it before, the comeup was really rough. eventually i could do nothing but sit motionless with my eyes closed.

i had some music playing and at some point i noticed i was really really really really liking it.

i started to feel euphoric. 

i opened my eyes. i felt awful.

i laid down and closed my eyes again and lay euphorically appreciative of music for the rest of the night. no CEVs no OEVs. at some point i became consumed in an uncontrollable fit of laughter over nothing .

55mg is the most I've done, and it was a bit too much for me. I spent the peak being completely distracted and just sitting in a chair feeling confused.


35mg is my usual dose, I can have lots of funny thought-streams going off in my head while still staying engaged with the outside world. I get very interested in concepts of dualism, doubling, duplication, doppelgangers, etc. I often think that it's encoded in the name, 2C-C, which has a 2 and 2 Cs..."to see, see!" Once I took some and went for a walk around my block. Before I left, I checked my mailbox and took out a newspaper and a piece of junk mail. When I came back, I checked my mailbox again, and found an identical copy of the same newspaper and the same piece of junk mail. I couldn't believe it! Silly mailman. :D

Yesterday I dosed 40 mg 2C-C oral. Some nausea was present but not too disturbing. From T+0:30 slight empathogenic effects were noted and from T+1:00 there were some tracers, but no other visual effects. I couldn't distinguish it with a low dose of 2C-B except for the tracers. Nitrous caused me to have slight visuals and an overall feeling of awesomeness for about 1-2 minutes. 

At T+2:15 I decided that I wanted a more heavy trip and insufflated 20 mg. The burn was just as intense compared to 2C-B and was tolerable. Within two minutes I was in a very trippy mindstate comparable to about 10-15 mg 2C-B insufflated and got intense visuals completely different from 2C-B. There were overwhelming moving geomatric patterns on the walls and CEV's were amazing. Plateau was reached in about 20 minutes and it took 2 hours for the effects to subside. No hangover.

I've been looking to combine 2c-c, or 2c-i with mdma this weekend. I've found a lot of posts/dosage recommendations and trip reports for a 2c-i combination, but none for 2c-c and mdma. Can anyone chime in about this? Experiences? If 2c-c is a better combination or if 2c-i would be better (would be taking at an event), and what dosage would be recommended.

Be aware that 2C-X and MDMA synergize each other quite a lot - I learned this the hard way by talking 110 mg MDMA + 50 mg 2C-C (i.e. two full doses). Not very pleasant.

Quite quickly after returning to baseline. 1-2 hours approx. This is a very chilly compound, laid-back and mellow. I would almost call it sedating.

lolol i think dude wants to know how long the tripping lasts.


also, @stormcharger: i find it strange that you felt that your experience would be relevant here. You just recently posted in another thread about how easy you find it to sleep on LSD... you are clearly in the minority in that thread. what make you think your subjective experience of this drug is more universal?


it is useful for you to report your individual experience as such. out of many subjective experiences we can find more universally-applicable patterns.

but to suggest that your individual experience is predictive of another person's subjective experience is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. 

instead, report your experiences for all to enjoy. and when your are attempting to help others, point to trends that you have noticed in the aggregate data.


I'm really not mad at stormcharger. i just found his post to be a particularly good example of some of the less thoughtful posting that goes on here in PD.

Hi 


Someone recently got a few mg of 2C-C and is asking himself of how's the best dose for a beginner with this rc and rc's in general. One time 2C-B was used, snorted, two lines, the dosage is unknown, the lines were easy to insufflate, burned a bit.


He did make a allergie test with 1mg or less of 2C-C. He would suggest a starting dose of 4-6 mg insufflated to get a very mild high to test. what do the experienced users of this substance think of that? 


thank you for you suggestions, insight and help

Someone I know thinks that snorting is a horrible way to take this drug, and that referring to himself in the first person is the most sensible way of writing a forum post.

It's OK, it's just that it makes it easier to read posts, so you'll get more responses. We don't do SWIM or anything here, if you're not willing to talk about having done something in the first person, then don't talk about it. Welcome, btw. How much 2C-C do you have? Snorting is efficient, but it's just so horrifically painful that it's not worth it IMO.

Ok I fully understand and will respect that. thank you for pointing that out and welcoming me ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have 100mg but I dont intend to use all of it. I have experienced snorting 2C-B and it wasnt that painful at all. It is to mention that I do not have much experience with snorting drugs. I did some amphetamine but thats it (only one or two times) and like I said, 2C-B one time. I think snorting is the way which I favor the most with this drug. Isnt it like that, that if you use the oral method (I think to wrap it in a paper or something like that) you need more material? 


I intend to safer use, so I am likely to test it with a small dose and get higher the next time (after a week or more). 


What do you think about that?

Im not sure if 4-6mg would do much, but it hurts a fuck ton just have it orally its not worth it unless you are running low.

I don't know how hard you want to trip but typically I think that snorting 2Cs roughly triples their potency. For me 60 mg 2C-C orally is a chill trip and I can easily push it to 85 and still have a really good cognizant time. I've never heard of anyone freaking out under 25ish mgs orally so you should probably be fine on 8 to start and then work up from there.

Hey guys


so I recently was out and my friend and I thought we try it out. 

We took 30-35 mg oral. We had a very different trip but we had a really great time. 


So the situation was like this: 

We were out and having a good time in a bar, we sipped two beers and after that we went for a walk to the next club. My friend hasn't eat much before and me had a cheeseburger right before the bar. I took my share before we left, my friend short after we left the bar. on the way to the club we smoked some weed and we both felt something, but we werent sure if its the mix of beer and weed or if it was the 2c-c coming up very smoothly. 

As I havent read anything about a pushing effects we decided to take some amphetamine, just a line for both of us. Then we went to the club, feeling very good and laughin all the time. The sound we listened was Goa, so as soon as we got in, the sound punched us in the face. But we both felt perfectly good.. somewhat like on mdma, but not that intensive and deep. We drank some beer and were dancing. Then we went out for a smoke, or better to smoke some weed. 


There the 2C-C showed what it got. It was awesome. (fyi I never tried LSD, my friend did) we were sitting on the floor and smoking, and I felt that the room was disorted, the floor had little hills although it was flat and so on. Then I asked my friend how he felt. And he started to smile very hard. Then he told me that the flash was sort like LSD optics. he saw all move and to gently dissolve and so on. We both laughed so hard in that moment and felt so goooooooood. I hadnt that much optics.. in the club, I ussualy saw stairs and abysses or walls but there werent there. I sometimes felt clear in my mind and catched me starring at something and thinking, wooow im flashed. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)))) We both got have reach the plateau then I think. After that, I held about 2-3 hours and then went away smoothly. I didnt really realized it, at the end I asked my friend or myself are we still high or not? both of us didnt had the urge to get more, or other drugs or anything. And you did not have to fight with any emotional stuff... you just were happy and having a good time with some optics and tummyache because of the laughing :D 


It was just beautiful and I can say for myself, I will try it again. 


The next time I will try with a bit more, as I did not reach that high as my friend, and he said it was just awesome!!!


After the party we went home (8 AM) and we both slept perfectly fine till late of the evening, and before I went to bed I got some breakfast. We both did not have any side effects, except a little headache like when you have drunk too much.


Again:

Dosage: 30-35mg oral 2C-C


2-3mg nasal Amphetamine

some beers

some weed


the coming up was very smooth. took 1 hour or more till we reached the plateau.

Plateau held about 3-4 hours

the coming down was as smooth as the coming up. In that process, sometimes I did not know if it was over or not.

There was no emotional stuff to fight with or something, just the good feeling. 


side-effects: nothing really, besides little headache.


Hope it helps some of you to estimate the risk and value of this rc. Please note, that I do not recommend to use this substance and if you do, please take precautions and do safer use! 


peace out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ Most amazing tracers I have ever seen on any substance as well. There's literally two realities happening at once, one of them a millisecond behind the other one so you see everything before it happens...or so it seems. A classic psychedelic suitable for a variety of situations.

Going to combine 20mg of C with 90 of 4-fa tonight for a concert. Anyone have experience with this particular combo? What do you think about this dose ratio?


Edit: Read Erny's post linked above and have decided to try 10mg instead with the 90 of 4-fa to get a feel for the combo. I'll update here with results, although I suspect it wont be very psychedelic at all.

took 30mg tonight with friend. it was interesting, still is. I noticed a anxiety for myself in the come up. At times i had thoughts of "this is why i was having second thoughts about doing it." high level of this anxiety and body temp changed or illusions. I felt a energy that felt good and the visual was strong. slowing fading over 6 hours but never did it "just end" or cut off,.  The come up might have been an hour of not so fun things, but after the peak it was all worth it. 


I could see trying 40mg next. But i was able to get a fair deal out of this at 30mg ..


from earlier today: Outside listening to birds and how many noises are around, the motor cycle or kids playing and dogs barking. As the birds flew by it looked like a double was flying behind. The refresh rate has changed and thoughts of "the world is like a Mario game but only the pixels are so tiny that we don't see them. The colors were enhanced and patters can be seen but not popping out at you.. Tree tops and skylines are blended and you think about how its all just made up of shapes and we put the label on everything. over all a good experience.

All 5ht2a psychedelics produce significant cross tolerance, yes.

Funny that this thread popped-up. I tried 40mgs 2C-C yesterday and I must say, this is a very nice, easy compound.


For me no bodyload worth mentioning. Some OEVs, some CEVs, little to no mindfuck but physically reminiscent of MDMA. 


Tactile enhancements, general wellbeing and an actual return to baseline within 6 hours. 2C-C doesn't linger so no need for a benzo to sleep.


I liked it a lot!

Recently acquired some of this, planning on trying around 25-30ish over the weekend. I have a mg scale and tried to weigh my dosages to this range. Has anyone had any success with oral dosage and then maybe trying a booster dose if its not enough (5-10 millgrams maybe)? And or has any tried it with a low dose of mxe? 


Some of these dosages just seem so high for a 2c-x chemical. 50 milligrams? Sheesh.


Pretty experienced tripping, but addiction issues had me focusing on other things for a few years. Had a good year and a half break from everything and now occasionally smoke and drink. I have used MXE a few times as well.

Yeah, I only use it orally, yeah most often at 30mg, yeah I've done it with MXE, it's nice, but the MXE tends to kill the visuals a bit for me, so I prefer to wait until the tail end of the trip. Don't expect anything mindblowing, it's a pretty mild chem and 30mg is a pretty low dose. 50mg would be too much 2C-E, a heavy but reasonable dose of 2C-B, and a mild dose of 2C-D. Every drug has its own dosage range.

I usually do around 35mg orally. Anything more than 40 and I get too confused mentally to really enjoy the trip. 20-25 is good for reading a book on.

First time posting on bluelight, hello! 


My question relates to dosage for a first time RC user. I've previously done LSD and shrooms, but never had the opportunity to do an RC. Recently, 2c-c has become available to me which is very rare where I'm from. I can get it in capsules containing 25mgs. So here's my dilemma: From reading through a large amount of the original Big & Dandy 2c-c thread, I gathered that 50mgs may be a bit high for a first time 2c-c user. On the other hand, I'd be pretty bummed if I only took 25mgs and didn't get the full 2c-c experience, since I probably won't get another opportunity to take it for a pretty long time. 


I'm about 210 pounds, I seem to have a naturally high tolerance for the psychedelics I've previously tried, and I will be dosing orally. Also, I should point out that I don't plan on mixing with with other substances except smoking some good ol' marijuana while I'm on it. 


So with all that said, 25mg or 50mg? Thoughts?

If you trust whoever you got it from go for 50mg. 25mg will give you a light, happy buzz. You can always eat 1 and then an hour and a half to 2 hours later once you feel you have come up snort 5mg intervals every 10-15 minutes or so. If you don't wanna snort just go for 2. 


I'd prefer this chem in the 40+mg range.

You say you're worried you won't get another chance to try it for a long time, so don't want to start low because of that.. So why not purchase 75mg? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


It's always good to start low, especially when you're trying something new. If you've already taken a 1mg allergy test dose and no problems arose, you can jump straight in with the remaining 49mg but every person is different, so if you can get 75mg I'd recommend doing so and trying 25mg first, then trying the 50mg dose at least 2 weeks after once your tolerance has lowered.


If you've already got 50mg and can't get any more, then I'd take an allergy test dose of 1mg, wait 24 hours, and if no problems arise, take the rest, since 25mg of 2C-C is likely to be quite underwhelming.

@Jesusgreen: That's a good idea. I had previously considered it, but since I already had the 50mg it seemed more convenient to not get any more. After some more thought though, I'd rather be safe than sorry so I will be starting with the 25 and if it goes smoothly I will look into getting more I can try 50 next time around. 


On the topic of the allergy test, I've never heard much about it other than what I have read in this thread. Obviously, the purpose of the test is to make sure your body doesn't react negatively (and unexpectedly) to the substance and to confirm exactly what the substance is, but I have some questions: 

-Are allergy tests a "must?" The reason I ask is because I acquired my 50mgs in two capsules of 25 and I'd prefer to avoid having to deal with opening one of the capsules and containing the powder, but if the allergy test is necessary then I will definitely do it. 

-How long must one wait after taking a 1mg allergy test for the tolerance to reset? I noticed you suggested 24 hours in the above post, just wanted to confirm. 

-Is it okay to eyeball the 1mg test? I don't have a scale that can register weights at that low of a level. 


Thanks for any and all advice guys, it's much appreciated.


EDIT: One more question, will smoking bud on this increase the feelings and visuals? Decrease the feelings and visuals? Or is it one of those things that effects each person's experience differently? I'm a regular smoker, so smoking a few bowls won't be anything out of the ordinary, I'm just wondering how it will effect the substance. Thanks again!

As this is a "harm reduction" website, the allergy test is necessary ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


As much as I am impatient, I always allergy test everything new I get, even if it's something I allready have and the two compounds look identical. People selling these drugs make mistakes, and death's have occurred because the wrong compound was sent out before. You are purchasing at the street level, where people commonly pass off one substance as another,  so it's always advisable to test all new product. 


Personally, I give an allergy test 2-3 hours. If at that point I don't "feel anything" I will call it safe enough, (although there is really no such thing).


Eyeballing the 1mg out of a 25mg capsule should be okay IMO, just go small.


If you smoke marijuana, I would have some handy. It could go a long way to making that 25mg 2c-c turn into something beautiful ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). It is a small dose though, and if you have a natural tolerance you might not feel much. On the other hand you could be rather taken aback too.


Enjoy!

>         I've recently attempted to snort 23mg of 2C-C mostly to see if I could trip intensely for a very short duration. However, my nose produced an unusual amount of mucous after insufflation, which instantly converted most of the 2C-C into a nasal drip that I spat out in order to avoid oral absorption. Strange, because this does not usually happen when I snort 2C-I, 2C-E or 2C-P. I ended up tripping only very slightly. Has anybody else had similar problems snorting 2C-C? Is there any possible solution to this problem?

All I can say is that you are incredibly lucky that you had a lot of nose boogers that day.... I posted years ago on this site my horror story after my and a friend decided to spit a ~50mg dose in to and snort ~25mg each thinking it'd be twice as strong making it around the same as a super mellow 50mg oral 2C-C trip. Instead it came on in seconds and despite the horrendous burn the intensity of the trip was up there with the most intense trips I've have in my life I can only estimate it times it by 20x or something huge compared to orally. The whole carpet was alive and crarwlind. Everything was moving, Sensory overload with all the hallucinations. Michael Jordan poster slammed dunked on constant repeat. My friend became so overwhelmed he began throwing up non stop for about 15-20mins or so. We felt absolutely anxious wreaks and I began talking over if we should call an ambulance as the trip/hallucinantion was one of the strongest we'd both ever experienced. There was this force I cannot describe when I went to the backroom. It was like the brightest light shining through every part of my body and really burning uncomfortable. There were some elements that reminded me of the most traumatic trip I've every had on a very potent salvia extract. Yes our setting was far from ideal. My fiends parents were home asleep (lucky we didn't wake them) but honestly 2C-C is insanely stronger snorted than oral. IF ARE CRAZY ENOUGH TO SNORT 2C-C ANYWAY USE EXTREME CAUTION AND START VERY LOW LIkE 3mg AND WORK YOUR WAY UP, OR DON'T SNORT AT ALL! Really 2C-C orally is one of my favourite 2Cs for a light, fun eye candy trip. It's short lived and easy to fit into your day rather that these 12hr+ trips, It's way more colourful than 2C-B or 2C-D and can be relaxing on the comeup unlike most any other 2C-x compund I've tried. PS I also like the unique 3D pop out eyemagic visuals I've had on it.

I would have to say my experiences are not the same that this. 2C-C in summary is psychedelic eye candy! Is the most mild on the head (least intence) of all the 2C-Xs I've tried. I would dose an average size male with 50mg no less. Then it is quite visual. If not another 50mg can be taken. Females, and those affected especially strongly by drugs could start with 25mg. 2C-B, 2C-C & 2C-D all last about the same time somewhere around 6hrs (from memory). 2C-C is much more visual than 2C-B or 2C-D. It's good for new people to psychedelics as it's not a very intense trip. I get 3D pop out visuals (like those eye magic books) when looking at tiles on the wall or posters ect.


Strange. I think I'm similar to many people on this site that rate 2C-B was the most over rated 2C-x at least taken orally at 20-30mg orally (I don't take up the nose as the burn is not worth is!). I rate it down the bottom my my list of 2C-x I've tried. Next to no visuals just some visual distortions and movements, no patterns or hallucinations and seems to get less each time taken. It makes me tired and heavy wanting to go to bead. I feel fairly spaced out and don't seem to come away from the trip having learned anything or gotten much positive out of it. 2C-B was just one of Shulgin's favourites hence the popularity. I don't find it anything like MDMA but rather it is was very similar in the trippy feeling of the other 2C-Xs.

Ended up taking 24mg orally the other day, about six hours after a 1mg allergy test. I have to say, it seemed to be the perfect starting dose. 


Immediately after taking it I felt anxious and almost panicky (I often get this way when trying a drug for the first time, naturally high anxiety,) but as soon as I began to feel the effects all of my anxiety and negative thoughts were gone. I biked to meet up with some friends and we walked around for a while enjoying one of the best sunsets I've seen in quite some time. The weather turned stormy, so we all went to a nearby friend's house and smoked on the back deck. This only made me feel better, as the marijuana seemed to mesh really well with the 2c-c. Afterwards, a couple people headed inside so my best friend and I sat out for a few more hours talking, smoking more and watching what turned out to be a massive lightning storm.


Overall, it was a fantastic time and the dose was exactly what I had in mind; enough to get familiar with 2c-c, but nothing overwhelming. I was able to be just a social as usual, which I really enjoyed. It's left me extremely excited to try a 50mg dose, which I'll probably do sometime in the next month or so. What is the tolerance "reset" time like with 2c-c?

snorting seems a bit tricky. i tried it with 2 10 mg piles and the second one kicked me to an ancious but interesting ++. it wasnt too bad but it crept up on me. especially that second line seemed to interfere with the cleanyness of the comeup (maybe because they were multiple comeups through multiple doses, resulting in multiple bodyload). it wasnt very visual but a trip had def etablished, along with some psychedelic insights and i decided to clean up my room. the peak was short tho and soon the effects diminshed. i feel that its a bit of a waste that way and maybe even lacking some qualities, like emotions and visuals. both were minimal. if snorting means shorter duration and lesser activity but stressier comeup, that wouldnt make it really favorable to other routes.


a few days later i was in the mood to try again but didnt really want a 2 hour comeup, so i tried to vape some. i weightet out 20 mg and inhaled it of tinfoil. i was hoping it would behave similar on foil like 2c-d, which evaporates quite well but not so this time. the steam was pretty harsh, had some pool odor and left brown residue. doesnt look too healthy. after a few hits i noticed some strong changes in my vision. everything i looked at started moving and floating around with sparkles (in opposite to a straight tunnel vision while sober), remining me of the comeup of a mushroom trip. i felt wonderful euphoric. the walls were breathing and melting, everything looked a bit comic like and painted. def +++ id say. i started to feel a bit detached from reality. there was too much energy floating through me in a chaotical way. i focussed on breathing, heart rate was normal and very regular, maybe at 50 bpm. no real spasms, just an uneasyness. i sneak into my grandmas stash and take a zopiclone, which eases me alot and makes the rest of the experience very enjoyable. i ended up watching some big bang theory episodes, drinking a few beers, enjoying the cartoony-altered faces,  smoking some pot and coming down maybe after a bit over 2 hours total.


all in all im blown away from 2c-c, especially after having some pretty frustrated experiments with "tofu" the other days, where i never got to any visual threshold. 2c-c it is def a fullblown psychedelic in the right dosage and an amazing, friendly, warm and colorful one. id never anticipated such a colorful, mushroom like headspace from a 2c-chemical. gonna focus on oral doses now tho, hopefully they will be similar visually at 50-60mg or so. i can see now how 2c-c has its place along with the others in the 2c family with its unique action. where 2c-i lacks some depth, where 2c-e is too edgy and 2c-d is too nothing, 2c-c seems wonderfully balanced and retains a bit of that "seriousness" that 2c-d lacks almost completely.


i wouldnt recommend vaping this compound as it (the hcl) really didnt vape too well but i didnt see alot of other posts with that route so, here it is.


no after effects were felt. no headache and other stuff. im glad my body seems to tolerate this wonderful substance well.

I have a 60mg sample of this, I was thinking about taking it orally but now i'm not sure. I could definitely vape it in my base pipe, is there any easy way to convert it from hcl to freebase?

well duration wise it was poor for a trip, being just 2 hours.youre possibly getting more out of it orally. imagine an acid trip that drops off +2. it was interesting to watch what this substance can do tho.i cant wait for the next (oral) experience with it, maybe while going into the cinema or something ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've got a question about 2C-C, for those with experience.


In your opinion, how does 2C-C fare with music? Good enhancement? I know a lot of people are fond of 2C-E + music. For those that have tried both, which would you prefer for musical purposes (ethyl or chloro)?

Tried 2C-C for the first time today, at 30 mg, orally.


Was really gentle, but nice. I wanted to listen to music, but I ended up getting sidetracked and watched a [pretty interesting talk](https://vimeo.com/19428188). Anyway, the effects were no more than a subtle mood lift, and body-high.


I might try it at ~35 or 40 mg next time.


I wish 2C-B were more readily available. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Maybe try another ROA. Snorting is effective, but it's agony. I reckon 30mg plugged would give you more bang for your buck. Oral doses are fine for me up to about 50 or 60, then the body load gets a bit much.

2c-c is the soft 2c-x  But that being said their is plenty of good times on this chem.  Still gives a body load like all the others  just not a strong.  Visuals are their but tame in comparison the 2c-i or 2c-e     Overall a solid fun chem to explore.  Bump it   but beware  like mentioned above  it burns like all hell.

Tried 40 mg of this earlier tonight. No body load was felt. This is not one that's gonna knock you on your ass, but its quite visual in my experience. It felt relaxing, yet intense at the same time. Visuals were pretty insane at this dosage, warping, bending, twisting, color enhancement all off the charts. 


This would be a great substance to use socially, or to appreciate nature or art without being too impaired.

^ Hm. I'm surprised that you describe the visuals as "insane" at 40 mg. I took 42 mg as my last dose (don't ask why I pick weird numbers like 42 :D) and the visuals were quite mild. I feel like I might be on the low end of the sensitivity spectrum when it comes to 2C-C (whereas tryptamines, particularly 4-substituted, are unusually strong for me).

I'm generally fairly hard headed. My wife took 30 mg and didn't really experience visuals.


I have a light grey blanket hanging on my wall that I use as a background for YouTube vids. Patterns were jumping out at me, there was quite a bit of expanding/contracting going on. At times it looked like it was literally melting off the wall. I've read that some people don't find 2c-c to be very visual, but that appears not to be the case with me.


The only downside to the trip was the short duration.  I think I'm going to try DOC next to see if there are any similarities.

Ugh. I give up on 2C-C. This shit is just toxic to my mind. I kept hoping it was a coincidence, but every time I trip on 2C-C, the next day is full of excessive stress and confusion. Considering how mild the trip is, it's just not worth the nasty hangover IMHO.

I tried 40mg about a month ago, i was quite disappointed, it gives you a headache, short duration, large dose, expensive, weak visuals and more stimulative and not as relaxing or euphoric as DOC.

You're much better off doing DOC, 2C-C is to DOC is like codeine is to morphine.

I have had 500 mg of this sitting around for a while so I think a buddy and I are going to give 40-50mg a go tonight.  We both have quite a bit of experience with 2c-b, 2c-i, and 2c-e so I am interested to compare it to the others.  I have only dabbed a bit of it once but I was on several other substances so I can't really say what effect was from the 2c-c.

If it doesn't get you where you want to be, be open to upping the dose considerably the next time. There seems to be two kinds of responses to this chem; either people respond pretty strongly to it (getting great effect from doses of 20-50mg) or those who need upwards of 70mg + to get good effect. Personally, I fall into the latter. It takes a lot but when I get the right dose it's a wonderful chem.

We both have quite a bit of experience with 2c-b, 2c-i, and 2c-e so I am interested to compare it to the others.  I have only dabbed a bit of it once but I was on several other substances so I can't really say what effect was from the 2c-c.

40mg last night was a good but short time for both of us.  We were near baseline after about 3 1/2 hours.  The come up was quicker than other 2c compounds I have tried.  I have never been so relaxed and content on a psychedelic before though.  It was very nice and a good way to spend the evening.  I will probably try it around 55mg next time.  I had some interesting visuals at 40mg, similar to low dose LSD.  I would like to see how these play out at a higher dosage.  I wonder if this compound would leave me too sedated in a concert setting though.  I didn't want to do anything but lay around and watch Phish dvds last night.

Very surprised to read people think this substance feels toxic/stimulating and uncomfortable.  Didn't Shulgin call it 'intense relaxation'?  While I never found it sedating, it is probably the only psychedelic that is close to sedating....certainly it has a very 'de-stressing' effect for me.  Even the comeup (which on other 2Cs can be a bit edgy) feels so good.


I know people react differently but this material has proven so consistently enjoyable when I shared with others that I am left scratching my head.  I think the only negative effect I have ever heard from anyone is that they could use another 10mg, it is not too potent.  On the other hand, I love 2C-C because it is so gentle and 30-50mg (orally) was always my preferred dosage.


I wouldn't consider it too 'psychedelic' (as in mind expanding), that is a label I reserve for 2C-D, 2C-E and 2C-T-7....but as a euphoriant or for general amusement it is probably as much a 'go-to' as 2C-B.

at the lower dose (20mg) i noticed that it never got me where i wanted to go. it touched on it but before i could take it all in, it was over. I noticed a euphoria and a happiness with this substance. The visuals were similar to 2c-i but were not as long lasting and a bit less intense. on a higher dose of 2c-I at a festival; i noticed unpleasant results and visuals that were bordering on overwhelming/crazy for example objects like trees were turning into a reptile looking face with its "EYE" looking at me, aka 2c-"I" those were the thoughts i was having.. .. i did not get this with 2c-C .. over all it was a very good experience and i would do it again.

I am honestly mad at myself for not trying 2c-c a year ago when I first got this sample.  Now it is going to be a much bigger pain trying to get more when this sample is gone.

I suspect it is more personality related.  Even marijuana does not give me the giggles but your mileage may vary, as they say.

hehe, marijuana give me giggles somatimes, but a reason is needed (like without drugs, but marijuana intensifies the magnitude). With mushrooms is where I fall on hysterical fits of laughter for no reason at all for hours, is very refreshing for me, but the side effects of mushies in terms of anxiety is too much.

I'm kind of a hardhead with 2c-c as well, at doses below 45mg it was a slightly irritating sensation with mild visual alterations, at 45mg or more (didn't get terribly interesting until ~60mg) its one of my favorite 2c's. Really great visually, and a generally friendly headspace taboot

I tried 2c-c at about 60mg orally and it was great. It was a while ago but I think the first effects I started noticing were color enhancement (no nausea) and when I did I started insufflating some MXE. I insufflated multiple doses of MXE over the course of the night so my first time trying was a combo (I know that is not recommended, but it was great fun). After the color enhancement I didn't really get any more effects for about 40 minutes if I remember correctly but at some point I was warmly greeted by a rush of empathogenic stimulation coming from the center of my chest that was very pleasurable. After I was feeling that for a 25 minutes or so I smoked a good amount of marijuana and jammed out on the drums while a (drunk)friend played guitar, and that was AWESOME! I remember most of the visuals kicking in directly after I sat down on the drums and started playing. Unfortunately it was too late for us to play for very long, so after that we all played hackey sack. I was very intoxicated by the MXE, and I was very surprised at how well I was playing hackey sack. I was in a room with tiled marble floors and my depth perception of the tiles was VERY distorted and all of the marble streaks were flowing with color like a lazy river. I played hackey sack for about 30 minutes (remarkably) then sniffed some more MXE and laid down. The rest of the night was pretty much just me being very dissociated and having to tiptoe around a house where everyone was sleeping, and I noticed the comedown of the 2c-c having a VERY sexual vibe to it, so much that I woke up a girl so that I could possibly snuggle with her. Unfortunately nothing beyond that happened but It was definitely a great experience and I'd definitely say that 2c-c is just under 2c-b on my list of favorite 2cs.

two things i noticed with 2c substances..


i find that i start to laugh and always have a smile on my face with this stuff. I think about how silly everything is, things that are normally serious but not dangerous such as the news commentator or figures of speech we tend to use become a joke. the idea of money for example does not make sense and can cause laughter.


I also noticed that when going for a walk or listening to noises that other humans make, such as a saw or a hammer being used etc, its just too much.. when i say too much i mean its just piercing and freaky as if it was an awkward remark someone makes. its like the sounds are overwhelming..

I tried this one again last night at a higher dose, around 55mg with another buddy.  I found 55mg to be too much for me.  Last time was 40mg and wasn't quite enough.  I didn't think upping the dosage would have such a dramatic effect but it was almost an entirely different trip this time.  The visuals were too intense for a while which is something I have never had a problem with.  I was getting tons of shuttering/strobe type effects that were really distracting.  I also had a lot of muscle tension and body load that I didn't notice at the lower dosage.  The come up was much more intense this time and gave my buddy some anxiety.  He had to keep going outside to get fresh air, which was nice but it was only like 10 degrees Fahrenheit out so we couldn't stay out for too long.  The stars were moving around like crazy and the trees without leaves looked like brain synapses.  There was a light snow that made it look like glitter was falling from the sky.  The visuals were quite beautiful but were just too much sitting inside with nothing to do.   I'm guessing about 45mg would be perfect for me.  I am usually a little more sensitive to phens and more of a hard head with tryptamines so that makes sense.  It lasted a good bit longer this time, just over 5 hours compared to 3 1/2 last time.  I did some n20 about an hour and a half in and it was really intense.  I think it kind of changed the trip from there on out.  It may be why I had the really distracting shutter/stobes and tracers for a lot of the trip, coupled with the higher dosage.

Never snorted it, never will, but taken by IM...2C-C is quite different....much more intense, still relaxing but comeup gives a stomach kink or two.  Duration is cut in half.  Since I mention it, I have also tried 2C-D and 2C-B this way and I hate to say it...but I think IM is best way to go.  Never tried snorting any of these, after trying 2C-T-7 snorted...the pain and rough come-up made me of the opinion that PEAs should always be taken orally.  Many years went by and I stuck with that opinion.


I don't know what possessed me to try 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D via IM, was probably just a needle happy stage I was in that has long passed...but I am glad I did because IM is a perfectly valid way to go, at least with these shorter acting PEAs.

Mgs: What about plugging? I read on various forums that rectal administration is "the way" to go with PEAs. Higher BA than oral, faster onset and reduced GI-issues being the main factors.

But I only tried this once with 15mg 2c-b which was much more pleasant than 20mg oral. But I always react pretty sensitive to bodyloads and stomach problems...


2c-c is yet on my list and hopefully will be tried this spring.

I think 2c-c in normal to low doses is a great introduction to the world of psychedelics. Not many bad sides, basic /psy/ effects still present. Overdoses aren't that dangerous compared do some other stuff. Anyone else agree?

You're right about that coursed, but if some wants to try psys and isn't sure about it a lowish dose of 2c-c is, as far as I'm concerned, a great introduction. Gives the basic effect and has very little sides. And yes, before trying something stronger people should be warned of the possible effects.

Never plugged it.  I've only tried a few things (mostly opiates and amphetamine) up the pooper and every time, I either have intense burning pain, or it makes my colon go into spasms.  I mostly stick with oral route for nearly everything I use, some exceptions are things like ketamine, DMT, DPT, and the PEAs I mentioned in my last post, which I prefer via IMing.  Even coca products, I prefer IMing them vs snorting.

IME snorting it just changes the potency. I didn't find it relaxing & pleasant til I got around 50mg oral, but I got that same sensation to two times I snorted it, at 15 & 20mg respectively. However it feels kinda like snorting shards of glass covered in tobasco sauce. Wouldn't really recommend. Since its not terribly expensive I'd opt for the oral route, but if frugality is your thing plugging may be something to look into.

Though based on how it felt in my nose, I imagine it might be unpleasant via that hole as well, never plugged it myself though.

My poor nose hurts just thinking about snorting PEAs. I've only snorted 2c-p as far as PEAs are concerned, and that was still an under dose. It was like holding a butane lighter up my right nostril.

This is the exact reason I finally decided to obtain some 2C-C, primarily because I'm interested in sampling 4-HO-MET and 2C-P but I haven't had a psychedelic experience in about 5 years, and even then I've only done LSD about 5 times and mushrooms 3 times. 


With my experience being so limited, some trip reports I've read on some of the more serious or long-acting PEA's and tryptamines in which the author declares it an "average" or "lackluster" experience sound like they would be entirely overwhelming for me right now, so 2C-C sounds like a gentle re-introduction to the psychedelic headspace and a great way to "get my toes wet", so to speak. I should have the 2C-C within a week so I'll be sure to report back soon from the perspective of an inexperienced tripper being reintroduced to psychedelia for the first time in a long time.

10 minutes clawing at your face with your eyes shut in agony? yea it hurts a lot but not that bad, I snorted 25mg at once and I wasn't clawing at my face but I was tripping balls in like 5 minutes, every object in my room started kinda wobbling individually and I just had to go outside.

Have any of you noticed substantial potentiation when combining 2c-c with mdma? Had a somewhat disconcerting experience a couple months ago. Nothing physically unsafe, just had a bit of swirly amnesiac delirium. Which would've been fine except for I'd wanted to remember the concert I was at & not lose my ride home & have to call a cab... d'oh... gonna attempt this again, but with a substantially lower dose. Just curious if anyone had experienced similar.

MDMA can greatly potentiate any psychedelic, and it seems especially true for the 2c-x class.  I am sure this goes for other phens but I haven't tried many outside the 2c-x and 2c-t-x class.  It is usually smart to dose half your normal dose of each chemical when combining.

Would this same rule of halving apply similarly to a methylone+2C-C combo do you think, or does the significant power of potentiation lie in MDMA's irreplaceable "magic" and not just any ol' serotonin dump?

Yes I have noticed methylone definitely potentiated 2c-b quite a bit.  I would assume the same for 2c-c.  In the right dosage that could be a really relaxed and euphoric trip for laying around the house one night.  Not something I would want to go dance or go to a concert on I don't think.  I would shoot for maybe 110mg of methylone and 25mg of 2c-c depending on what your normal dosages are.

MDAI and 2C-C sounds like an excellent combination too, with even less stimulation than with Methylone... seems like it could get * r e a l l y * lazy... in a very nice way, of course ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


Anyone out there have any experience with combining these two? Or even MDAI with other 2C's? Seems like most of them should be relatively safe with moderate amounts of each substance, right?

Yeah sounds good. I'm just saying it can get more intense than you expect. Combining MDMA with 2C-B got quite crazy for me, was totally dissociated and just lying there losing track of time.  So be moderate but it should be a blast.

Thanks for the info. Just out of curiosity, is there a dose of 2C-C + methylone that you think you *would* find enjoyable for dancing or going to a concert, or is that just not in the nature of 2C-C? I'm thinking 10-15mg 2C-C and 150mg methylone for an electronic music show where the vast majority of the crowd would be mind-altered ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I'm running low on both chems, so lately I have been toying with 2c-i + 2c-c combinations with a lot of success. Usually around 12-15mg of 2c-i and 30-40 of 2c-c. The 'sedating' feel of 2c-c helps to mellow out what I experience as some restless energy of 2c-i. Makes for a thoughtful, visual, relaxing little trip, strong but very manageable. I am really starting to love 2c-c!

To add to this giant pool of second hand information;


As it was said;


2C-C effects are very similar to 2C-I, but much less potent. Where 20-30MG produces strong psychedelic/empathogenic for many user I can garuntee you that 50-60MG of 2C-C is needed to produce anywhere close to the effects of 20 - 30 MG of 2c-I, and honestly I would say an oral dose higher then that would be needed to have intensity on par to 2c-I.


How does it relate to 2c-I effect wise? Well if you have experianced 2c-I before you know how the visuals are optical in a way, but most of all foggy and stoney. 2c-C visuals are very foggy and 2c-I like in that since, but not as optical as 2c-I. 

2C-C is also a pretty empathogenic out of the 2C-X series, on the scale for empathogenic effects of the 2c-x I'd put it like this (2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-C, 2C-E, 2C-P)

Although it holds a lot of potential, don't over shoot and expect to much out of this, it's not always about intensity. She can definitaly be a gem for the right people

I wager that they will "fight" each other, in view that the nature of the compounds is so different. I've orally combined 2C-T-7 at 12mg and 4-AcO-DMT at 18mg (an hour and a half after T-7) and the two materials battled for supremacy the entire time. It wasn't necessarily a bad mixture, but I would describe it as ill-defined -- neither here or there. The only really positive thing about that combo was that the phenethylamine helped to overcome the rather drowsy and decidedly asexual (for me) qualities of 4-AcO-DMT.


Anyway, if someone can provide information regarding my question on post #134, please chime in.

I assume that your wish is to consume that amount via oral ROA... Ingesting such a dose should depend on the quality of the material you obtain (along with the current set and setting). If the material is of medium-high quality, 100mg should be OK for some people, albeit still quite strong. With a high quality synthesis, 100mg is very strong indeed, and frankly, not that great because of the increased side effects, including significant nystagmus. I tried such a dose with a fine synthesis approximately a year ago, and although it wasn't bad, it was not as good as a 60mg experience with the same batch. Currently, I possess an ultra-high quality synthesis of this drug and I would not even consider dosing 100mg. Even 50mg was borderline excessive, so I've settled with 40-45mg.

I'm considering investing in some 2C-C, but am not sure if I can afford it due to the high amount of material needed to get a substantial trip. I'm extremely experienced with T2 and 2C-I to a lesser extent, with a very hard head for psychs. I would generally insufflate 30-40mg of 2C-T-2, what would an equipotent dose be? 


Also could someone give me a quick rundown on the subtleties of this one besides it is apperantely relaxing?

For me 2c-c is a really gentle drug. Practically no body load, light on the mind fuck aspect of /psy/s, quick come up, relatively short duration, low chance of a bad trip happening. However the visuals are kinda boring compared to some other /psy/s and as you have said it's price/effect ration isn't really the best.


If you're looking for something visual with low body load, only minor mindfuck, short duration, low chance of a bad trip... aka a more recreational /psy/ I'd recommend looking at 4-ho-met. All the positives of 2c-c + the visuals are more fun and it's more cost effective (most doses being between 10 and 20mg).

When I read about 2C-C that sounds a little like 2C-D to me where are the differences?

And if I allready have 25c does it make sense at all to try 2C-C?

At common doses, 2C-D has a much more ambiguous signature than 2C-C. 2C-C is essentially recreational, while 2C-D is more akin to a nootropic (at common doses). At very high doses, 2C-D can become much more intense than 2C-C at comparable doses, particularly on the mind.


2C-C is very different from 25C-NBOMe, so yes, it does make sense to try 2C-C if you have already tried 25C-NBOMe. The NBOMe compounds are not simply more potent versions of their parents. They are different drugs in their own right.

So its even softer than 2C-D, I thought thats hardly possbile maybe that is because I dosed between 30-50mg and only once did I feel nervous.

No... 2C-D is "softer" at common doses but "harder" at high doses, at least for me. Generally speaking, 2C-C lies somewhere in the middle.

Not recommended.

I took over 200 mg once, by accident actually.

Anyways, it was intense visually, and had a DXM flavor to it. Very wispy visuals, light, airy, but intense. 


Never seemed too worried after I realized what happened. Just rode it out. 


Again, not recommended, an anecdotal but honest report.

So I've got a gram coming my way, but i don't have anything besides 4-AcO-DMT and 5-MeO-DMT to combo with it, once I give it the initial try. Maybe insufflate some 5-MeO-DMT on the comedown? I like to try everything in a combo at least once.

Maybe my experience was idiosyncratic but this drug seemed to be one of the most benign drugs I've put in my body. potentially good for low dose antidepressant/receptor sensitizing/ up regulation regimen? 


All I know is that if I had an unlimited supply of this I would end up exploring every quality it has to offer

I wouldn't take it every day, but it is one of the gentlest 2cs around. A great introductory /psy/, probably tied with 4-ho-met (would be the best (crazy visuals) if it was more stable in solution and easier to measure in lowish doses).

Ok, after orally ingesting 80mg of 2C-C (I have been described as a "hardhead" however), I had absolutely no side effects I would describe as "awful" or "bad". It came on very quick,maybe at the ++ stage in less than an hour. I had eaten a lot, about 3 or 4 hours before, so there was a stomach heaviness that made me think I was gonna have to sit on the toilet for some time, but that passed in about 15-20 minutes. I did feel a jittery body load that quickly relaxed (I seem to get them a lot, though), and at about an hour to an hour and a half in, I was at a very nice +++. Great visuals, open and closed eyed (alhough the close-eyed visuals couldn't compare to 2C-B in my opinion, they were still wonderful and worth experiencing). It IS a VERY relaxing phenethlymine, and the only questionable part of my experience with it, was about 6-7 hours after ingesting it, I decided to lie down while listening to a Dead acoustic set, and I don't believe I fell asleep, but there was definitely a "black-out" period for lack of a better term. I remember it being 3:00AM, laying down, listening to the Dead, and the next thing I remember is it being around 6:00AM and the sun was coming up. I could've fallen asleep, or I could've been in a state of such great concentration that my mind wandered elsewhere on its own. Either way, I have no recollection of anything that happened in that 3 hours, call it a black out if you will. This was my first experience with 2C-C, and I hold it in high regards, it was rather enjoyable.

^ i experienced something similar a few times on low/moderate doses of 2C-E. dosed in the evening, then after the comeup, lied down in my bed, lights off, with trippy but relaxing music. mind goes blank for 1-2 hours and when i "wake up", it really doesn't feel like i've actually fallen asleep. i didn't find it uncomfortable nor did it worry me though.

Thank you very much for sharing. I wasn't really worried or uncomfortable either, just kind of confused as to what had just happened. Glad to know I'm not the only one. In other news, I believe 2C-E is next, and I am really looking forward to that journey.

yeah 2C-E is pretty awesome, but in my opinion you have to be careful with set and setting. the best trips i had outside with friends. the bodyload is also much easier to handle if you have enough space to move and fresh air.

So my feelings on 2C-E (and it played out this way in all 4 of my experiences) is that the most productive time to have with it is to have a daytime trip.  2 of my trips were at night, 2 in the day...the 2 day ones were ecstatic and (in one case) a ++++ and my two night trips were disturbing to say the least.


Do you Bagseed (or anyone) also feel day is best for 2C-E?

yeah most of my 2C-E trips were in the evening and either nasal or rectal administration, and rather lowdose for recreation, but the two trips that really shined were in the daytime with good friends, one in a house with garden and the other sitting on the top of a hill with a view over the whole city i live in. awesome times, and the trip in this house was the most therapeutic one i've ever had.


tripping alone can be fun but is far from ideal, at least i view it like that now.

Took 65mg last night while a friend was on MDMA.


I started with 34mg, but I think it was about 3.5 hours later and with still no sign of visuals or whatsoever, I decided to add some 31mg of 2C-C. Actually I was thinking the stuff wouldn't hit me, but one hour later an extreme body load started through all of my body. I felt shivering cold, like I had the flu but different, uhhgg.

I think it was a half hour later when the rooms in my house started to change. It was something like all that I didn't focus on, was waving like a flag in a stormy wind. These visuals were so intens, I felt sea sick and it gave me the feeling if I needed to throw op. Luckily I got myself together and started to enjoy the 2C-C. It's very hard for me to remember all what happened then, but the one thing I know, I have been making jokes all night long and they were flowing out my mought, and they got better and better, if I was a comedian. I can't hardly remember it all to actually to write it down. I stil know that the end of the trip the same body load was coming back as the one when it all started, I decided then I would never take this compound, but only in low doses in combination with others like it did before.


I was being able to control myself and had absolutely no signs of going insane, it was a fun night, but this dose was definitely way to much, becaus of the body load.

Funny...my notes suggest I did take 20mg 2C-C on top of some MDMA.  MY notes say do not repeat.  I have no memory but I can tell you I remember all of my 2C-B/MDMA trips, 2C-T-7/MDMA trips, and the one time I took 2C-I with MDMA.


2C-C has some unique action, though I still say it is the most mescaline like of the bunch.


PS really BlueDolphin gets the credit in my eyes for discovering the real magic of 2C-C in my book.  At the 20-40mg range, the magic isn't really there and I doubt I would have ever ventured higher if not for his writings.  I still have not gone above 60mg 2C-C, don't think I ever will.  Being around a very close brother who took 80mg last week (which I was on 60mg) was high enough!  Gets very visionary (i don't mean visual) at that range.

I've tried 2C-E, 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-I, and 2C-T-2.  I'd just like to say that 2C-C visuals can be freaking awesome! I ate 30 mg, then just before it kicked in around the 2 hour mark, I snorted 5 mg.  Come-up was not very enjoyable and I thought I wasn't going to enjoy the drug, but once the visuals kicked in I was amazed.  Unfortunately the amazing visuals didn't last too long, and the high itself felt like something was lacking in the overall quality of the experience.  2C-C also lacked the energy that 2C-I has and the experience was very short lived.  Nothing really special when combined with MDMA in my opinion.  Due to the unique visuals, I plan to try 2C-C again at higher dosages, like maybe 40 mg, plus another 5 snorted, or maybe 50-55 down the hatch.

Trying this for the first time in a few days. Besides 3c-p (35mg , light dose , light pyschedelic in general , very mild) 2 days prior no tolerance in 10 days. plan is insuff 20mg


Besides the burn which im confident won't bother me , i don't say that as a tough guy but because my preferred roa with 4-fa is nasal , which i don't suggest in the least , becomes way more-ish and literally forcefully makes tears drop from my eye the first bump or two and can leave the nasal insides feeling and looking like hell (blood , scab , just all around worst thing that i've ever put up my sniffer but for same odd reason still do so)


not much 2cx experience. 2c-i 10mg nasal which was pretty mild tho i think another 4-5mg would provide fairly intense experience via that ROA.


only have a 50mg sample of 2cc tho saving 30mg for oral sometime in future , thinking go for like 3 piles out of the  remaining 20mg , 2 at first , wait 15min and evealuate , so roughly 13-15mg initial with 5-7 booster...


just any advice on nasal would be appreciated. dose , stagger a booster dose at what point if im not satisfied? 


I'm not looking for full blown psychedelic experience , subtle , something i can look sober on.  i may or may not inform a few of the people im with im in a altered state , i know on 3cp at the dose i can fully hide the fact whilst still enjoying myself (which would be painstaking with most tryptamines at a respectable dose and pea's to a lesser extent) , but if found out it's not an issue , I'm an adult , there adults , i just know they don't use drugs and if i don't have to explain my use i'd rather not , 


at the same time im not looking to under-dose

Tried this the first time today orally at 30mg.


My plans had changed and I was a bit dissapointed but didn't want to waste the day so decided to trip anyway. During the comeup phase I had a small bump of 4-MeO-PCP. Took about an hour before it gently started coming on. I was in a park at the time and usually get the urge to clear my bladder etc during the comeup so went home for a bit. At this point I cried a little. I've got quite a bit under the surface right now and as I've been using dissociatives primarily for the last few years which helps numb certain things and process them from a detached perspective but I know the value of classic psychedelics for shadow work and going deeper into these feelings so it was something I looked forward to, though not the catharsis I need.


After that short phase I went to a different park, and listened to music (my own) under the trees. It was wonderful to see all the leaves dancing along to the music and was very therapeutic for me. This was also the most visual stage which was still very gentle. As the sensory effects began to wane I had a few more bumps of 4-MeO-PCP which didn't seem to synergize, but rather compete with and overwhelm the gentle effects of 2C-C. 4 hours after the dose I was mostly back to baseline but still enjoying the last bit of sunshine in the park.


Overall it was an enjoyable and therapeutic experience but not very deep. I think next time I'll try 50mg and see if that has more to offer. Part of the reason I've been drawn to dissociatives the last while is that they can take you pretty far out but in a gentle/relaxing way and I feel 2C-C could be useful in helping me delve back in to traditional psychedelics with the ease I've come to take for granted with MXE (etc).

I'd definitely agree with that.  I had pushed 2C-C on a friend who wants a decisively gentler return to psychedelia.

Hi folks,


I wanna share my impressions with this chem briefly.


Insufflated 15 mg :


- pre-condition : hungover, pissed mind state

- during experience :

	- rough comeup

	- mild visuals, only tracers, morphing when concentrating on blurry objects

	- positive mood

	- between + and ++

	- duration ~2 hours

- post-condition : stimulated, good mood


Insufflated 30 mg :


- pre-condition : tired, awful mood, lost mind

- during experience :

	- rough comeup (similar to 2c-e) : neausea, ugly drip in nose and throat for 30 min.

	- peak is reached after 45 min., awesome visuals : fractal-like geometric tracers, nice, smooth bodyload

	- +++ for about 15 minutes (peak), then lingering to ++

	- lesson from the trip : "god is the moment, obey the moment"

	- very positive mood (perhaps too positive) without any mental obstacles

	- trip can be switched on and off willingly, feels rather recreational

	- duration of main effects ~90 minutes (after that just + for a few hours)

- post-condition : pretty tired


Summary :


If I had to personify 2c-c I would imagine it as a lazy, intelligent, hedonistic teenage girl. It feels certainly feminine to me, lets you focus on the positive

aspects but does not force you in any direction, opposed to 2c-e, DPT, 4-Aco-DMT. It feels similar to 4-HO-MET, though a bit less giggly perhaps. 

It is one of the few psychs, that you can take, when you feel like shit and when you've got

no time without hesitating about the outcome. I guess that insufflation is the way to go, as 30mg are probably comparable to 45-50mg orally and the effects start instantly. Up to now, it is the least

serious psychedelic I have tried (pushed 4-HO-MET on the 2nd place). Can anybody compare 2c-c to 25c-Nbome shortly ? Are those comparable at all ?

Can any comment on the efficiency of oral boosters? Say I start with 30 mgs, and 2 hours in decide to drop another 10 hourly? I know with some phens this does not increase potency only length.


Also, I am looking for a recreational experience, warmth, color enhancement and maybe slight visuals and music enhancement ... nothing too crazy. Sounds like I should shot for around 35 milligrams? Obviously everyone responds differently.


Should also note that I will be consuming some beers (too experience with them sadly) and will have etiz in case of emergency.

oral boosters after the first hour dont seem to work for me, perhaaps if.the dose is large enough they prolong the trip... maybe. id say go for the total dose at once and enjoy it for what it is. orally its still a good 4h trip for most people... 


doae wise id say anything between 30 to 40 mg to start with if you arent especially sensitive. 


etiz wont probably be needed, and too many beers might decrease the psychedelia

Hello,


Mr Phactor, your chances of survival are outstanding in the way you plan to operate. Better safe then sorry. I do hope you have enough beer ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). Personally, I recommend another dosis, but i am an idiot. It is just a coindince that I am tripping on the substance at the moment for the first time. I like the E, D, I, B ways better. Festivals B and D (for me E) are oke, but C will work for you hopefully and if it is a good party, well enjoy. I am sorry for spellingerrors and it is my opinion ofcourse, but at least it is a reply.


Edit: post of mr zirrp is pretty brilliant, if you ask me. I cannot compare the 25Cnbome (never been a testsubject to that one) with 2cc, but for what it's worth. 2c-I is in no way comparable with 25I-NBO. Opinion btw


Bye

I do hope you have enough beer ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). Personally, I recommend another dosis, but i am an idiot. It is just a coindince that I am tripping on the substance at the moment for the first time. I like the E, D, I, B ways better. Festivals B and D (for me E) are oke, but C will work for you hopefully and if it is a good party, well enjoy. I am sorry for spellingerrors and it is my opinion ofcourse, but at least it is a reply.

I absolutely love B and I isn't too bad... I have B at my disposal but I prefer to save that for concerts or the like. Who knows I might decide to share that with my friend. I have t7 as well. E is fun, but a bit too deep for my liking.


Anyways I might have too small doses of 4-aco-met at the ready to throw in the mix if I need it. 


Also, not having enough beer is never an issue.


Two questions, how would this mix with a small dose of 2c-b? Say 10 milligrams or so?


I guess my other question is how do people find the euphoria on this one? My 2c-c doses have been pretty small.

Well, in case you mean combining 2cc with 2cb: I only have only experience with the combinations 2ce/2ci, 2ce/2cd, 2cb/2ce, 2ce/2cc. And I enjoyed all these combinations. But yesterday I boosted my 2cc trip with 20 mg of 4-HO-MET. And that was nice. And a possitive side issue was that I mixed the 2cc with the 4-HO-MET, which was pleasant for the nose. (2cc is the only Phen I snort btw and 4-HO-Met the only Triptamine, usually I only snort air). 


Cheers

i've tried it in dosages ranging from 25 to 65 mg and i actually like it. in low dosages (< 35mg) is too much on the background but higher dosages (> 55) definitely give a nice trip combined with some weed


* i wrote this on 65 mg 2c-c + joint and i enjoy it a lot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

30mgs gel-cap on empty

1.5 hours in, sense of come-up, lots of yawning

2 - most intense – a few sparks, tracers on moving things, psychedelic sheen/shifting – a higher dose would make an intense trip

3 hours in – pupils still very dilated, psychedelic sheen, pleasant languid effect, want to stretch out. Intensity gone but this is good. Chemical could be a very brief psychedelic experience for a few hours in an evening. No intrusive thoughts or feelings, but certainly could happen. Not a stimulant. Body-load manageable – slight shakes, no gut discomfort of any kind.


50mgs gel-cap on empty

start at 8pm

45 min, feeling come-up

1.5 hour – intense loud music makes intense thoughts

the rest as same as above, but more breathing of walls and less “sheen” & tracers. Hint of “psychedelic depression”. Not as intense as expected. Perhaps I need to leave a wider gap between trips.

I insufflated 85mg and vaporized 15mg of high purity 2C-C about 2 months ago and it may have been my favorite pure phenethylamine trip I've ever had. The visuals where bright green and gold with amazing fractals that went into infinity. The head space was so calm I felt like I could have taken twice as much and been fine. In fact the visuals and body high was so strong that I literally couldn't tell what was 'real' and what was coming from the drug itself. It's a gem among gems, top 5 psychedelics ever! I had a beautiful experience and felt so serene, I am so thankful to have taken that journey, it'll always be one of my best trips without a doubt.


The body load was literally non existent and the euphoria was unrivaled. I don't know guys, the visuals were so complex that I literally need help articulating what I experienced. And this trip was taken during a very dark time of my life, so set and setting don't seem to be as vital to using this chem as many others. I think the next time I explore this compound I'll plug 70mg and consume another 35mgs nasally as a booster when I'm starting to peak.


This chem is absolutely beautiful! Although I live in the US, there is no way in hell anything will stop me from restocking. It's just too damn good to not have it around. My best analogy would be like taking a massive dose of 2C-B with diminished stimulation combined with the mental clarity sharpness of 2C-I, minus the body load.

Good description of it. Glad to know others feel the same way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's the first psych I ever tried a few years ago and still my favorite. So versatile.

I miss the days when it was easy to get here.

Okay so I had my first trip with this today and I was SOOO let down to say the least. I purchased half a gram about 2 months ago and thought I lost it at a party, well it turns out I never took it with me because I got a nice surprise when cleaning out my freezer. I dosed 30 mgs on a mostly if not empty stomach. Tbh I can't even give a proper timeline because it was soo damn subtle I couldn't discern a proper come-up. I felt something was gonna happen but it never really came, even with top-shelf medical buds. I just felt very weird and actually wanted to come down as it felt like I was stuck in an uncomfortable come-up sans the anxiety and jitters. I could see how people call it relaxing but at this dose it was... well weird lol. The visuals were extremely weak but there, I mean weaker than my lsa trips which all sucked, especially compared to the gut-wrenching sickness they gave me. At the least a decent headspace would've been nice but I was not expecting to get it from this chem. This was purchased from a VERY reliable vendor who works through invite only and whom I've purchased many goodies from before. The purity was 98%


Since this was definately a threshold dose I doubt it caused too much tolerance so I'm going to go for a 50mg dose and see where that takes me. If nothing happens I'll give a week or two break and go for 60.... if nothing still happens then plugging and combination experiments will ensue. Very strange drug, nothing like 2c-i or some of the other 2c's. I should mention I haven't tripped in 2 weeks and the last psych I took was aMT which tbh builds little if any tolerance in one use with me.

this is my favorite 2c-*

so beutifull indeed psychedelic candy 

4 people divided 50mg nasaly with 100-200mg mxe per person and maybe a mg or two of etizolam, weed, ur-144, nitrous oxide.

it was mindblowing to say the least. 

2c-c is amazing

Anyone mixed with 4-FA? 


I had 200mgs gelcap of 4-FA and then 20mgs of 2C-C after 4 hours - but didn't even feel the 2C-C on an empty stomach.

2C-C doesn't even have noticeable effects at 20mg, I can't really see 4-FA potentiating 2C-C to the point where it doubles the effectiveness of the chemical. Most people consider 30mg threshold, 50mg the sweetspot, and 60mg is usually where the ceiling kicks in.

I'd have to agree, 30mgs was most definately a threshold dose. I can imagine 20mgs doing nothing beyond placebo or *very slight* tingling. Go for 40mgs next time. I don't see why you would want to combine the two in the first place but hey, different strokes for different folks.

Has there been any further info. on sublingual doses, as per discussion here?:


[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/...lly)-3rd-time-Soft-and-Pleasant-Introspection](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/131195-2C-C-(20mg-sublingually)-3rd-time-Soft-and-Pleasant-Introspection)


Recently ingested 40mgs then snorted maybe 10mgs 2 hours later after taking 60mgs MPA 6 hours previously. Mostly felt mellow with very mild patterns on light, flat surfaces. Nothing intense.

Sublingual? Ouch, 2c-x's tend to be pretty caustic. I'd imagine it would probably leave chemical burns, even if it doesn't do you really think you'd be able to keep a solid dose in your mouth for 20-30 mins? That shit tastes horrible. Maybe you should just plug it?

CaptainKratom may be inexperienced with 2c's but he is right.  BTW, it would absorb in faster than 20 or 30 mins.  However, with some 2C-E, putting it under your tongue is one of the worst pains of your life.  Feels like your tongue literally becomes chopped off (like it literally feels like its bleeding) in a few seconds and the pain becomes unbearable.  No ACTUAL chemical burns however, just really bad pain.  It also hurts like fuck to insufflate.

umm I'm not totally inexperienced with 2c's. I've done I, D, E, and C if you count that threshold dose ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png). Also there ARE chems that leave white bumps and tenderness, there should be no arguement there. When I say 'burn' I don't mean that litterally. Its not like a 2c is gonna burn a hole under your toungue but it may leave a tender wound behind which I reffer to as a 'burn'. Maybe you should do some reading...

Sorry to call you inexperienced, I think I read the wrong post thinking it was you ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

But about the burn, I'm just relating my own experience.  In my experience the pain made it unbearable before there was any actual physical damage.

Np man, what I was trying to say is if you keep an active dose under your tongue for 30 mins then there's gonna be some tenderness. I mean this chem burns the nose and rectum, It's bound to leave some kinda marks in your mouth, not to mention the disgusting taste, this doesn't seem like a good ROA. Also the people who tried it 

said it was barely more potent  than oral. Just doesn't seem worth it.


So I combined aMT (40mgs plugged), 4-aco-dmt (15mgs oral), and 2c-c (20mgs plugged) and had a fucking blast. This chem really showed it's colors. Visuals were insane, euphoria was un-rivaled, and the headspace was totally benevolent and positive. 2c-c is a great building block for amazing combos. It's just so damn smooth, I love it. I think plugging is the only ROA that I will continue to use with this chem. Smoother, quick come-up, and WAY more potent than oral.

sure did :D, it was the best combo I've done to date. One thing that kinda freaked me out was that I either blacked out or passed out during the end of the experience. Once things were near baseline I took a dose of kratom and 1.5 mgs etizolam and while watching TV I blacked out. I was watching TV at 3:00 AM and next thing I know it's eight in the morning. I don't recall waking up, I think I was fully conscious the whole time as the TV channel was on a different station then before this 'blackout'. I think the etiz was strongly potentiated. Also I must say you are an animal when it comes to psychedelics, I mean GD I couldn't imagine taking all those chems in that report. I am surprised you got a ++++ with 40 mgs 2c-i though. I found 30mgs oral with 5mgs snorted a bit underwhelming. A ++/+++ experience, I am a hardhead when it comes to 2c's though. Even though tripping two days in a row isn't advised I decided to plug 30mgs 2c-c about 20 mins ago and am debating whether or not to plug 10mgs of psilacetin for a more defined headspace. I've also got DOC, 25D nbome, 4-ho-met, and 5-apb on the way so more combo experiments will ensue.


Edit: decided to plug the 4-aco-dmt, I think I'm in for a treat :D

That was a fluke with 2C-I. I absolutely hated that chemical. So much stimulation, so little visual... That was actually the only time that 2C-I was pleasant to me was in the high dose and the friend who was with me had the same thing to say regarding high dose 2C-I versus lower dose attempts. I'd never take 2C-I again but I wanted it gone so I finished the rest of it and tossed the vial lol. The rest of that...... yeaaaaaaa I was a stupid kid back then. What was that, 2004? I was like 19 when I did that. I was young, dumb, and full of cum as they say ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Besides, you don't even have to be at a +++ to hit a ++++. I've had a ++++ while I was at a ++.5 or so. If your mind gets in that state where its been opened, you're going to have quite the experience either way. That said, in case you couldn't tell, I was at a very strong +++ LMAO


I have a bitch of a tolerance when it comes to phens too... Look at the report haha! The only phens I've found that I don't have a high tolerance for are methylenedioxy ring amphetamines. I even have a high tolerance to mescaline which is horrible ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


You've got me on the psilacetin. That stuff consistently produced anxiety in me every single time that I took it. I gave up around the 10th time. It didn't even mix with 2C-D which I found mixed positively with everything.


You've got some of the things I'd love to try. 25D, DOC and I would love taking 2C-C and 4-HO-MET again. Make some trip reports man ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


EDIT: 2C-C and 4-HO-MET probably would make a killer combo by the way.

I will more likely than not make trip reports of my experiments, at least the worthwhile ones. I too wasn't too fond of 2c-i, it was stimulating with no depth. It also left me with some visual disturbances for weeks after. I find psilacetin to cause nasty anxiety on the come-up but it's immediately dropped off into a sedating trip with little mindfuck unless the doses are high, at least far less than mushies. Funny you mention the 2c-c and metocin combo as that was what I planned on taking first, should bs relaxing eye candy. Can't wait till my package comes.

That's exactly how I found 2C-I as well. It was nasty. The high dose just hit some sort of a sweet spot though. I didn't even notice a lot of crazy stimulation that time. Kind of paradoxical but my buddy took 50mg and had the same general experience.


Psilacetin even managed to ruin a blissful AMT experience for me - after that, I said hell no.


If mixing 2C-C with 4-HO-DiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT is any indicator, you're in for quite a wild ride with 4-HO-MET because I found 4-HO-MET to be the most visual of all of the hydroxylated tryptamines I've tried. 


Whatever you do with 2C-C though, don't mix it with a club night or something similar like I did. That was a disaster and killed the night very early. All of a sudden both of us got really hot and then sick and ended up leaving. We didn't feel better until we were out of the club. We were both so sure that it would be a great club drug but nope.

Hmm I find psilacetin at low/medium doses lovely with aMT. Adds alot of euphoria, color, and morphing. Sort of fills in the visuals that aMT struggles to fullfill. 2c-c just doesn't seem like a club drug so needless to say that won't be happening.

It added a lot of visuals but added an extra Klonopin to the mix.


Ironically, some DPT about a half hour later blasted the anxiety away completely and my buddy and I were on a completely different level and blew our trip sitter's mind haha.


2C-C seemed like the most likely candidate for a relaxing club night. This wasn't supposed to be a high energy dance party because it was psytrance that was playing. I think what really killed it is that it was at a gay club and my friend was a huge homophobe. I noticed that 2C-C increases empathy quite a bit and I already have a tendency to pick up on people's moods and it affects me when I'm sober. The fact we both felt better after leaving the club probably says a lot about that because we salvaged the trip pretty much right after although I was agitated that I ended up driving under the influence again. He made it up to me though. We went and smoked some DMT that he had extracted. Beautiful crystals. Just took some puffs to get visual input without hitting hyperspace. 2C-C's mindset was perfect for launching into a low dose DMT experience, the visuals lasted a good 45 minutes and it felt amazing.


So what are your thoughts about 2C-C versus 2C-D? I found 2C-D to be the most useful of all the phenethylamines. 2C-C was second in line. They both seemed to make great combos but 2C-C made some things feel edgy which 2C-D never did even when I mixed it with MDA.

Ahh so the tension was likely the culprit. IMO 2c-c makes a great 'chill at home' drug, 2c-i seems like a better club drug. In fact that's where I first tried it and the only time I found it pretty fun. I had an outlet for all the extra energy. I only took 2c-D twice (both by itself) and had a good time. It felt more meaningfull and deeper than 2c-c and 2c-i, though not quite as deep as 2c-e. This made the first trip a bit uncomfortable as I was at a drumnbass party around some drunk knuckleheads. My second trip was very nice, another smooth chem but I seemed to need quite a bit (65 mgs) for a low-ish +++. Don't get me wrong, it was very much enjoyable but I feel I need more experimentation at higher doses to give it a fair rating. The headspace did get pretty deep and meaningfull, I'd have to agree this was one of the most usefull 2c's outta the ones I've tried for that purpose. Have you combined D with C? 


 I find aMT to abolish any anxiety that other chems may bring, but then again I like to keep aMT the star of the show therefore never add more than 15mgs of 4-ACO-DMT. Do mushrooms cause the same type of anxiety for you? Also what's your typical 4-ACO-DMT dose and how much did you add to that aMT combo? Also aMT and DMT is something I'm planning soon, not enough to break through though.

On the matter of 2C-C vs 2C-D...


2C-C is more colorful and the euphoria is a little more pronounced in my experiences.

2C-D lends itself easier to a really nice body high and smoother comeup. A little more generic feeling.

After the comeup, a 2C-C body high can be really nice too, but you have to focus your attention on experiencing that aspect of it.


Both substances can be incredible enhancers of sex and intimacy. Highly recommended.

Ironically, my 2C-B experiences have paled in comparison in that department, contrary to Shulgin's notes. That may well be because I have yet to try 2C-B at a comparatively effective dose. (Most I did was 27mg - still underwhelmed)


I have never combined 2C-C and 2C-D, but I would definitely like to!

When taken separately, a typical dose for either 2C-C or 2C-D would be around 60-65mg. (oral)

(the response I get per mg seems to be about the same for both)

What would be a good dosage combination? 25mg + 25mg? (I wonder how much more intense this would be than 50mg of either one alone)

Sounds about right, though I don't find 2c-d *that* generic, Although I admittedly don't have too much exerience with it. Only other thing that didn't fall into my experiences was sex on 2c-d, it just didn't feel sexual to me. I was with my girlfriend both times and I just wasn't feeling it. I will say that others have noted the erotic with other chems such as 5-meo-dipt which didn't have that effect on me so I guess I'm just weird. On the otherhand when I plugged that 30 mgs of 2c-c with 10mgs psilacetin the day before yesterday I was an animal lol. Sex just felt so primal and I had complete control over orgasm, It was great :D. That's something I would never be able to do on 4-aco-dmt alone. Also sounds like your doses are around what I would take. IMO if I had 2c-d at hand I'd consume at least 30mgs of each but that's just me and probably not the best HR info so It would probably be best to work your way up.


Ps: DOC and 25D just made it's way to my hands in the form of beautiful blotters ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

last night 30mgs oral (gelcap on empty). Pupils dilated. Open friendly feeling (as opposed to my usual dysphoria). Last several hours. Slight psychedelic "sheen" but no "dance". No negative effects (e.g. no jaw tension, sweating, heart was normal, no head-fuck.). Felt fine the next day. Was taken after being 10 hours in with 40mgs of MPA. Downed a bottle of white wine. 


Tonight - 40mgs oral (gelcap on empty). Waiting for results. Wonder how long and how often one can take a 2C-C meal to feel the briefly be a friendly human with no burdens. Drinking white.

40 mg the day after 30 mg will likely be weaker than the 30 mg.

bloodshed344 was right about this.


Plus, for the last three days I've barely been able to eat, have taken several days off work mostly to sleep and feel utterly depressed... the likely consequence of this 2C-C & MPA binge, plus possibly the toll taken on my stomach from bombing so many chems recently.

I doubt the negative effects were caused in any way by the 2c-c as I felt no negative effects after dosing aMT, 4-aco-dmt, and 2c-c one day followed by 2c-c and 4-aco-dmt the next and the doses of the 2c-alone was around yours. I will say the second trip was way less intense but I can't say the tolerance was caused by the 2c-c alone. Although aMT and psilacetin cause little tolerance after one use for me and other phens tend to increase my tolerance more so than tryptamines I'd say the 2c-c played a hefty role in the tolerance. Btw how was the combo? Did it sort change the experience into a more 2c-i like one or simply like an amphetamine and 2c-c.

Hey guys, I just got my hands on this chem.


What would y'all recommend for a starter dose? Has anyone had any issues taking it after a few nights of drinking? Anyone experience dehydration from it?


Also, this is my first RC I've gotten my hands on. I didn't realize the powder would be so small. Would you recommend scale weighing each dose out of my 250mg bag, or to make some sort of liquid measurement? I have access to a mg scale now. Is it okay to just store it in it's bag in a cabinet, or should I try to seal it in an amber vial when possible?


I'm thinking of trying maybe 30mg orally for starters. I only have 250mg of it at the moment.

Yeah, that should be a good 1st dose. Maybe go down to 20-25mg if you're really sensitive to psychs. There's not too much bodyload, I get a twinge of nausea sometimes with higher doses but otherwise it feels fine. Phens are pretty stable so it'll be ok in the baggie. A milligram scale will be good enough, it might be off by +/- 2mg or so but with 2C-C that's not going to make much of a difference. Also, you can try taking an antacid about 15 minutes before dosing, that will help improve oral absorption.


Also make sure you do an allergy test of about 1mg before taking the full dose, just in case of vendor mixup. (Did you reagent test it too?)


Have fun! :D

Thanks for the advice and info. I will allergy test it, probably planning on doing my first trial next weekend, since I don't celebrate Easter or 4/20 hahah. I'm not too sensitive to psychs, about average I think, as typical lsd blotter isn't strong enough for me unless I take two or three, and I see little value in mushrooms below about an 1/8th. I figure this chemical might be lacking heavily in any kind of mind expansion, which is why I'm opting for a 30mg dose over a 20mg dose (I also don't wana waste precious material on threshold effects) and I'm looking into it as a primarily recreational experience. I have not reagent tested it as of now.


One question, will an allergy test of a mg or two cause any kind of tolerance? If there are no effects within a couple hours would it still be possible to have my first trial?


Oh! And it looks like it will be difficult to get small amounts of powder out of the bag, weighed, etc. without making a mess and losing some. Any advice on how to handle it?


Thanks!

I love nearly all of the 2Cs that I have tried.  Unlike the psilocin and 5-MeO-DMT analogues which are essentially more of the same, the 2Cs are rich in that they are diverse.  They are all so different from one another if you think about...not even mentioning the 2C-Ts which are not only diverse, but downright unpredictable.


2C-C is a special one.  2C-C is the ONLY phenethylamine I have tried that really reminds me of mescaline, that really *feels* just like mescaline.  It's prolly the ONLY psychedelic you eat that I wished lasted longer.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Usually I wish most were shorter!


Anyway, 30mg of 2C-C is my standard 'museum level' dose, 40mg is nice(r) too and probably my favorite dose.  One night, a friend insisted he wished for 80mg after seeing some other BLers going up to 100mg....I took 60mg that night and....wow.  At that level 2C-C *almost* became challenging, it certainly enough was to keep me on my toes and remind me psychedelics can still show me who is boss, but I was still 'intensely relaxed'...60mg was strong but I could have done 80mg.  Doubt I will, I like 30mg -40mg range better....2C-E is for over-the-top trippin'.  Again, 2C-C was like mescaline in that seemingly no dose (I've had up to 700mg mescaline hcl) is ever too much to handle.


To weigh it, you need a small spatula...use a flat screw driver in the meantime to get the 2c-c out...weigh out a peice of rolling paper, or cut some paper to fit on the scale....weigh it three times....tare fresh each time, fuckers, to be safe here.


Say it weights 122mg.....remove the paper tare the scale to 0, put the paper back on and dump what you think is 30mg onto the paper using the screw driver head...and when it says 152mg on the first try, and you verify three times, taring to 0 each time cupcake, you know you rock....that's what we do around here and we do it 3 times cause around here the scales are accurate (reference weights that check down to 2mg...oh yes...tiny bits of foil essentially) but still cheap...no wind guard or level so if you are like me and like to do it right, down to the milligram.....or even microgram with proper dilution....ya verify, verify, verify followed by a jingle.  Oh you,


Mark the weight of your sample dish, or sample paper (I use rolling papers, usually 142mg or so) after checking three times and wiggling your tingly thing between your legs, yes that's yu too ladies.  Then add powder to paper or sample dish, or glass vial, or whatever you use...weigh three times, jingle and jizzle  ans you got it.


Now lay your head on the ground and let me step on it.

^ Great post MGS, agree 100% down to the doses. 30mgs for me was slightly above threshold, it's when you push the dose that 2c-c begins to shine. It has all that mental clarity and cool colored visuals that mescaline brings with zero bodyload for me and a short duration, though it doesn't have anywhere near the euphoria of mescaline IME. Even at 80mgs the duration rarely pushed past 4 hours but I do metabolize drugs pretty quickly. If you wanna play it safe go for 30mgs but IMO I don't think it's bad advice to jump in at 40mgs, 2c-c is probably the gentlest and smoothest 2c I've taken.

For me 20mg is a good dose for doing some light reading...the visuals are barely there so you don't have the problem of the words dripping off the page, while your headspace is slightly psychedelicized and everything you read sends your thoughts off on some interesting tangents.


The good thing about 2C-C's short duration is, you can do it on a work night and still go to bed at a reasonable time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So I finally tried 40mg of 2C-C on bicycle day, and it more than met my expectations. Two of my friends ingested 40mg each as well, and they were taken aback as well, as we all expected it to be less visual, etc. than it was. The visuals were short lived but very interesting, at times having strong tracers and after-images, which were quite interesting as we watched 2001: a space odyssey at the peak. I felt both relaxed and energized, as during the come-up I felt the need to move about and I paced frequently, but as the trip progressed I felt content to just sit. There was a slight nausea that one friend and I both experienced, I'd liken to being hungry yet being full at the same time; not like I was gonna puke, but like something was there. I felt a strong pressure in my head that wasn't necessarily painful, but was indeed noticeable and distracting. I would say I was fully back to baseline after about 6 hours total.


To be honest, the body load WAS less than my stronger mushroom trips as well as any of my LSD or 25i trips, lending me a certain love for this compound already, given its intriguing visuals coupled with a short duration and easy come-up. None the less, I wish it lasted longer and I want to push further with it, yielding the questions I have below.


My questions are these:

-If I push the dose to say, 50 or 60mg, would the nausea become noticeably stronger?

-If I push the dose to said levels, would the visuals last longer/become more pronounced?

-Is there any euphoria or revelations to be had raising the dose? I did feel some euphoria, and had revelations about the nature of life while watching 2001, but they weren't that strong.

-Are other 2C-x compounds similar in any ways? Such as body load, visuals, headspace, etc. I'm interested in both 2C-D and 2C-E, but I'm concerned that the body loads will be too strong, as I felt that 40mg of 2C-C was already a bit higher on the nausea scale than I expected.


Thanks for y'all's advice, this was my first 2C-x compound, and I loved the short but interesting trip it gave me. I feel that 2C-C will be a valuable friend to me in the future. Summer is almost upon us, woooo!

2C-D also has virtually no bodyload, in fact I found it to have even less.  2C-E has a strong body presence, which often feels body-like, uncomfortable, etc, but can also feel wonderfully glowing.  2C-E is the most psychedelic 2C-X in my opinion, one of the strongest psychedelics I have ever taken.  Extremely neutral in character.  Nothing at all like 2C-C for sure, I have a feeling 2C-D and 2C-E have a similar depth potential but I can't be sure because I haven't dosed 2C-D very high.

So I've recently obtained 2 50mg capsules of this stuff. I have some 2C-B experience (3 times, all around 25mg, great time every time) but have never had C before. Furthermore I've had shrooms about 8 years ago but I'm a relatively unexperienced psychedelics user. 

2 questions: 

Would 50mg be a little high for a first time on this stuff? I have capsules and a scale so I'm considering making new capsules at 40mg each and saving the remaining 20mg for later. 

A friend wants to trip with me but she's on a daily dose of Sertraline (an SSRI). A quick browse through this site/ google has not returned any info on possible risks/ interaction, anyone able to elaborate on whether this is a good/bad idea?

I recently took my second trip with this substance. My trip partner and I both agree, 50mg was very profound and stronger than expected, much stronger than a prior 40mg trip we took. You might wana keep this in mind.


I really like this substance so far, it is quite pleasant in almost every way IME.

SSRIs (like sertraline) will substantially dampen the effects of all serotonergic psychedelics (like 2C-C and pretty much every other psychedelic).  There is no danger in mixing but the dose required will be MUCH higher, and many of the effects will be blocked or muted.  This is true of most people, I have heard of people who still trip on SSRIs but most people have a hard time with it.

I have experience mucoid (mucish?) reactions to various RCs sniffed... I don't think it is unique to 2C-C. It is just what the nose dose (I mean "does") when offended.


This reaction did not occur after several days

of using the mucus membranes

of my handsome snout.

I guess it gives up.

Right, thanks for the help. Don't know when I'll be taking it yet, but will cut down to 40mg and find myself another trip partner who isn't on SSRIs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I took a test dose of 30mg, and ugh. This stuff made me sicker than a dog. I was really excited to try this compound after hearing of it's gentleness. Not gentle at all. Had me puking and dry heaving for 4 hours. I was getting dirty visuals akin to a dirty, broken and glitched out video camera lens. I'd feel myself become fever hot to ice cold and spent almost the whole trip curled into a ball wishing for it to end.


I understand this is an atypical reaction and I intend to reagent test to be sure it is 2c-C, but I thought this reaction should be noted.

Pretty disappointed, the chloro sounds like a great trick to add to the arsenal...

I tried 50mg of a batch of 2C-C I recently acquired last night... My God, how is this drug so overlooked?


 At 50mg, my mind was simply blown. The come-up for the first hour was a bit rough (as any psych seems to be) and then whamo, I was having full blown amazing visuals, seeing strands of light split and cross the room, seeing shadows and objects morph in queer ways. Of the RC's I have tried (4-HO-MET, 2C-C, 2C-D, MXE, M1, 25i) it is easily the most mind manifesting. My roommate and I were having deep, DEEP conversations about "God", life, the universe, society... It was sheer mental pleasure, debating the afterlife, the meaning of life, the ways we felt cut off from the rest of society.


 I cannot express just how awesome 2C-C is in relation to most any other psych I have tried (second only to LSD, and MAYBE to mushrooms... that's a hard debate for me). It was more similar to a decent acid trip than any other RC has ever been for me. The body effects were easy enough to handle, the mental effects were profound, and the visuals did not disappoint.


2C-C is one of the most overlooked gems, especially of the 2C-x compounds IMO. I think it would be a worthy addition to any psychonauts collection, and it would be an amazing first psychedelic in the right dosage for someone new to psychedelia. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

2C-C is a fascinating chemical. It lets you bend and transform the experience into any direction you so choose. I had a great fondness for that one. Unfortunately I only got to use it a few times but it never disappointed except for when we took it at a club. That was a disaster. Of epic proportions. But that was only because it was a gay club and the guy I was tripping with was very much uncomfortable with his sexuality and it just turned into a disaster. Even though it was a normal club night the fact it was a gay club was too much for him to handle and we left... Fortunately the chemical allowed me to push it to the back to drive us back to his place safely before it remanifested itself as soon as we got to his apartment. 


It's interesting that the higher doses just increase the duration of the total effects and not really the intensity. The intensity seems to plateau around 50mg and higher doses just last longer.

As far as being familiar with 2c compounds, yes, very much so. I have extensive experience with 2c-e,b and i.

2c-e being my all time favorite psych next to Lucy, and 2ci, which I've come to dislike very much over aprx.10 doses.

B reminded me of MDMA. 


So it's not like this was something like someone new to psychs, I am very aware of comparable body loads.


I gave some to a friend who promised to have it tested before they tried it, and low and behold, they dosed 30mgs.

One of the party reported the most intense visual and auditory trip of her life, and the other swore it was the best trip he'd had off of any other psych. Weird! Doesn't  sound like 2c-c to me. I saved 100mgs to test for

Myself so hopefully I'll be able to get this stuff tested to see what the culprit is, however it pans out, I'm doubting 2cc based on others as well as my own experience

^I doubt that's 2C-C as well man, I've never seen such a reaction from it. I've taken it with three other individuals, and none of the four of us have had any issues, even at 50mg. My friend took roughly 45mg and said he felt it to be a bit weak. I get an odd headache on the come up sometimes, but that seems constant from one 2C compound to the next.

Actually, I have a female friend who consistently puked on 2c-c and as for the temperature fluctuations, I've experienced these first hand. As far as visuals go, it's entirely subjective so I wouldn't be surprised if you did indeed receive 2c-c. 


Personally I really like 2c-c, it's very versatile and serves a nice compliment to other substances. It's definitely incredibly shallow however, and an attempt to get something meaningful out of it by dosing 80mgs just lead to a highly beautiful,  but still recreational trip. Funny enough, despite the mentions of dosage extending the duration, the trip was still over by the 4 hour mark, almost half of which was the come-up. I've never had a trip exceed the 4 hour mark, sometimes it's even over by the 3 hour mark.

My 2C-C trips have lasted closer to 5-6 hours on average with residual effects for another hour, and I actually find it to be quite psychedelic and mind-manifesting. I'm not sure what would explain this variance though. I do get temperature issues on it (sweaty nose, clammy palms, feet incapable of being warmed) but those are things I've experienced on every single psychedelic I've tried, particularly LSD... it's the physical and mental effects of 2C-C which make me liken it so much to LSD, almost like "LSD lite".

Yeah, as with all substances individual responses vary. Though with 2c-c all reactions in my group tend to be very similar, a recreational, short duration, low bodyload trip. I am slim with a rediculously fast metabolosm, however I don't think I've ever had someome trip longer than 5 hours. We also found it to lack the after-effects you speak of, it's a very "up and down" experience. When dealing with psychedelics, they're typically so unpredictable that variances in effects are extremely common... though 2c-c is widely regarded as a short duration, shallow experience.

It's certainly short, not 4 hours but I might have over stated the residual effects. Sleep is achievable 6-7 hours after dosing. It's certainly amazing recreationally, I just feel like its ability to aid in abstract thinking is overlooked. I also get "more" out of most psychs; my roommate doesn't feel the same as I do about 2C-C, and my best buddy back home doesn't feel like LSD is spiritual at all, while I feel like I'm touching God on LSD. I also have an uber metabolism, and am only 130lbs at 6'1". Also, it may be worth mentioning that only 10mg metocin trips me the hell out, when most need 20mg or more for strong effects. Perhaps I'm just more sensitive, I have no idea really.


I just wanted to express that I feel 2C-C's shallow reputation shouldn't discourage people from using it, as I've found it plenty deep for my purposes.

I haven't posted in a long time... After rereading this tread, and only trying 2c-c when it first came out a few years back, at 20mg (nice for hiking) & 35mg I thought it was worthless .. 


Well last night I tried 50mg... for me, it was very relaxing, sent me deep into my mind (witch help me greatly). So this dose helped me sort out some issues going on in my family... and It felt so good, there where waves of euphoria lots of visuals, clear thinking etc... 


Note: I never have had any sickness or purging etc... on any 2x or tryptamines .. except say  400+UG dose of LSD, witch makes my belly quiver, still I don't purge..  thankfully that feeling goes a way after hr...... 


Long story short... 2c-c is and has impressed me greatly like 2c-e... it is fun and therapeutic..

Lasted about 5hrs till I took a .5mg Xanax and 10mg Cyclobenzaprine to null its effects and fall to sleep quickly.... 


 Xanax and Cyclobenzaprine works well after taking a 300ug LSD dose Too; at about the 7th 0r 8th hr... as well... 


Note: I have no tolerance to Xanax & Cyclobenzaprine I only use them about 3 times a year... same with psychedelics...\

 I don't drink at all!  I do smoke cannabis for medical reasons... and for fun...


I do thank this tread for inspiriting me to partake last night in this mescaline type RC what a wonderful chemical 2c-c is...

I took some yesterday, it was very impressive. At some stage I was alone in my room in the dark, enjoying a crazy body high, and my thoughts were kind of visual, if it makes sense. But all of a sudden everything became dark and worrying, I almost had a panic attack. I hadn't seen it coming. I turned on the light, stood up, took a deep breath, and the fear vanished. The experience was much deeper than I had expected. I had crazy visuals, looking at paintings was particularly inspiring. Today I have the feeling I didn't act carefully enough, I was expecting something much gentler.

Glad you liked it, great substance. I've never had a headache the next day, but headaches aren't uncommon towards the tail end of phenethylamines. Drink alot of water and take some acetaminophen/paracetamol and you should be fine ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh 2C-C, how I miss you...


About a year ago my friend and I had the chance to acquire a large amount of what was claimed to be 2C-C. I've done 2C-C numerous times from different batches/sources and this new stuff was different. Balls to the walls intense at 55mg (oral). Typically 2C-C is very fun and "just right" at that level. I have no idea what it was. A total of 6 people tried it on different occasions; 4 of us had similar "super intense" trips and the other 2 had moderate-strong trips. (those 2 are known to have high tolerance). It felt like a PEA and actually felt pretty clean too. Felt almost roll-like on the comeup. Probably fine at lower doses, but definitely took me for a surprise.


The vendor swears it's 2C-C, even though marquis/mecke/mandelin indicate otherwise.


![s3m0qf.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi61.tinypic.com%2Fs3m0qf.jpg&hash=cb89738a75ea41c7d550b54da3ccdf29)


I want to put this information out there in case anyone comes across this stuff. They're one of the few vendors I know of still selling what's claimed to be 2C-C. Be sure to test your goods! The 2C-C I know and love is the one on the left labeled OLD BATCH.

Yeah give them a try, they even give out free test kits, but you obviously already have them, but they even have some unclaimed from last month so they can use all the publicity they can get. 


Apparantly they get ZERO funding while their government spends billions fighting the war on drugs, they couldn't care less if their kid gets whathever is being passed as molly over there, OD's on a new super potent noid in a 'legal high' blend or people running naked in the streets on Flakka...lol...


Let us know what it turns out to be, I'm curious if it might be an other phenetylamine, did it feel like a 2c? 55mg of almost any other of it's more common cousins (perhaps not 2c-d) would be VERY intense indeed...


Brr makes me think of that bromo-dragon-FLY incident,  you sould ideally have it tested or start with a very low dose, but I must admit to not doing so myself in some cases like when I order a stimulant but most psychedelics I would try a 'speck' perhaps a mg, not that that is a good guideline..![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Yeah, I'm really thankful that it (apparently) didn't turn out to be something harmful. I'd rather not think about what would happen if someone mixed up 2C-C with 25C-nbome.


It definitely wasn't 2C-D, 2C-E, or 2C-B. I could maaaaybe believe 2C-I; I did 2C-I once at 18mg which resulted in a mildish trip. I suppose it felt like what I might expect a strong 2C-I trip to feel like, but then again, the test kit results don't match up. Likewise for the 2C-T series.


It makes me wonder whether there are some uncommon variants of these things floating around as a way for manufacturers to cover their ass. 2C-C-Fly anyone?


I'm hoping to find time for another trial of the "pseudo 2C-C" this weekend; this time at 15mg instead of 55mg.

25mg lasted only about 3 hours; one of my shortest trips. I'll have to dose higher next time. Slight stomach discomfort at the peak.

Dosed 47 mg on monday.. it was absolutely wonderful! 


Amazing CEV as well as slightly less intense OEV of structures with serrated edges, spiritual elation...


I took my normal dose of - I think - 150+75 mg Lyrica that day, on the comeup I felt my back/kidneys for about 5-10 minutes and thought "hm hope everything is okay in there"... but it was otherwise gentle on the body and mind..


Enjoyed the big garden in my new home, listening to Bach was heavenly, one of the latest episodes of Louie really LOLWTFed me (soundtrack: [listen.. those lyrics.. lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcUKDIfwAQ4)). And yes 2C-C lasts only a very short while. I am happy that I got a stash of fresh 2C-C, I am really motivated to trip a lot more!! At the very least 2C-C has a low negative impact if any for me. So very sustainable. Candy ish. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) But of course don't abuse it.

Hello,


Yesterday I dosed 45mg of 2C-C, which was very pleasant ! Very gentle psychedelic, however today I have a really horrible headache since this morning.


Is this a common side effect from the 2C-C ?


I plan to redose tomorrow aswell with some MDMA ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Of course this is wild speculation out of the blue, but probably this could have been this 2C-TFM / 2C-I mix (failed synthesis) that was around several years ago (I'm too lazy to do a search right now, but I think there is even a big&dandy thread about this stuff somewhere in bluelight PD). But please don't quote me on that!

The other day I've tried 15mg intranasal of the HCl salt, causing an extreme pain that was noticed until +01:00. The duration of the experience was not reduced at all. This pain never happened to be so intense/long with 2C-B. Intranasal administration of 2C-C is not recommended.

The only 2C-x that I ever insufflated was 2C-C -- about ten times over the course of about seven trips, in turn over the span of about a month. The dosages ranged from 10mg to 30mg.


To be sure, this chemical is intensely caustic on the nasal passages, but I wouldn't describe the burn-like sensation as painful. Rather, I would say that it's *really* unpleasant. Imagine snorting industrial-grade powdered bleach... And yes, the feeling lasts 30-60 minutes; meanwhile, your nose and eyes become faucets of mucus and water, and the coughing seems unstoppable... and you trip balls on top of it all. It's gnarly, but in hindsight, kind of funny.


Anyhow, all of my 2C-C trips before and after these intranasal experiments were conducted using oral ROA. With one exception, the dosages for those ranged from 30mg to 60mg, with 50mg being my preferred dose. The exception consisted of a 100mg test. This was done in order to assess NBOMe-induced tolerance; I had taken 25D-NBOMe just a few days earlier. The trip was probably comparable to a 70-75mg one. It was completely manageable, but it did yield some tachycardia and considerable nystagmus. Lastly, all of the oral trips endured about twice as long as the intranasal ones.

I dunno if it's me. But woman look so much more beautiful on this substance. Normally I find around 5% of them actractive while I'm on 2C-C I find almost 60 to 70% atractive almost all of them look like angels with tinkling eyes. It blew my freaking mind how big that difference was.


Someone else had this too?

I fed my SO their third psychedelic ever this weekend, 2C-C...we each took 45mg.  Now this is the same 2C-C I've always had, acquired way back in 2004.


Both of us had an intense and somewhat difficult comeup, something I've never experienced before on 2c-C.  C ended up vomiting about 2 hr in.  But after that, it smoothed out for both of us.  At about 3hr in, C went outside and 15 min later came in and described an experience that I would call a ++++.  A 'meeting with water (element).'  Language used included being 'one with the universe.'


I love 2c-C.  I was surprised it gave C flirtations with ++++.  I thought it would be a milder and more recreational experience.  We both are excited to work our way up to 2C-E.  Discovering the psychedelics all over with a psychedelic virgin is heavenly.  Thank you Shulgin!

Hi initram,


Welcome to PD / Bluelight ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Have you checked pillreports and ecstasydata? I am not finding anything so far for UK, but there are pink/red hexagons with suspected 2C-B..

[http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=33285](http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=33285)

[http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=32963](http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=32963)


Pink seahorses with suspected 2C-B:

[http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=28877](http://www.pillreports.net/index.php?page=display_pill&id=28877)


I myself have only had standard flat small pink 2C-B pills many years ago in the Netherlands..

And also orange 2C-B pills with crown logo on them.


When in doubt, get tested at say Wedinos!

At 35mg 2C-C doesn't even begin getting psychedelic for me, it's just a mild body sensation and a slight flutter of visuals then it's over. I'll probably never use less than 40mg of it again unless I'm combining it with something else.

You might have some unusual sensitivity to it...30mg for most people will only produce a strong ++.


I've shared 2C-C with at least a half dozen people and all found it gentle and favorable in the 40-50mg range, one hard-head took 80mg and said he could have done 100mg.  I find 50-60mg to suit my tastes personally.

This one feels like it would be excellent combined with other psychedelics, since it doesn't bring anything really to surface and has no strong side-effects. Anyone able to share experiences and doses with LSD/Shrooms/4-aco-dmt/4-ho-met? Interested with the likes of LSD how it would be best to combine the two given LSD's longer duration.


This is a brilliant psy for when you just have a bit of free time but don't want to have a serious personal review etc. 20-25mg for first time dose, but I find this stuff really starts to shine at 30mg and just makes whatever you are doing more engrossing.

I had my first 2C-C experience last weekend, together with friends dosed 18mg for the girlfriend who was playing with my traktor library, she had some pretty intense visuals, saw us wearing glasses, spiders, clouds and at some point little dragons began popping out of the mixer and snap at her lol.. It seems she is rather sensitive to psychedelics and will have to keep this in mind and give her treshold doses to begin with.


I myself decided after adding another 25mg that this was to be a muliti stage rocket and added about 20mgs of 2C-D and another 15mg of 2C-C at this stage it felt like the ideal clubdrug for I was having the time of my life dancing, while she was surprising me with some of the tunes I have been collecting in the last few years and at time joining her to chat a bit or check what tune she was playing or to chase away some pesky little dragons so she could carry on. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


For me visuals were present when not focussing on the music or in other places like the toilet, but never very defined, it reminded me of a low dose 4-HO-MET but indeed with some sedation and a very uninhibited state I was even a little bit wobbly at times so that wouldn't be ideal in a club setting.. This could have been the 4mg flubromazepam I had for my muscle tension, which normally doesnt have a pronounced effect. (I know it dampens the trip but its safer than a beta blocker and lack of strong visuals would make it even more functional in a club setting) 


I gave the remaining 25mg to the other friend who was a bit quiet at the time which is nothing like him so in the super mood I was in I hoped it would do the same for him, but unfortunately he found it too intense visually after a while and he had bad nausea for a few hours and finally asked me for a benzo for it to stop because it was to much for him.


For me I think I have found a new friend less wave like in intensity than 2C-B and it is very euphoric while relaxing in a way but still it invites you to dance and has a smooth consistent action which besides a sort of drunken swagger at higher doses.. It seems this is going to be my new clubbing favorite. Me like a lot!


Has anybody experienced a wobbliness on a high dose of 2C-C?


Edit: will see next time when taken on it's own as I have ordered a gram of this gem of a chem.

Do you do anything special for preservation? Or just keep it in normal room temperature?

I just keep em in glass vials (sealed tight) with a rock or two of desiccant in the powder.  Even the tryptamines I have are stored this way these days (those I used to keep frozen but no longer an option) and they all seem to not ever degrade.  Some of them (tryptamines) are a bit darker (my 4-OH-Ts), but not much...and yet others (such as a-MT, 5-MeO-X, and others) have kept their white color.

I had my first experience with 2C-C last night and was quite  disappointed. Trying to pinpoint what might have gone wrong if anything. 


I  took what I believed to be 24mg orally in a solution. I am male, 61kg  (135 pounds) so I don't usually need large dosages of  chemicals but perhaps my body requires a larger dose of 2C-C. Not on any  medications. I hadn't eaten in about 6 hours. After about 30 minutes I  felt as if I was on the way up. I went for a walk and I felt slightly  dazed or disorientated, was in a mildly pleasant headspace but not what I  would call high or tripping. Came home and took a shower at about +90  minutes which was nice but nothing out of the ordinary. At times I felt  completely sober, and other times it felt like the comeup on MDMA. Then  all of a sudden I was back at baseline. I felt relaxed, but nothing  more. No altered perceptions, no body buzz, nothing. This was ~3 hours  after dosing. 


Was I expecting too much from this dose? I never  really felt high, or as though I peaked or even plateaued at all. Just a  mildly altered headspace during the comeup and then nothing.


Here are some of my thoughts about what might have happened:


*  I had decided to dump my bag of 2C-C into vodka since I don't entirely  trust my .001g scales (new scales are on the way). I measured 244mg of  2C-C (was sold to me as 200mg so I'm confident this was relatively  accurate) and dissolved it into 10mL of vodka. Everything seemed to  dissolve properly but I'm wondering if I didn't use enough vodka to  dissolve this amount of 2C-C. I couldn't see any solid particles in the  solution so presumably this means it had dissolved properly?


* I  had experienced some stomach discomfort in the hours leading up to  dosing. I had some ginger tea to help with the discomfort but I'm  wondering if whatever was going on down there hampered absorption of the  drug.


* I was in a relatively good mindset, having the house to  myself and no pressing matters to deal with. I have a stressful job and  suffer from mild anxiety and depression so perhaps this interfered with  the experience.


* The 2C-C was from a source with a good  reputation, but I have no idea as to the actual purity of the product.  It was a chalky, fluffy white powder.


Any ideas or suggestions?  Should I try a higher dose? Should I try plugging? Everything I read  about 2C-C makes it sound like a drug I would enjoy. I find even weed is  too stimulating or intense for me these days, so the idea of a light,  short-duration experience is something I was excited to experience. But  at 24mg my expectations were not met. Wondering where to go from here.

For me, I first tried 2C-C twice way back in like 2006, when I was first starting to really get into psychedelics beyond occasional mushroom trips.  I had no tolerance buildup, and I tried it at 40mg orally, and also 50.  Both experiences seemed lacking, not fully developed.  A bit visual, a definite body high, but nothing I wished to repeat.  Fast-forward to a few months ago.  I took 32mg orally before a show (JRAD, one of the better shows I've ever seen).  I now have a general permatolerance from tripping so much in the intervening years, and I consider myself a hardhead now, unlike then, when I tended to need the dosage ranges recommended by Shulgin/Erowid.   Well, that 32mg gave me a NICE trip, quite intricately visual, similar to 2C-B-'s visuals but less colorful and much more fractallized and detailed.  I felt some empathogenesis and euphoria, and also quite a bit more mental psychedelia than 2C-B.  It seemed most similar to 2C-B than to anything else, but I liked it better for sure.  Not sure why it hit me so much better recently, and at a lower dose.  But if I come across it again, I'd be happy to take it, it was a great trip.


I'd recommend going higher next time, unless you had any symptoms that were alarming.  It sounds like you were just underwhelmed, and for 2C-C, 24mg is a pretty low dose.  Those halfway in trips can be uncomfortable.

I find 2C-C's threshold to be at 40mg personally, that's where I actually start tripping and it can get quite fun with some herb.


YMMV, don't jump in at higher doses till you've tried lower ones; with that said, I find it shines at 50-55mg.

Everyone is different in some ways, but I think 24 mg is too low to have the experience you want to achieve. You can easily double your oral dose of 2c-c, it is a safe chemical in such low dosage. It might be you will find that 48mg is low but then you will know what to do next.

First time I took 2c-c I used 100mg plugged over the night with the same in MXE. 


This definatly has the potential for more than a "light" psychedelic. It was one of the most intense/important trips I have had.


Took it a few more times at lower doses and it wasnt the same. This one is on my shortish list of things to reaquire

When reading these high dosages, I think it's important to remember that not everyone will handle it as smoothly. Here's a case where bad side effects were felt at 75mg, so work up slowly.

Generally people seem to push 2C-C since it seems ever forgiving. I've pushed it to 55mg and I can say it's a full on trip at that point. I'll probably try 60mg some time but likely not move past that.

I should also be more clear I reached the ~100mg mark with 3 (maybe 2? I forget) doses over the course of the night. I am also naturally hardeaded.


As always YMMV

I'm looking to pick up a gram of 2c-c from my vendor pretty soon, is this drug really as relaxed as people make it seem?

I love 2c-e but I don't like the extreme muscle tension that comes along with it, after a trip is done I usually have a headache and pain in my legs from unconsciously contracting my muscles, I get the same effect from DOC but never LSD or psilocybin.

It's pretty relaxed, I find 2C-B more relaxing but 2C-C is also really nice.  Smooth on the body.

^^I never have bad after effects with 2C-C like you described about 2C-E Holy Toast.


Anyways, a gram of 2C-C is only like, 20 doses if you generally dose it around 50mg (which is about where I like it) and thus isn't that much. It's a very impotent 2C.

Yesterday i took 50mg. I was a very light experience... nearly no visual, just some bright in colors and sometype of fog/mist outside at night. It has nearly no bodyload, just a little bit on the comeup.


As everyone said before it is relaxing and not demanding. Watching movie and talking was very easy. I also felt on the come up and first 2.30 hours somekind of erotic sphere.


It pairs very good with weed, i had N2O also but did not tryed i was very satisfaced as i was.


There was nothing remarkable of the experience, did not touch my mind or my soul. But next day i feel full of happyness and energy. Sleeping was very easy after about 6 hours.


My previous experiences are : Loads and hard experiences with weed, GHB, LSA, LSD, Ald-52, eth-lad, 2c-b-fly..


Any question i would be happy to answer.

Vaporized 5-8mg freebase 2C-C, harsh vapor. It's not fun. Just throws all that muscle discomfort into a tense 60 seconds, but it still persists afterwards. The normal 2C-C visuals are there. Clear headspace, but you're tripping. Total duration = 1 hour.

Hi All,


Got a nice reaction on my 2C-C after acquiring from a new vendor (new to me anyway after our favourite Eastern Europe vendor had to take a break). Pleased to see this as I got 2G ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Tried this one last night at 55mg, lovely evening, dissolved in some tonic water. I got some nice visuals and it was a very peaceful and chilled experience. As it has been said before it synergises really well with cannabis. I was vaping high quality herb and very potent oil. 


I will have had some tolerance from the 4-HO-DPT the night before, I normally don't do things so close together but I am going to be away from home for two months so wanted to try it.


This is has to be my favourite 2C-x out of 2C-D, 2C-E and 2CB-FLY. I haven't tried the others but so far I really like this one, sort of the 4-ACO-MET of the 2C series. Looking forward to a higher dose next time as I felt it has even more to offer.


I think this one would be a good one for the daytime at a festival and will try in August and report back.

Yeah 2C-C really is so nice.  I find it to be the most similar to 2C-B of any of the 2Cs, but more mentally psychedelic and more crisp and less colorful in the visual department.  Not quite as euphoric and emotional as 2C-B either, but a little clearer and less fuzzy too, but besides that a pretty overall similar mindstate.  I actually only took 32mg the last time I took it and went to a show, and I had a great time and it was surprisingly quite visual.


I also got 2 grams recently. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Haven't tried it yet from this batch but I may actually take a bit today, not sure yet.

Has anyone combined this one with 4-ACO-DMT or 4-ACO-MET? I was thinking all three in combo might be interesting or too much.


found a report on erowid that I will check out.

^I've only combo'd it with MXE and cannabis; mixed poorly with MXE.


2C-C is an odd one; at 35mg I generally can't get visuals and get very little but discomforting effects, but at 40mg+ it gets extremely visual and has a deep-ish head space. I've seen 40mg floor one person while I've been completely bored with 40mg. Other times 40mg has been plenty. Not sure what it is. I find the sweet spot to be there between 40-50mg. Didn't like going past 50mg, haven't tried past 60mg, and never tried less than 30mg (30mg was a major dud).

I've once combined 20mg 4-AcO-DMT with 20mg 2C-C (dosed at the same time). They complimented each other nicely, the 2C-C seemed to add some neon-colored details to the CEV's of the 4-AcO-DMT.

Yes, I combined it with 4aco-dmt once but found that it felt as if the 2 chemicals where trying to battle with each other rather than play well. This could be down to setting and subsequent body load issues but it didn't stand out to me as being that nice.


I have found 2c-c to go very well with LSD, MDMA, Ketamine, Nos. (not all in one big combo obviously)


For me 2c-c is a great chemical to reacquaint oneself with with the psychedelic experience after a long break. Gentle enough on the body and mind yet has the potential to be quite visual with a decent amount of depth and magic. The short duration is a big bonus for me to, I can dose after dinner time and still get to bed on time and not be too drained the following day.

It certainly is lovely. Nice to know it goes well with those classics. I don't see the point of combining with other 2C-x, I combined 2C-D with 2CB-FLY which was nice but thinking about it wouldn't try it again. I will try it with a tryptamine but I am not sure which ones. 4-ACO-MET might play nice. I have 4-ACO-DET/DMT/MET/MIPT and 4-HO-MET/DET/DPT/EPT to play with but will take some time as I don't like want to spoil the magic by using them too often.


I am sure they is a golden combo somewhere in that lot. But to be honest it is nice on its own as long as you don't go in expecting something different.


maybe it is down to ratios why some have good combos and others don't, will take a lot of research to find the ultimate ratios and I am sure it will be different for everyone. Too many variables.

2c-c is my favorite 2c-x (only tried c, e and low dose p). A bad trip is VERY unlikely. I also like 2c-e very much, but 2c-c does not have physical side effects, so it is a clear winner in my book. And the duration is so short, that trips do not need planning (if you have many social constraints).

I had my birthday weekend this weekend, so I went a little harder than usual and took a psychedelic 2 days in a row.  I decided to do 2C-C, I got some recently and haven't had it in quite some time, but I remembered it to be very good, similar to 2C-B but perhaps even preferable for me.  On Friday I had taken some propylhexedrine which had me feeling good, and I took 20mg of 2C-C on top of it, got a really nice, warm, wonderful buzz, and then took 20mg more, all orally, maybe 2 hours later.  I was hanging out with my girl and we just had the greatest evening... we were both just brimming over with love (she didn't take any but knew I was and was definitely feeling my vibe I think).  It was really profound, just feeling gratefulness for what we have.  I was moved to tears, although it was much more akin to an MDMA experience than a psychedelic one, though surely the propyl which is a releaser was a big part of that.  Very clear-headed, less side effects than propylhexedrine on its own, they combined really nicely indeed.  I slept fine, I also mixed some alcohol with it, not a whole lot but wow, what a great combo.  I think I recall people talking years ago about how 2C-C has a special synergy with alcohol and I can concur that this is true for me.  Interestingly, I also find DOC to have a very special synergy with alcohol.  I felt warm and fuzzy and just absolutely euphoric in this very centered and beautiful way. 


Then the next day I was going out to see a show by one of my favorite bands these days at an outdoor downtown day festival.  An hour before leaving for it (my friend was driving and I was at his house), I took 40mg of 2C-C all at once, and a 10mg booster an hour and a half after that (which just prolonged it as far as I can tell).  It started to hit me quite fast, within a half hour it became strong to the point of visuals and a decidedly psychedelic headspace, despite having had it the day before also.  We were watching a video of Radiohead from the Base, The King of Limbs.  I had a really profound musical experience watching it.  I find with more recent Radiohead albums, I have actually disliked them the first few times hearing them, but then over time grown to love them.  I hadn't made the switch with The King of Limbs yet, but I certainly did on Saturday.  I couldn't believe I had listened to the album multiple times and thought it was boring.  The rhythmic stuff they're doing is fucking crazy and next level.  I think it helped watching them actually playing this stuff, and how much they were rocking out.  I understood the music so intimately, I felt like I could hear so many nuances in it, 2C-C is a great music enhancer I have found.


Then we went to the show, and I had a couple of beers throughout the night.  The band was incredible, so funky, I hadn't seen them for a while and they've improved since I last saw them.  I danced so hard, I found I could move my body in complex ways that were really satisfying and responding to the nuances of the beat well.  I would say that 2C-C increased my appreciation for music and my ability to be hyper-aware of everything going on better than most psychedelics, it reminded me of how 2C-E does in a way but less intensely.  My awareness felt very sharp.  But the most unique effect was how much it increased my understanding of complex rhythms.  Very intriguing.  I felt a strong euphoria all night and I felt very sociable and confident and carefree, which reminds me of DOC also.  There really are more similarities than I had once detected.  I started dropping off the peak after maybe 2.5 hours, but I still felt moderately strong effects for a while after that and I had a wonderful glow the whole rest of the night.  Also, decidedly pro-erotic.


Overall, I have to say I really love 2C-C, I feel like I got to know it a lot better over the weekend.  40mg of 2C-B would get me to a similar level of intensity I think, I really do find 2C-C about the same level of potent.  I find the trip more psychedelic, but less visual than 2C-B, but still pretty visual.  They have a similar feeling of warm, comfy body feel and a very open and loving mindset, but I really like the increased clarity and crispness of the 2C-C state.  I haven't had 2C-B in years, but from memory, I currently prefer 2C-C.

Does anyone agree with me that most 2c-c doses posted online are too low and lead to people being underwhelmed. It really only begins to shine at high doses and it's quite benign psychically so the side effects don't get out of hand. However the visuals are turned up to  11, while it's still more on the recreational side there is more head space and the dose response curve is linear so no nasty surprises?

Probably so, for me I actually find it to be of similar potency to 2C-B, so 40mg is a really nice trip, visual and emotional, similar to 2C-B but deeper.  I'm certainly going to try it at 50mg and 60mg.  I have no fear of this as it's extraordinarily comfortable.  I also want to try 2C-B at the same dosages, as I find 30mg of it to be quite underwhelming and 40mg to be starting to get good.

I find it worthless below 40mg, so yeah, I think most of the doses you see on erowid and such are too low.


That's by no means meant to be an endorsement to jump in at 40mg if you've never tried it before. Safety first!

I had visuals with 25mg. Max dose was 45mg and it's very comfortable like Xorkoth said. This chem is wonderful and don't feel harmful. I'll probably try it again ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

If you find other phenethylamine good for sex, then I would say probably yes.  Personally I get issues with performance on pretty much any phenethylamine or amphetamine (or stimulant), but with 2C-C it's much less than most.  Tryptamines and lysergamides on the other hand...

3-MeO-PCP is the only disso that doesn't seem to affect it strongly for me.  As for psychs, lysergamides are great for sex, so are tryptamines if you aren't too far in.  A few phenethylamines are okay, but all of them I've encountered (even 2C-B) affect the ability to get it up at least somewhat.  Stimulants do that to me too.  Any serotonin releaser or dopamine reuptake inhibitor will cause a near-total inability to perform.  GABAergics are good for it though, especially phenibut.

Tried ~22mg the other day.


I think there was some slight colour enhancement, and a shower felt extraordinarily good on the skin. Could of course have been placebo... I had taken 12.5 mg of Oxazepam (approx equivalent to 5mg Diazepam) some time before that, so I had to take a nap at the 2 hour mark, and after waking up like 90 minutes later the effects were pretty much gone.


I wasn't expecting anything mind-blowing at 22 milligrams, especially after consuming a small benzo dose beforehand, but it really goes to show that Shulgin was pretty conservative when it came to dosages if I was barely at +1 at that point.


I wonder if I should go for 40 to 50 mg for my next time. I'm actually worried mostly about the entactogenic effects - I've only had lysergamide psychedelics before, so I'm kind of worried about sending thirsty text messages to female acquaintances rather than being transfixed by fractal visuals and novel thoughts.

2C-C is nice, and I would imagine it to be nice for sex, but it doesn't really make me horny or anything.  Kinda like LSD, except LSD is much better for sex.  But with LSD I don't start thinking about sex, but if sex happens, it's wonderful for it.

^Regarding those matters, 2c-c is inherently stimulating (so there is that aspect of it as an aphrodisiac... it's just more 'sedating' than most PEA's I'm assuming but it will keep you awake if you're tired, that's for sure). 


There is another more profound aspect to it that would enhance this fun filled animalistic activity. 2c-c really helps me to sense other people's energy - not only would this enhance sex, but it enhances, clarifies, advances any social human interaction that is had. It is so enjoyable in this sense. For example, I am chatting with my foxy girl who I have a total crush on, after our morning shift, and we got chatting about her assignment (I'm really interested in what she's doing, it's for gender studies). So, she is explaining to me all these things about it, but I sense a subtle flirty undertone to her voice. She is totally being a flirt... she does this a lot, but she is a shy extrovert when it comes to dating so she is always so subtle about it. Takes a fucking headfull of 2c-c to figure out what she is saying, which is pretty much "I want you to ask me on another date" lol.  I always notice that, when she speaks to me in the morning after our night shift. Her voice alone is making me horny (she's not just tired... although it's cute when she likes that too) because of this. So assuming you have that type of environmental encouragement (I don't really,,, lol... I have not had sex on 2c-c before) it would be really awesome for that! Depending on your reaction to 2c-c as well.


I feel honoured and responsible to speak on behalf of this powerful Sacred Key to the inner sanctum of the mind. I have been tripping on 2c-c for a month, so I feel qualified to speak on It's behalf. 2c-c will always hold a special place in my hard, after just finishing up my 3 grams of it. It is the only psychedelic I can function in any way at all on (unless the dose is really high... then it becomes a beautiful sensory experience that is interactive but also immersive). Generally speaking, at common doses with mild to moderate visual activity I can function just fine. As in, perform great at my job, have lovely conversations with beautiful women, go out for a walk around the neighbourhood and take 30 random photographs of natural activity in the suburban environment you never noticed before. It almost forces an attention to details upon your surroundings, or whatever you are thinking about. It makes my mind like an analytical laser that can slice through predefined social constructs, and build my reality from the ground up.


How it retains one's sense of logic and control over the body, as well as focus and awareness is what makes it such an amazing tool, especially those with analytical minds who might be stuck in black and white thinking, seeing the world in terms of mathematics if you studied too much physics and get caught up in some existential crisis unable to even see the world around you anymore. 2c-c can help you break free of anything. It helped me destroy my attachment to a 5 year heroin habit, as I was in the early stages of recovering from that while using it. 


My past month has been highly productive. I am recording myself playing guitar for the first time, and I have new ideas for the band I want to create and participate in its blossoming. I got into photography, as the world around me has become too beautiful to bare. I have somehow attracted the most beautiful fox of a woman I have ever met in my life into daily conversation and flirting, as well as having a second date planned with her. 2c-c made me highly analytical of the situation, she is a very tricky girl, and it's not sociopathic or anything like that... its just like how can I best go about this? Oh right... by just being myself and asking her questions too; taking an interest in her which I have anyway. 2c-c has straightforward answers to complex issues like that. 


The drug's visual activity is very nice. That is all subjective, but I tend to see a computer screen that has depth, mild morphing, and lots of pastel hues of colour like yellow, green, and pink. It has nowhere near the visual activity of dmt. Whatever dmt taps into, this has nothing to do with that. (DMT is my other favourite psychedelic, and between the two, I wouldn't ever need to use anything else to get what I want out of psychs... although I am still down to experiment haha).


Also, on 2c-c, I hate to see things neglected. I brought a century old antique family heirloom clock of of dust in the darkest corner of the basement to my newfound shrine as its centrepiece, surrounded by candlelight. I took not of old creepy looking dolls and placed them in a suitable area of my acidfreak lair so I could keep an eye on them, so that someone would experience observing them, as someone went to all that work to create them half a century ago, and then my deceased grandfather likely bought them for my aunt. When I go outside, I don't like to see how humans don't take care of the environment as well as they should. 


Although it is sort of a blank slate, and whatever you are doing or thinking about shapes the trip, 2c-c can be used for deep meditative practice. For example, I will mention one thing that happened to me on 2c-c. My foxy friend got all sick with the flu on my before our second date. I hadn't heard from her in a day. I was worried about her. She wanted to be alone, the only thing I could do to help was play her an improvised song on guitar. So, I focussed all my energy on her as a whole, I was experiencing nothing but this fox and who she is to me. My body evaporated, there were no thoughts, but No-Mind. Laser sharp focus on one specific thing. Then, I felt a beam of energy shoot out of the top of my head like a rainbow. Moments later she contacted me, letting me know she had been puking for the past day. That really tripped me out it was like cosmic telepathy! Lil Peep said that when you die, energy can't be destroyed and there is a beam, or something, like he didn't know what to call it but it comes out of the top of your head (in a posthumous interview). So I began to reflect on this.


2c-c is really good for going off on tangents, but it never lets you forget the original thought. It is excellent for learning, reading, socializing, working, anything really. At least for myself, there were definitely a few times when I took way too much and couldn't function. I had to have my friend talk me down for 2 hours and help convince myself I was going to be okay one time. I had a panic attack, but as a research chemical I needed to make sure that is what it was. So, tread with caution even though this drug is of relatively low potency compared to other research chemicals. It is still extremely potent, especially when snorted (and burns like hell, but hits within minutes). 


I could write forever about this psychedelic. It has really helped me see myself for who I am, and work on acceptance. It is also great for multitasking. I have been typing this while flirting with my foxy friend so I should play some Lil Peep and get back to that... she requires my attention at the moment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Couldn’t agree more 50/50 with 2C-D created my only plus +4 in a festival situation, for harm reduction I wouldn’t advise unless you are used to powerful experiences in public but this was perfect bliss sat under a tree in the rain. As you said low potency but incredibly powerful. The afterglow has lasted months. 10mg 2C-B-Fly and 250mg mescaline hcl was a close second.

2C-C has a very special place in my heart.  I find it similar to 2C-B but much more "crisp" and a more profound headspace.  It's euphoric, fees very nice in the body, is a great music enhancer, doesn't inhibit sociability, and it's very nicely visual.  Literally every time I do it, the trip focuses on honest self-analysis that comes from a loving place.  Every time I get some insights into myself.  At the same time, it's quite recreational.  I find it only very slightly less potent than 2C-B, but the trip is more psychedelic so I actually get a fuller trip from 30mg of 2C-C than I do from 30mg of 2C-B, although 2C-B is a little more fuzzy and euphoric.


I've taken 2C-C up to 42mg, and it was great at that level, but I've also had 30mg trips that were just as strong.  One of these days I want to go for like 60mg, I bet it would be great.

^Try 50mg Xork, it's pretty visual while not becoming anxiogenic, at least it was for me. Then again I had a friend say 40mg was almost too much.


I've taken it up to 55mg if my memory serves me, and I recall it being quite intense, yet still leaving room for more. Maybe I too will try 60mg soon ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

I've taken it at 80mg without a tolerance, and the visuals were crazy. It wasn't so analytical at that point... more of an immersive experience with a unique headspace that retains its "sharp" quality but I was just too high to be analyzing my life anymore haha. I still managed to visit my girlfriend at the time at her doctor's appointment and appear normal... until we got outside and I had to stop and look at the graffiti. It doesn't last too long either that can be nice. In terms of sheer intensity it was for me at that dose similar to lsd, but with a very different character and body high. 


I prefer it at lower doses, like 30 - 50mg. It definitely feels great, there is a stimulating body high and after a month of pretty much habitual use there was no comedown. However, I know that I will never be the same. Everything is different now, down to the way I perceive the sense of sight. It is a practical drug... does not just give you philosophical insights. With the power of analysis one can build on the experience it catalyzes, and powerful life changes can manifest. I have seen my actual life transform before my very eyes into something much more energy, active, and beautiful. It has a positive push most of the time, although there have been times when I really got questions deep concerns and became lost. It was never bad or anything. 


My favourite psychedelic along with DMT as those are the ones that I get the most out of and enjoy the most too. This one has a crazy headspace before the visuals really pick up, but the headspace is sane. I feel almost more sober on this drug. The messages I have learned are quite simple, I have completely restructured my mind and the way I see myself and the world around me. It definitely has a cosmic potential too, but you must work with that energy because it is almost like a blank slate... the high, like everything else, is what you create and make of it. 


One experience I had was that I hadn't heard from my friend I am crushing hard on a day, knowing she had been sick. We have a delightful connection. I focussed all my energy on her as a whole, and a beam of radiant, clear white light burst out of the top of my head like a rainbow. Mind was like a laser beam throughout this. I was somewhere outside my physical form while this happened. Moments later she randomly contacted me telling me she had been puking most of the day before. I was sending her as much compassion and positivity as I possibly could.

For me the two went well together! On many occasions I would take LSD and if I feel underwhelmed I would add some 2c-c. I have also done the same but starting out with 2c-c and later adding LSD. Increased development of visuals and for me anyway, it adds a smooth, calmer edge to everything that LSD alone wouldn't have for me.

This is one of my favourites and helped me through a rough time in life. Went through 2 grams of it. The visuals are nice and colourful with this one, but not overwhelming unless you take like 80mg. It enhances perception; increases awareness and I experienced synchronicity and interconnectivity of things. I remain fully functional on lowish doses, but there was one time my friend talked me down for 2 hours as the emotional analysis was hardcore and I had a headspace like lsd. It has brought me to tears a lot, and euphoria and bless as well. Hell of a drug, really under-rated I feel. 


2c-d is amazing as well. It is more stimulating, and the visuals are less colourful but more dynamic. Mild headspace for level of visuals but I had a really introspective and analytical trip on this one last night in which I systematically was going through and untying cognitive knots of aversion and especially attachment. I prefer 2c-d to cocaine any day; same goes for 2c-c over Mdma so I don't use those ones anymore. Maybe once in a blue moon.

Welp, I am officially done with my small supply of this molecule so I thought I'd share a few things about my experiences with it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I wrote a trip report about the first one, on 33 mg, so I won't go too much into it here. Shortly after that occurred I took a break from writing reports or posting in general though and simply enjoyed getting lost in my trips without taking notes and such for a while, and in that time I had three more trips: one on 40 mg, and two on 25 mg. My experiences were kind of all over the board it seems at least as far as 2C-C is concerned, which is part of the reason I want to share them here now in retrospect even though there's already plenty written on this one....


So, first as a brief recap, my 33 mg experience was highly pleasant and euphoric, extremely chill for a psychedelic, and filled with lots of beautiful and intense but still not overwhelming geometric visual effects in line with the Persian rug pattern style that is spoken of for these molecules, but nothing particularly hallucinogenic or intense in general beyond that. I guessed it felt maybe somewhat like mescaline did based on what I have heard of it though I cannot speak from experience, though some of the visual aspects did remind me in particular of synthetic tryptamines compared to the few other phenethylamines I have used so far. I was not particularly impressed compared to many other psychedelics but I did find it highly desirable in the sense that I would like to repeat the recreational experience at least.


I was thinking about experimenting a bit with my few other small phenethylamines stashes before returning to 2C-C, but I have to admit, there was something about it just calling me back, and I ended up taking my second trip on 40 mg shortly after the first. My hope was that it was basically just going to be like the 33 mg but a bit better, but it actually ended up being a fairly harsh experience without much reward.... The euphoria never appeared, I was still clearheaded but always felt tense rather than chill, the geometric visuals became more intense specifically just in a way that made them more annoying and hard to manage rather than more beautiful, some interesting 3D hallucinations were beginning to develop with eyes closed but I could never get comfortable enough to really bring them out much at all, and part of that was because there was also suddenly a strong body load that never developed for me on the 33 mg, but was broadly comparable to any other particularly physical psychedelic I've ever taken, same kind of physical stiffness and whatnot. I thought the closed eye visuals showed a little bit of potential but not enough compared to everything else going on, none of which was redeeming in the same way. I didn't lose faith in 2C-C entirely after this, but I must say, my enthusiasm for it was significantly dampened, and I no longer had any desire to try to push the dosage any higher, but rather to just accept working with what I could get from the lower dosages.


I went a while without tripping after that while focusing on other aspects of life, but finally decided I wanted to jump back in a bit, and I still couldn't shake that feeling that I wanted to explore 2C-C a bit more, even after that last setback, and even given that my supply of it was quickly dwindling while I still had those other phenethylamines to work with, so nonetheless, I ended up taking the 50 mg I had remaining that had been prepared for my highest dosage and splitting it into two 25 mg piles, and took the first one for this third trip with it. This time I didn't go into with many expectations since it was a lower amount than I had taken twice before, and as I would have imagined it did largely turn out to be similar to the 33 mg experience, and wholly positive as that was, but weaker in some ways, a very satisfying but generally mild experience. However, there was a part of the peak where I decided to do a balloon of eight chargers of nitrous oxide, and the experience was decidedly more hallucinogenic and therapeutic than even the most of my nitrous oxide experiences have been when combining with things like tryptamines instead.... I had been listening to music while inhaling and just thinking about the way my life had been going as of late, when suddenly I found myself amongst a crowd of shadow actors at a party where I came face to face with myself in the third person, and went through a complex inner dialogue of addressing various social insecurities and baggage from life I had been holding on to, resulting in a very meaningful and significant experience of finally letting go of some of those things. Following this release, I suddenly found myself as a point floating in a void inhabited by colossal statues lining the walls of ancient psychedelic temples extending far up into the sky and back into the horizon out of view, simultaneously representing myself and all of humanity and contributing to lessons related to acceptance of the basic self and the connectedness with others that still remains, and other similar things, until the release became great enough that there was nothing left in my perception but a feeling, and then that feeling began to fade as I returned to just the 2C-C trip. Afterwards the trip itself was not particularly notable, but I barely even payed attention because of how much I was thinking about what I had experienced, though I do think the 2C-C helped with that analysis as well.


In the aftermath of that experience I found myself in a place of extreme emotional vulnerability and contemplation of my entire life from novel perspectives, and it didn't take me long to rack up so many new thoughts and ideas and revelations that I felt my experience was in dire need of a part two, if you will, to reveal just how much of me had changed inside and what still remained in my way of fully integrating these amazing feelings of release and clarity. Because I was still in the same psychedelic mood that I had been all this time and because it was the only bit of my supply remaining anyway, I decided to take my last 25 mg of 2C-C and see how it hit me. As I was waiting for it and considering all the psychological tension I had built up lately just from having so many revelations without rest and feeling like I was on the verge of some big self-realizations, I suddenly felt it, just as I have plenty before on the base tryptamines: the purge. No nausea, just an immediate understanding that I was about to puke and all I had to do was let it out, so I did, and returned comfortably to where I had been sitting, suddenly feeling totally released of all of that tension that had been on my mind. As the trip began to set in more fully, this time the differences were hugely obvious.... At first I was overwhelmed with a buzzing bodily euphoria so intense to be nearly incapacitating, but entirely positive and pleasurable, and then I spontaneously began getting mind's eye visionary imagery that was vivid enough to be "seen" of erotic male entities of a kind I have seen before on DMT reaching out to me and touching and grabbing me intimately, sending rushes of euphoria through me when they did, while the room around us became increasingly covered in patterns and distortions highly similar in color and texture to the previous trips but larger, more three-dimensional, and more so beginning to form fantasy imagery as they pulled back away from me. I ended up doing another balloon of nitrous oxide because I was so euphoric, and that pushed me into an almost totally orgasmic state with lots of writhing and moaning while watching reality around me get ripped apart into salvia-like madness with beautiful female entities constantly spinning all around me and wrapping their arms in from the peripherals to get my attention though not quite breaking through, but after I opened my eyes again the top of the blanket I had on me suddenly transformed into nothing but a field of their hands still reaching out to me as they slipped back into the world of my subconscious. Afterwards I got up to go lie down in my bed and meditate, being followed by the erotic males now positioning themselves amongst the patterns and multiplying their forms to resemble Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man as I went, and put some more familiar music to accompany it. While lying there with my eyes closed my mind very easily carried me into the world of the music and projected flawlessly in lifelike detail the music videos I was familiar with into the space around me, moving me from one persona to the next and allowing me to live out the musical expression of the artist, and still allowing me to fully move my body and sing to the music without disrupting the stability of the hallucinogenic projection. The 2C-C peak does not last long for me however and shortly after I was satisfied by this meditation session most of the stronger effects began to fade significantly, but I still enjoyed the lingering versions of all of what I've described for at least another couple hours and felt absolutely amazing for the rest of the day, and beyond.


There's more to the story of what I was going through relative to these trips, but that's about it with regards to the actual 2C-C information. It's been a few weeks now since that last trip and the afterglow had definitely largely passed now other than the lasting positive impact the experience had on my mind, and I feel that I've had enough time to integrate a lot of it at least on a preliminary level, so I felt it was good time to share some of it. I'll also share just a few thoughts on 2C-C itself now that I am sadly through my small supply of it, though certainly not feeling that my experiences were in any way lacking all things considered....


For me, the main takeaway from my experiences with regards to the effects of 2C-C has been that it seems to operate on my biology in the exact same kind of way that DMT and other base tryptamines do, just in a somewhat hollowed out and smoother way that compares more to some of the bulkier synthetic indoles more so than the natural base. In fact, I would have to say that my last experience on it by far reminded the most of my 50 mg oral experience with MiPT, which also started with a purge without nausea, projected into extreme bodily euphoria and erotic entities, and then carried me into a dissociative experience of blending with music videos before leveling off into a blissful peace that lasted the rest of the day and following week. I also specifically recall feeling my first time on it that it reminded me quite a lot of EPT, which I had just used, particularly with respect to the more geometric visuals on top of the other general base tryptamine similarities as they were much more satisfyingly full-bodied and complex but also more modern or technological in a way comparable to LSD which EPT also is for me much more than MiPT. Likewise, that experience I had using nitrous oxide my third time with it only furthered these thoughts when it brought me to that out-of-body space with the ancient temple and giant statutes, it had an extremely breakthrough-esque feeling for me that was distinguishable from the majority of my psychedelic experiences aside from those that work in the DMT-like space. In general I would also have to say that I simply find the very calm and grounded feeling along with the specific types of healing, particularly including the purge, to be very much alike DMT and other base tryptamines overall, at least compared to the other types of tryptamines and lysergamides which I am more used to taking. And finally, even the fact that the trip's hallucinogenic nature became significantly more immersive for me as I experienced those various emotional releases and learned how to appreciate them reminded me very much of how DMT has operated for me in the past, with each push deeper into hyperspatial territory seeming to take me deeper than the last. Nonetheless, 2C-C does undoubtedly feel like a lighter psychedelic overall than the base tryptamines do for me, one that I would much more readily take for recreational psychedelia even if it's still going to be quite powerful objectively regardless, and it does have a few unique qualities compared to the base tryptamines that I very much enjoy and find more comparable to other phenethylamines and LSD instead, especially certain aspects of the analytical headspace and more playful and gentle but at the same time more widely present neon geometries, all of which add up to make it a quite fascinating and worthwhile and distinct enough substance at least for my own purposes, and I would gladly take it many times again in the future if given the opportunity.


Sadly, that is all of it that I had, so that is where my descriptions end for now... but I am certainly quite happy and grateful to have had the experiences with it I had already. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Hey Kaleida, glad to see you post, especially a trip report. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I also find that 2C-C puts me into an extremely introspective space where I have truly useful insights into my internal processes, I think literally every time I've done it except the first time a long time ago where I didn't quite get there or like it.  It lets me see myself in a very objective way, but presented warmly, non-threateningly.  I can also get into music very intensely on it.  Plus it's quite euphoric and the body feeling is really good.  Great stuff, I'm glad I got it while I had a chance.  I find it more similar to 2C-B than anything else, but sharper, more analytical and psychedelic, and the visuals are less colorful but crisper.  They're about the same potency to me, too, 2C-C is maybe slightly less potent.


I'll check out your TR. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm certainly going to try it at 50mg and 60mg.  I have no fear of this as it's extraordinarily comfortable.  I also want to try 2C-B at the same dosages, as I find 30mg of it to be quite underwhelming and 40mg to be starting to get good.

Is this orally?


I don't mean to derail to 2C-B, but a while back when I used to snort my 2C-B dose, I could go like 30mg in one very painful sniff, but since I swore that off I find it difficult to eat more than 20 or 25mg without just a ton of nausea on the comeup and puking everywhere, that makes me not want to go much higher. Because I do remember times on 30mg, where I'd be tripping pretty strongly, but I'd think "wow this is so transparent I feel like I could take twice this"

Hey Xorkoth, it's good to see you again too. :D Though, I should have specified that the trip report I was referring to was [this one](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/834588-(2C-C-33-mg)-First-Time-A-Gorgeous-and-Deeply-Satisfying-Experience?p=14186482&viewfull=1#post14186482) that I wrote back in November. The second trip was shortly after that and then the last two were just in this last month or so, so I took a pretty decent break there. Shortly before I had my first 2C-C trip I actually decided to stop focusing on taking notes and writing reports for a while too so that I could just go with the flow some more and enjoy getting lost in my trips more than I had been, since for so long I had focused on reporting on basically all of my trips, and on top of that my trips have honestly been pretty personal and interwoven as of late, such that I'm not sure I'd want to share much of them publicly yet and if I did I'm not sure each individual report would tell much of a full story anyway. Nonetheless, I did write the report for my first 2C-C experience since it was new to me, and I'll do the same when I move on to some other things soon, but I do intend to let myself trip largely without notes for a while still. In a few days I'll be taking ETH-LAD for the first time without that sort of focus so that should be enlightening. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, that describes my experiences with 2C-C perfectly as well, it's a wonderful tool for self-analysis and surprisingly psychedelic on the mind despite being so clearheaded and chill despite that. Music is also amazing on it, though quite different I would say from many indoles which for me are quite energetic, it often has me listening to much more mellow music like Bob Marley, hehe. When I took the 40 mg it was definitely too heavy on my body for my liking which was a little surprising, but after my last 25 mg experience I couldn't care less anyway.... Obviously I don't even need that much, I just needed to let myself open up to it more first. That's actually part of why ETH-LAD is my next goal too, I'm thinking that now after this I may start being able to get more out of lower dosages of other psychedelics that were previously too physically heavy for me too; I already took AL-LAD once at 150 ug since then and had a less intense but more impressive and satisfying experience than my first time on 300 ug with a far lighter body feeling, so things are looking good so far in that respect. I'm definitely extremely grateful for having had the chance to use 2C-C as well especially for this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's a great molecule in general, and I was certainly already headed for a lot of these thoughts and realizations anyway, but I do feel that all these 2C-C trips I had really did catalyze a lot of the emotional and psychological openings I've been through a lot more smoothly and effortlessly than a lot of other things would, so though my supply was small the impact it had on my life definitely was not, and I'll very much be looking forward to the next time I manage to get my hands on it now that I have really seen more of its true potential. Man, you really make me want to take 2C-B again now too, even if it is softer and less psychedelic.... A lot like 2C-C but even more recreational honestly sounds really nice to have around for just the right times. I do have to say, while we're on the note of comparisons, I am increasingly amazed how much my last trip on it really was like my 50 mg MiPT experience as well, particularly because I was really surprised at how much of a powerful hallucinogenic effect I was capable of getting off of just that 25 mg of 2C-C in the end, much more than I'm used to most others describing at such a point, and that seems to be how MiPT is turning out for others too, with those dosages around 50 mg being often more reported as less hallucinogenic and intense and more just mental and stimulatory and such for others. Maybe I really do have some kind of sensitivity to these particular sorts of psychedelic effects... which definitely makes me even more intrigued to use anything else anyone describes as even remotely similar!


Anyway, good to chat again, I hope things have been well on your end!

Unfortunately the one place I know of that was offering 2C-C has been on vacation for quite a long time now, and it's starting to look like they may not open back up. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  I'm glad I grabbed a decent amount while I could.

Yeah, I've been following that too, hope everything's alright. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) In multiple ways.... It is a shame about the 2C-C too because I really would have loved to get more myself, plus some other similar things.... Now I'm pretty much at a loss for all that. Ah well, I waited this long to get my hands on many things and I can definitely wait some more, I'm sure they'll come around again somehow.


Good to hear it, doing pretty well over here too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Life is busy but productive.... I'm actually starting to be a lot healthier right now and just started a weekly hiking routine too so I'm thinking about trying DOC again soon in that context too, hehe.

I got that from snorting 2C-I too, definitely done with that. I puked on this last 2C-C trip... but it was wonderful. Learn to love the puke? I guess it depends on how intense and forceful it is....

That's great about getting out and hiking more, as you know I'm a huge proponent of it, with or without being on psychedelics. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's finally getting to be Spring here and this weekend I'm going river hiking, and I've got months ahead of lots of nature.  I got my hands on some great mushrooms too, haven't done those in almost 10 years, so this summer is the time.  My girlfriend wants to take LSD with me soon, we did it last Spring, and she wants to make it a yearly thing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  She also wants to eat some mushrooms with me.  So I gotta say I'm happy about that, this is my first time having a partner who wants to take psychedelics with me.


But yeah, the 2Cs will come around again, somewhere.  They're way less popular than they used to be but they're classics and I think there will always be a demand.  I've heard that 2C-T-21 is going to be available soon, wonder if that'll happen?


It's odd, back in the day I got massive nausea from 2Cs but these days absolutely zero.

Yeah, I'm pretty pumped about it. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I didn't even really know there were too many good places around here for it but my old roommate found one recently and started the routine with his boyfriend and some other friends wanting to work out, so I'm getting into the habit of joining them for it. It's a little far for me but close enough that I can just drive to his place and then he drives us all there, which is also nice because it'll make tripping during it a bit easier to work out lol. It's definitely nice though either way, it's good to both be working out and just to be back in nature more often again in general.


Perfect timing! I'm definitely still jealous of that awesome path you get to hike. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Oh man, are you going to take mushrooms for the first time in a decade while hiking? That kind of seems like it could be more of an ordeal than something like DOC, haha. Should be great either way though, and I'll definitely be interested to hear what you think of them after so long and so many other trips! It's actually been a good minute since I took them now myself, and *tons* of other 4-substituted tryptamines.... It would be interesting to see just how they compare again now. That's awesome that your girlfriend wants to make tripping like that a regular thing too, that does sound great to have that kind of freedom and companionship in a relationship. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I don't know how I could be with someone who wasn't at least a little open to it honestly, they play so heavily into my desires, personal growth, and views on life.... You're certainly lucky in that respect!


Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 2Cs are set in stone in the psychedelic lore at this point, we may move further and further beyond them but they'll always be special for having played the sort of role they did and will always be recognized for their worthwhile and versatile effects. Is 2C-T-21 supposed to be specifically coming to the US market? I'm actually aware of a European vendor that has had it for a little while, but they don't ship here. They also have 2C-T itself, amazingly. [Ah, I was beat to it!]


I'm honestly kind of serious about the learning to love the puke lol. It's not the act of vomiting itself that is necessarily important, and I won't mind if that specifically diminishes for me like it did for you, but rather, my experiences have just been increasingly teaching me that if a psychedelic does cause me to purge, really all it likely means is that that molecule has a significant pharmacological overlap with DMT, and for me that's one of the most desirable qualities a psychedelic can have. From that perspective I see the purge as little more than cleansing, the same way it's often spoken of on ayahuasca, and that's really all it was for me from MiPT to 2C-C, each of which launched me into one of my most euphoric and visionary trips ever followed by incredible afterglows. So, maybe if you're not getting the nausea anymore, you're just all cleaned out already? That definitely seems like the goal. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't know, my stomach just seems stronger than it used to, nausea-wise.  Psychedelic come-ups are also easy for me now so I think that's why, there's not all this disorientation anymore.  The transitions feel smooth.


I'm probably not gonna take mushrooms for the first time again while hiking. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)  I may do it during a camping trip or something though, I definitely want to spend the whole trip in nature.    For the river hike this weekend it'll probably be DOC because my friend who I do that with and I have a tradition of taking DOC for it, it's just the best drug for the job honestly.  LSD is really good for it too but I prefer DOC for this sort of endeavor.  


My girl really enjoyed acid although she had a really intense come-up and come-down (but she handled herself very well).  I gave her 125ug of ALD-52 last year, and this year she wants to try half of that.  I also sometime want to introduce her to the idea of laying down and listening to music during a trip because she's never had a deep trip and I think it's the best way to get there.  We have eaten mushrooms together too before, like 2 years ago, and she's eaten them more times but never had a strong trip, and every time on the comedown and for like a day afterwards she feels incredibly sad.  Which I find strange, but she's also really interested in having a deep experience with mushrooms because of what I've told her about my first trip on them.  She really wants to have that breakthrough experience, or some sort of profound, healing, instructional experience, but she never has and I think she kinda thinks it can't happen for her or something.  I hope to be able to facilitate it happening. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Sometimes I fantastize about it happening and her reaction and the way she would be able to see things from a different, healthier perspective and open up to herself more emotionally, and it makes me tear up, I want for her to have the sort of life-changing shift in consciousness that I did. She's so nihilistic and cynical, but she desperately does not want to be. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

That's an interesting observation.... Come to think of it, while I have been getting less disoriented on psychedelics lately myself, the ones that were a bit heavier in that way in recent memory did have a little bit of nausea compared to the others. Though, something that seems significant about that now is that, again, my MiPT and 2C-C purge experiences actually had no nausea whatsoever, nor any disorientation. Both times, and a good number of other times I've had similar reactions from other psychedelics, it really wasn't anything more than the equivalent of a sneeze: I suddenly knew it was coming, went to the sink, did it, and it was done, with no discomfort at any point during the experience other than the grossness of getting it out, and afterwards felt amazing and clear compared to how I had before dosing. Though, now that I am thinking about it, I also recall that the second time I used MiPT, when smoking it, there was a little bit of disorientation *and* a bit of nausea, with no complete purge. In retrospect this is really just making me become even more convinced of the idea of it relating to some inner tensions now... though, to be fair, I increasingly think nearly everything I experience from psychedelics is related to this, so I may be biased. But what stands out to me is the fact that I observed that psychedelics, at least when I take the ones I like most and dose high enough, seem to put me in a state where I can no longer treat feelings of inner tension passively, and am forced to either actively release them or actively hold them back, the former leading to extremely positive feelings and the latter leading to extremely negative feelings, and when considering it from this perspective, it seems totally obvious to me that the purge is the positive form and the nausea is the negative form of the same kind of tension build-up. Perhaps the reason my purges are simply coming and going so readily is because nowadays I have learned not to resist that form of tension in any way, and thus the nausea often never even develops, it just comes bursting out of me and gets itself over with? And maybe, similarly to how I was theorizing with the DMT-like hallucinogenic effects, I'm simply sensitive to this type of psychedelic pharmacology in general, and thus I still am getting a high enough dosage to force a purge even if I wouldn't feel the nausea otherwise, but otherwise I might be similar to how you've also stopped feeling that nausea, which would correlate with how I also have stopped feeling so much of that disorientation. Hmmmm.... Interesting to consider, and just some food for thought.


Hehe, probably for the best. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) While camping sounds great though! Man, it's been even longer since I took them in that kind of setting myself, I definitely need to give that classic some of the attention it deserves again. Well I hope you have another awesome hike. :D DOC does sound like a better option for that from what I remember from your past stories too, though I could certainly see LSD also being awesome in that kind of setting. I'll probably run through my lysergamides while hiking myself before moving on to many other things just because they'll work better with the timeframes I'll be working with, plus I'm sure they'll just be awesome out in nature anyway. Have you tried AL-LAD while hiking? I know you at least took ETH-LAD outside... but I'd probably go for AL-LAD sooner in that kind of situation, seems a bit more forgiving and allowing in multiple ways at least based on how they've affected me so far. The lighter headspace than LSD seems like it would be a particularly big plus in such a situation.


Oh man, I can relate to that so much. For the longest time I was pretty much convinced that it was impossible for me to have that sort of completely profound and life-altering experience, on psychedelics or anything else, because it seemed like no matter what I took, no matter how often, and no matter what dosage, I would always only ever just approach the threshold of something big relative to what I was seeing apparently easily come to tons of people around me from something as simple as like a single street blotter or what have you, and I just really didn't get it. In retrospect, I really just had a lot more baggage I had to work through before I could even come close to having that kind of complete release that leads to such powerful experiences and it would take me many more years to fully comprehend that, but eventually I really started getting it and making more and more progress... though, totally honestly, that reaction you said you've fantasized for her of suddenly seeing things from a new perspective and opening up to herself more, I feel that only just finally fully happened for me a couple weeks ago, specifically from that post-2C-C AL-LAD trip I mentioned before, so I can *really* relate quite heavily. I considered writing a report about it, but even I have some things I don't feel the need to make too public... but profound, healing, and instructional are pretty good words for it; I even specifically "spoke" to my subconscious and ended up letting go of about fifteen years of psychological tension and dissociation because of it, and have noticed my imagination working in a very obviously and consistently different way ever since the trip, it had such a huge impact in a way that definitely is not going to just fade with time. So I definitely get that.... After that one experience I went overnight from being where she is to being where you are, I even went around telling my friends who have their own issues and insecurities who my instincts were now blaring at me seemed to be stuck in the same patterns of thought and behavior I used to be to tell them how much they NEED to have this kind of experience so that they can finally be free and happy, while flying high on a feeling of connectedness and understanding totally sober that rivaled all of my best drug highs. Pretty intense stuff....


It took me a long time to get here in part because I just had a lot to work through but also in part because I'm just hardheaded in the way that makes me want to figure things out for myself rather than relying on others and also just wasn't really lucky enough to know anyone in person who was too heavily into psychedelics in the way I am, but I'm sure your girlfriend will have no problem getting to that kind of experience much more readily with you to guide her. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's definitely just one step, but I do agree that lying down and listening to music while tripping is a great way to get that ball rolling.... Anything that gets me into a more meditative headspace and especially that simultaneously satisfies my senses really goes a long way to make my trips more powerful specifically in the ways that bring out my inner workings and shows me new things about myself or what does or doesn't need to be checked up on and such, all of which was key for me towards actually reaching that more fully opening experience. That is curious that she becomes sad after using mushrooms, but again, I think that's potentially a good sign as it just goes back to all that stuff about revealing inner tensions and conflicts and stuff.... No one said it was supposed to be all fun after all, or they didn't know what the hell they were talking about if they did!


Well, I hope that all goes well and smoothly anyhow. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I still haven't had any of that ALD-52 myself actually, I've really got to try some while it's around....

Wait until you try 2c-E Kaleida! Its one of the deepest most introspective psychedelics I've tried! I'd like some 2c-C though. Its been years since I've had some but I certainly have fond meomries. Its hard though when their all somewhat similarly priced yet some are way more potent. I loveeeee nature hikes on psychedelics. I've had some insane times smoking weed in the woods on high dose mescaline. Especially with some DMT, LSD, or 2c-E. Its interconnectedness is on a whole other level from most psychedelics.I remember just thinking about how some old trees were able to watch the landscape change around them for hundred of years sometimes. Pretty nuts.


Xorkoth, give her a simple tryptamines. Easiest way to have a nearly assured breakthrough IMO. MET IMO is like DMT lite. Pretty playful and friendly yet still strong. DPT could instill some "holiness" into her being as could 5-MeO-DMT. DMT could ramrod the beauty and serenity of life into her mind as well.![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) What you guys are talking about is one of my favorite parts of psychedelics. How sometimes even with a lower dose they can just blast you into a transcendent state out of nowhere. Always such a nice surprise as long as the setting is proper.

Oh I can't wait for that, 2C-E is definitely going to be my next phenethylamine. :D I'll probably do it as soon as I get a few lysergamide trips out of the way. It certainly sounds very powerful from everything I've heard.... Yeah, 2C-C is pretty great, and I'm happy to be able to get the effects I do from those lower dosages! I don't expect to see it again soon but I'll be glad when I do. It definitely got me *really* curious about the other phenethylamines though especially, thinking about what they'll be like if I'm already getting this much from 2C-C.... Pretty much everything I still have should be stronger than it in some way.


Man, I've really got to try mescaline, still haven't gotten around to that one.... It definitely sounds pretty magical. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'd love to go hiking on it too, it sounds like a great one for it from everything I've heard. I'll probably go through a number of these other phenethylamines and amphetamines before I get to it so that'll be some interesting perspective, but I definitely don't want to wait too much longer.... That experience of interconnectedness sounds great, that's definitely where I want to be right now. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) It's probably going to take me a while to get to the point of doing those combos out in nature though, haha.


Simple tryptamines are wonderful.... Recommended but powerful. Looking forward to returning to those myself. :D The only one I still have left to try is DPT.... And yeah, I'd have to agree about that being a favorite quality of psychedelics, it's pretty wonderful when everything lines up just right and literally anything can become a breakthrough experience, hallucinogenic, psychological, or otherwise. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I have to say, even with my limited experiences so far the 2Cs have a good track record with that for me.... I definitely had a few particularly divine-feeling or interactive experiences with 2C-I and recall even way back when feeling that it had some resemblance to DMT. Really can't wait to check out the others....

I know right! Its one of the reasons I haven't had any in so long, basically since the 2c's were dirt cheap. I can't help but want 2c-E more for that reason and it provides most of what C did for me in spades. I would like some again someday though. 2c-E provided almost as much psychogical healing as things like DMT or LSD. Plus its got that awesome phenethylamine time extension. I remember once in early trials I was sitting there and seriously had hundreds and hundreds of fully thought out ideas. I was suddenly like "Holy shit it must've been at least an hour or two!". Look at the clock and its barely been five minutes. Mind blown!


Oh yeah mescaline is the mother of phens IMO. Its so caring and nurturing. After I tried it I was like MDMA? Nah. MDXX are one of the things I used least probably for that very reason. Don't get me wrong though I loved 6-APDB though. It had this magical twelve hour tripping rolling vibe. It reminded me of mescaline, LSD, and MDA mixed up neatly. That was very healing too. Mescalines interconnectedness is on another level though. I not only felt connected to living things but even inanimate objects. Like I could feel the energy traces left on it by those things that had interacted with it. I've balled my eyes out on it with ecstatic joy about the connections all things have. 


Haha yeah I'm that guy that can act pretty normal on a lot of drugs. Still though on combos I just went places within walking distance in nature where I knew people wouldn't be normally. I had woods in my backyard which was super awesome. There was this city fair though once a year and I was tripping hard on LSD and mescaline. I went to the woods to smoke a big joint. Welp I forgot peoples tendency to go for their own little hikes in my woods then. I was sitting underneath this giant old oak tree, listening to tunes, petting my dog going deep when a guy walked in there with his young daughter. Super awkward and startling. I hid the joint so the little girl wouldn't see and the guy just laughed and walked her in the other direction. I never minded being in nature on psyches even with people around really. They never bothered me. I'd give a quick "Hello, gorgeous weather huh?" pleasantries and get back too it. 


Simple tryps are some of the best medicines around. The "holy" peaceful super aligning feeling they provide is astounding. Psychedelics, dissociatives IM with DPT or MET are some of the deepest states I've reached. DPT plus dissociatives is a well known, respected, and loved combo amongst pyschonauts.


I'd like to get some 2c-C for nature stuff though. Its lax introspective yet sometimes heavy or deep mindatatw paired well with it for sure. I'm glad to see this thread get some action again! Its been depressing since those kids in OK(?) snorted bic lighter sized lines of 2c-E and one died eventually leading to the scheduling of the them. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) I agree though phenethylamines are the class that most often blow my mind unexpectadely. Some if their dose response curves are wacky like 2c-D's which I think partially lends to that. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) my phens for sure! By the way Kaleida, I love seeing paychonauts report on their first encounters with phens its most always very interesting and I as always appreciate your deep multi faceted reporting of your experiences!![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Just sent this to my recent ex, hoping it motivates her to try something for herself. Pretty sure when we tripped together she mostly saw it as recreational. But yeah she could really use a good deep trip, she's been struggling a long time. 


If it pops up again I might grab some 2c-c, have only tried b, e, p, and t-7. The potency/price thing gets to me too, that's why I went for 2c-e and 2c-p first. 2c-p was a fuzzy, pukey disappointment and I still have most. All out of 2c-e though hehe so I'll want to stock up if that turns up ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) it's available in some places but mostly measured hits which I don't trust and are excessively priced

Yeah man, pretty sure my girl isn't going to want to try many other things... she wants to eat acid with me again, but she told me this morning she doesn't want to eat any of the mushrooms I got because it probably won't work out and it'll make her feel depressed afterwards.  She seems to not have any interest in DMT because I think maybe the idea just scares her, but I'm not sure that she'll ever go for it, and she definitely won't go for others because she's worried about the RC thing.  I told her maybe if she is able to break through it would be different, and she told me she doesn't think it's possible for it to happen with her.  I should show her Kaleida's post but she seems pretty determined to hold on to the idea that she won't be able to work through her stuff...


Anyway Kaleida I'm so happy that you feel like you've had a breakthrough, that's beautiful and amazing. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Well damn man. That's the thing though. Who wasn't apprehensive the first time with DMT? I was super excited but ground in fear of the unknown and utter respect. For instance I had one of my best friends be terrified of DMT for years. One night we were tripping in my backyard at night with a beautiful fire, a beautiful clear night sky with a full moon, and my beautiful dogs. We were on good doses of 4-HO-MET. I turned to him and asked if he was ready to blast off finally jokingly. He told me he was still scared but I just asked when weren't you scared to try most new things? He couldn't refute it. I blasted off with a large dose then gave him probably 40-50mgs to try to let him breakthrough. He did. At the end I got kinda worried because he started balling. I asked him if something was wrong, he replied "NO NO everything's just so fucking perfect!". He promptly got up and bear hugged me for a couple minutes uttering highly sincere sobbing thank yous saying that was exactly what he needed. I've seen that scenario play out multiple times. She's got a self defeating attitude. She seems sure she won't breakthrough. Remember set? That plays a hugely impactful role in trips. Guess what can smash anyone's mentality to pieces while their embraced by the most peaceful serenity ever? Simple tryps. That is the hideous cycle of depression and PTSD. I used to think I was a broken toy that couldn't be fixed. Guess what? I'm not fixed because nothings perfect but I'm far better than I ever was. If you can't find something to motivate her to break the chains that bind her, she'll lay there forever mistakenly assuming wallowingly that she never could. Sometimes life is not enough to motivate people. Plain psychedelics are much harder to use for assured breakthroughs. It usually just happens.


Moxious, sounds like you need some Ondanestron! I used to get terrible nausea from phenethylamines. Its way better now. I used to avert it too by plugging or IM'ing psychedelics. Many agree that this averts not only a ton of the tediously long come ups for some psyches, but it also dis a this to most of the side effects to. IM dosing quickly became my preferred method. Helps to when your a real combo who're because of quick onset with successive psychedelics added in secondarily. P.S. I love TPBs. Its been my favorite TV for 10 years now. I just so happened to catch the first movie on comedy central at 3 AM when I was tripping on 2c-E and had just blasted off. I saw the title time and was like "The fucks this?". After watching the opening scene I was in love forever after. 


Agreed too on the success Kaleida, was stoked to hear the levels you reached lately! Keep soaring higher!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I actually have ondansetron! I've used it a few times but I'm worried it's contributed to some sort of 5-ht3 sensitivity. I seem to puke more than I used to when I started but I'm not sure if it's a factor. Funny enough I plugged the 2c-p the only time I tried it, first thing in the morning because I knew it would last a long time. Led to dry heaving for hours lol not great. I don't find much body load with 2c-b or e which is cool. Don't think I'd ever be up for IM but it definitely seems more efficient at least lol. TPBs are the shit haha I'm so happy they started making new episodes again


I was apprehensive about trying dmt both times I've tried and they were both not particularly pleasant but not something to be scared of. I'm considering trying again when i get more, was thinking intranasal instead of smoked though

Hmm I never noticed this. I got so in the beginning of my foray into the phen family and more deeply exploring tryps. I have legitimate stomach issues in normal life. The more I tripped the easier it got. Then I started IM'ing(for the most part not always)and I haven't puked tripping in years. Its actually hard for me to remember the last time I have. Yeah I'm not suggesting you do but many people have an apprehension to IM'ing things. They think its hard or dirty or will hurt. If you use micron filters none of the above is true. Its so easy to IM in the lastus in the thigh. It only takes about a minute or two to prepare. Obviously there's a large increase to BA that doesn't hurt. I'm not a big fan of IV'ing stuff. The "rush" can be interesting but I like the "rush" from IM'ing better. It can also cut down the duration a bit which is useful for longer lasting ones. B and E both had a pleasurable BL IMO. Unless you convert it, snorting FB DMT is fucking rough and I've snorted many 2c's. For me DMT is only uncomfortable for about one or two minutes when that rocketing to the moon feeling comes on. Then its pure beauty, bliss, and serenity. Ahh man me too! Love swearnet too. I didn't IM 2c-C which would certainly increase its potency. Hmmm?!?

The main apprehension I have with IM is poking myself with needles and just the whole stigma that comes along with having those around. I know it's unfounded social pressure but nonetheless, I don't want to be making holes in my skin (that could scar?) or have needles around that someone could get the wrong idea about. It also seems like a short jump from IM to IV. Not to mention if there's a difference in onset time that can contribute to addictive potential. I'm pretty good at self-regulating but that's partly due to not taking certain risks I guess. 


I recently snorted DPT, which was unpleasantly caustic but worth it for the extended duration IMO. I was going to try plugging as well. I'm more comfortable with DPT because i have all sorts of psychological hangups with DMT and I can't handle them very well during a 5 minute trip. I also didn't get much in terms of mental effects when I smoked DMT but with snorted DPT there definitely were some, not sure if that would translate as well


Also wtf I had no idea about swearnet that's amazing. I was looking for a good source for seasons 7.5 & 8.5 there's not many seeds for them lol

I feel it and respect it. I do not live and die by the rush personally. I live and die by the drugs! ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) I knew this though. Will power is needed with drugs and ROA. Its the effects I'm after the only nice thing is a substantial increase in potency and lack of side effects. Plus time constraints at time. IM doesn't leave holes. I only use new needles every time. I don't play with IM. IV isn't my thing. You sacrifice a lot for it. To me its just not too interesting. IM doesn't really have a rush per say its just a quicker climb. Its like plugging just better. As long as you use sterile equipment you'll be fine but its all a personal thing. I started IM'ing for things like ketamine etc. Then it just moved on out of interest. Its not a requirement but I do like the lack of side effects and abating hours long come up. I've done it with other drugs that I know are pure but I don't use much other than cannabinoids, psychedelics, and dissociatives these days. They were always my favorite drugs. A few exotic sedatives still catch my fancy(GHB I love you very much!). Its the ease of it. Certain ones I always take orally though. Its just phens mainly or when I'm doing a secondary dose. If I've got a good time window I'll go oral unless its a pure dissociative or simple tryptamines that's pure. Some drugs just have different profiles when used like that. Its all about preference though. I understand I'm a bit of an odd duck though. I'm more interested in primary effects than some rush that lasts a minute. Yeah it feels good so do a lot of things. I'm not that big of a fan of MDMA it has a more hedonistic high IMO that just doesn't feel as real as mescaline or LSD. MDA and analogues are nice though sometimes. I used to be able to get really good MDMA that looked like beautiful opaque rock salt. You never really needed more than 120mgs except if you want a booster. It was cheap and easy to get from certain old sources. No real interest except as a novelty or a bit of an add on. I just hated having to waste DPT. Its such an astounding psychedelic. Plus IM you do enough you break through, no questions asked most times. I could easily snort 150mgs of good snow white DPT and would trip hard but I could IM 50 and trip harder for 4-6 hours. 80 or more lasts a solid six hours. DMT was nice IM too. IDK DMT was very healing for me orally and smoked. Its how I got to know it so it holds a special place in my heart too.


Hell yeah! I loveeee TPBs! I followed them even after the original run ended. I can't believe John Dunsworth died. In almost one month in was going to see them live. I hated that I missed seeing him perform, sucks.

Thanks for the thoughts and encouragement, guys. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) I appreciate it and am definitely very grateful to be feeling much better about my life at the moment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I hope it helps too, Moxious, or anyone else who wants to use that.... I can only hope anyone else who might be stuck in the same kind of situation I was might glean something from it.


Hehe, I'm pretty pumped to be able to get these good effects from such a small amount of 2C-C. Makes me a little worried for other things like 2C-E and 2C-P though lol.


Mescaline really sounds awesome, I can't wait to try it. I actually haven't taken MDMA in a long time either but I'd love something that can produce similar profound states of love and connection and such like that, I always heard mescaline was somewhat similar as far as psychedelics go. That's awesome about the woods in your backyard too, Help, and about the hiker, it's nice that he was cool about it, haha. I'm glad to report on my phenethylamine experiences as usual too and happy that you enjoy it, and thanks for the compliment. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm definitely very much enjoying exploring the world of phenethylamines now after being stuck with just indoles for so long, it's really neat to apply all the perspective I've gained to these molecules which are at once so similar and so different to everything I've used so far. Definitely looking forward to doing 2C-E next, I may do it in a couple weeks actually if I have the opportunity....


Ah, I'm really missing this one already. I really don't have anything that quite compares to how easy it was for me to take this and still have such a satisfying trip for what I want....

Kaleida you'll love mescaline, it's such a gem.  So subtle and so powerful, very empathogenic but in a centering, non-stimulant way.  Nothing else is quite like it. Hope you have a chance to find more 2C-C!  As for me, I have a little stash but it's not a whole lot anymore and I don't know how to get more...


And I *really* can't wait to get your take on 2C-E!

Make sure you start off pretty low on those ones. I was very pleasantly surprised with 2C-P at 4mg - nothing strong at all, but just the right dosage (for me) for such a long burner. I'm pretty much a lightweight. Most of the unpleasant 2C-P reports I've noticed were from higher doses, which has led me to believe this one is best kept pretty light.


Agreed with Xorkoth's sentiments about mescaline.

I'm kind of a lightweight too, specially with phens it would seem. 10 mg 2C-P is MAX I would take, feels akin to 16 mg 2C-E maybe. It's a magical thing though, one of my favorite substances for sure.


I had some 2C-C and DOC coming my way but stupid postal system sent it back to the return address ![:X](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/mad.gif)

You're pretty convincing about IM admin haha. I tend to be really conservative when it comes to dosing for fear of wasting material so there's a definite appeal in reducing costs. That's why I like plugging but it takes too much preparation. If I could prepare a shot in 2 min it would be better. Especially with rarities like what mxe I have left it would be worthwhile. Do you really IM GHB? I feel like that would be a lot of liquid but depends on the concentration I guess. Was your 120mg M dose IM as well? I usually take 125mg orally of white/clear rocks that are the purest I've come across. Does micron filtering remove all bacteria or just most? I wouldn't want to get any kind of infection just for efficiency's sake, and I'd be concerned about impurities too. Think I need to read a guide or something lol

That does sound pretty wonderful. ^-^ I'm definitely going to have to bite the lazy bullet and start looking into all the cacti stuff.... I'd love to be able to try it within the next year or so, seems like a good time in my life for it honestly.


Thanks much, I hope you manage to find some more 2C-C as well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It is a shame that it may be much harder to get now.... I do worry that it's only going to get harder and harder with it being increasingly banned and it being one of the lighter and less potent options, I'd definitely want a good amount to stock up on next chance I got.


And I'll definitely report back as soon as I try it! ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) I have an uncommon good opportunity to trip in a house with a backyard and all rather than my apartment in a couple weeks so I'm debating between things to do then.... I haven't totally decided yet but 2C-E is high on the list.

Wow, that is a pretty small amount. Out of curiosity, what constitutes "just right" for you in that case?

Good to know, thanks for the info and comparison. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'll have to keep that in mind when planning out my dosages with each, especially as I'm only going to get a few total with each with what I have.... 2C-E gets a lot of love but I have to say that I always thought 2C-P sounded particularly impressive as well, I definitely can't wait to try that one myself either.


That really sucks about the 2C-C and DOC. :/ Especially with the current goings on.... I hope you don't have to wait too long to find it again!


The postal system recently lost a package of methoxetamine that a friend sent to me.... I was not very happy about that either. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) There was 3-MeO-PCP too... but the feeling's not quite the same lol.

I've taken it twice at that dosage (actually it might have been 5mg the second time, but I forgot to note it), and it looked like this: lots of colour saturation, strong music enhancement, enhanced sociability, creative thoughts/fresh perspective, no patterning that I can recall, enhanced feelings of connectedness with surroundings and people, enhanced appreciation for beauty, a certain mellowness, warmth.


I was really surprised both times with how long it lasts. 18h later there was still noticeable colour saturation, but no problems sleeping (which is unusual for me with PDs) - I even napped during the middle of one of the trips. I wouldn't actually call it a real "trip" at that dose, and that's not what I was looking for in either case. It was more like a turn up and a chance to look at life from another angle. First time was for a music fest, second time was a day with my family, lots of walking around in nature on a day off, hanging out with my loved ones.


Yes I've taken 2C-E, I think 3 or 4 times at an above threshold dose. 8-14mg seems to be the sweet zone for me. 16mg felt a bit too much, but maybe would have been a good dose under different circumstances. I would like to test out the higher end of the dose range some more. I loved 2C-E very much. Feels the most detailed and unique of the alkylated 2C-x set. It's akin to acid, but in a phenethylamine kind of way, definitely a classic trip type of thing.


I'm a big fan of the 3 alkylated 2Cs. 2C-D I find is more similar to 2C-P than 2C-E, strangely enough, and I love it as well. It's cool for being a real short duration and just so simultaneously mild and enhancing.

It sounds like a bunch if steps but each one takes like ten or twenty seconds. Oh no of course not, I was just trying to elicit that GHB is one of the few sedatives I drool over! Yep. I loved MXE. I was dosing up to 250mgs orally for out if this world twelve or more hour experiences. Then once when I was 22 I was feeling very suicidal one night. It was about two in the morning. I was trying to watch parks and rec just to get some silly laughs. It wasn't really working and I didn't want to bother anyone calling them that late. I decided I would IM MXE. I had one IM rig and at that point didn't do it all to much. I loaded 80mgs. This night changed that. I IMd it. Was nervous. Within a few minutes I was crying so hard thinking how insane it was that I was thinking that way so seriously. It was like i was  standing behind myself patting myself on the back whispering "It's okay life is difficult, sometimes we all feel like this but you don't have too. Things will get better!". It was like the feeling was pouring directly from my soul and had always been there. It was quite insane. IM MXE is sublime. Same with O-PCE/DCK/K etc. They just gave a magical feel that way. I would start with maybe 40mgs maybe 60 if your feeling brave and want a strong experience. If you use a micron filter and sterile water, new gear everything(it's cheap online), finally use proper technique, the risk isn't zero but it's fairly minimal IMO. I've done it thousands of times over the last nine years probably. There's guides. If you want I could try to find a good one and PM it to you if you want. As long as you do it properly it's excellent you just have to know what your doing and do it properly which a child could do really. 


I'm looking at you kaleida and slowly chanting "2c-E, 2c-P, 2c-E, 2c-P!". Their my favorite 2c's for sure! I only like E more because it's a bit deeper IMO but I love Ps long wacky trip too!

Geez haha I usually take around 40mg MXE orally, can't imagine what that would be like IM. The one definite downside is that it seems like more of a pain to redose, orally it's easy enough to weigh out another dose but I guess you'd want to make extra syringes in advance for IM?


Awesome that you had a good trip to turn around those suicidal thoughts. I recently did some mxe + 3-meo-pcp that unbeknownst to me prepared me for a pretty shitty bombshell of bad news the next day. It's really amazingly useful stuff, I hope my stash gets me through the drought because I'm sure it will come back, even if I have to be the one to learn how to make it!


I'd be interested in IM K too, I usually snort a bit while on a psych and haven't taken occasion to hole yet, might prefer IM for that purpose. But yeah I could use some tips if you have the time.


2C-E was one of my favourites, one of the only chems I finished the bag on lol. Completely contrary to 2C-P, which I can't even give away because I have to tell my friends how horrible the trip was for me, 'but it probably won't happen to you!'

Haha yeah I loveee dissociatives. I started using MXE with friends. We'd start at 25mgs redose etc. Eventually I was like "Let's just eat 100mgs at once...". Bam beautiful hole. We fell in love. If you normally do 40mgs then try 20mgs IM. You can make extra syringes but that's mainly why I would do 120mgs at once. Nearly assured hole and no need to redose. I function well fucked up but it's still a task. I used to have this little chest that had all my stuff in it next to my coffee table next to the recliner though for the most part. Quick and easy. I'd just dose 2c-E, DPT, DOC(I had a sub mg scale don't do this unless you volumertrically measure!!), or whatever I wanted in the same syringe. Like being washed into the most beautiful ocean waves you could dream of. Put on the music right before. Have some MJ or synth noids ready. Get ready to sometimes become the music as I jourbeyed deep within the universe of my soul. 


Indeed. That's when I really fell in love with MXE. It healed my soul many times and brought me back from almost stumbling over the edge into darkness. You'd think. We all summermize why it hasn't but it's hard to understand truly. A few kilos of MXE could fetch a person quite a few stacks.


IM is best for K if youve been using dissociatives for any real length of time decently. The hole sucks you up so quickly and beautifully. DPT and MXE or K IM is so godly and otherworldly it's insane.


One thing I know for a fact, there's been times where some trips were completely side effect free and others where it's just laden with side effects. It's always worth it to give it a few shots before digging it's grave. Everyone I know loved P. Many even more than E. I think because it's a bit more playful and less stern then E can be at times.

I haven't tripped in awhile now and I have a lot of stuff I haven't ever tried, would 2C-C be a good choice to get my feet wet? What would be a good dose to just sit on the couch and get lost in music?

Sure would. It really depends how sensitive you are but 2c-C generally isn't overwhelming usually or anything. My favorite doses were between 40 and 60mgs. Nice and strong. Perfect for getting lost in some tunes!

I'd say 40mg is a great starting dose, but if you're anxious about it start at 30-35mg.

Bleh...  I would not recommend 2C-C unless you have nothing else at all.  I did it a number of times hoping to capture an experience like with 2C-B, but it was not to be.  I also did 2C-E numerous times, and I think of 2C-C as a somewhat lighter, shorter version of 2C-E.  Again, with 2C-E, I wanted something recreational like 2C-B, but it was not to be.  2C-E had more body load and steered me into a deep, soul-searching kind of trip.  2C-C felt a lot like 2C-E but without any real deep revelations, just kind of a waste of time.


The point is, 2C-C is not recreational, IMO, and it is not educational like, say, 2C-E, so I am not a fan.  I mean, I guess you could say it is pretty harmless, if you want some experience with psychedelic states that probably will not totally freak you out, I guess it might be something to try.

It sounds like it's pretty enjoyable for most from what I've read and the sedative aspect of it is alluring to me. The other ones I was considering are 2C-D and 2C-B-FLY but the dose required to produce an engaging experience seems more finicky with those. 2C-B is the only 2C-X I have tried and I do love it having used it a good number of times.


I was blessed enough to acquire some Mescaline HCl a few years back and I have never even removed it from the vacuum seal but I think that would be best suited for a special occasion. Most of the other stuff in my collection I have yet to try (2C-E, 2C-P, DOC, DOM, 1P-LSD, ALD-52, ETH-LAD, αMT, DPT) seems either too long or serious to start with.


I'm so excited to get back into psychedelics as I've used them very sporadically over the past couple years as I became preoccupied with dissociatives to the point of abuse. Over the past year I've cut my dissociative use back to a very small fraction of what it was, but I would like to reduce it even further if not to zero because it's just monotonous and contributes really nothing positive to my life at this point. I still long for that escape from reality every so often and psychedelics are seem like the only reliable and healthy path to that going forward. 


Anyways, to start I think I'm gonna go with 30-40mg of the 2C-C! I'll report back how it how it goes!

I tried this one for the first time a few weeks ago. As my first trial I wanted to star low, so dosed only 25 mg. My girlfriend was with me and took the same dose. Effects were slightly above threshold, but sill evident and unavoidable. A strong ++ I would say. It was perfect for a chill evening at home. We watched the Czech movie "Sedmikrasky" and then made love, listened to music smoke some weed. We were both in high spirits, headspace was gentle, transparent and very calm. I agree with the "sedative" nature this one is reported to have. We felt kinda couch-locked for most of the come-up. Still very awake, just not restless. Body feeling was very warm. Lots of sexual energy too. Visuals minimal, but present in the form of quite noticeable color saturation. Adding weed made faint patterning start to appear but never fully develop. Sleep was possible 4 hours latter. 


Overall quite excited to try it again at a higher dosage. Seems like this is a gem I somehow overlooked before!

Yeah, I hated it the one time I tried it at 20mg. Classic icky phenethylamine underdose. Twenty years later, I realize I should have just dosed higher, but I've never come across it again. Everybody just synths the more marketable and more potent 2C-B. *sigh*

I like 2C-C probably more than 2C-B because it's intensely but very lovingly introspective and useful in that way... I've had several profound realizations about myself that have stuck with me when I didn't even expect them.  Most recently that I need to quit drinking/GABAergics (have only drank once since and trying to get off phenibut again).  I actually get useful, euphoric and introspective trips with as little as 15mg of 2C-C.  However I feel like I've had to sort of work with it a number of times to understand it better before I could get more out of lower doses.  I haven't taken it above 35mg in a long time, at that level for me it is fully psychedelic and quite visual.

That's awesome. I love materials that can be worked with fruitfuly at lower intensities like that. I found the same to be true of 2C-B, which also necessitated a lot of work at higher doses to unpack its utility; even then I'm ambivalent towards it.

this stuff is amazing. taken it only twice and im pretty positive i like it more than 2c-b or 2c-d already. yesterday i took about 25mg over the course of 2 hrs on the tail end of some mxe, it was really euphoric - almost on the level of mdma but in a different way. music appreciation was outstanding, i think winters love by animal collective may be the best song ive ever heard. not very visual at this level.


today i plugged 30mg of mxe then about an hour later i plugged 20 more and ate 30mg of 2c-c. loaded up 5mg of 2c-c in an oral syringe and prepared to go on a hike. im hiking at the flatirons and i was trying to time the peak of the 2c-c when i got to the top and then if i needed a boost i would plug the rest when i got up there. ended up getting to a nice rock outcropping and sat down and ate some fruit and chocolate. then i plugged the 5mg which wasnt as difficult as i thought it might be up there. anyways it never got crazy visually but again it was euphoric, although not as much as yesterday. i felt incredibly open, this stuff is downright therapeutic. im gonna take a break for a couple weeks at least, but i cant wait to experiment more with this

I absolutely love 2C-C, to me it's like 2C-B except just better in every way.  Every time I take it I get into a really useful, lovingly introspective state of mind, and sometimes unexpectedly have pivotal moments where I realize things and make changes.  It's very euphoric and warm, visual too at higher dosages, both recreational and useful, just all-around good medicine.  I am almost out of it and I deeply regret not stocking up when I could. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


I guess I more or less just repeated myself, but I like to sing the praises of 2C-C. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No worries, I fiend the stuff I love it so much. Wish I still had some around, I want to try 2c-t-2 and 2c-t-7 but I don't think another 2c-x can compare. This one is phenomenal, clearheaded, investigative/curious, somehow still functional, wonderfully visual especially the pastel colours and morphing, and analytical. I feel that this one is the nootropic over 2c-d which felt kind of shroomy in a way to me at higher doses. Haven't done 2c-e. I've had awesome visuals on this too, closed eyes visuals similar but less vivid as dmt (entity contact, morphing faces communicating to me, fractals etc but that was on a lot and a binge of this stuff... I think I even saw a rotating colourful rose at one point in the great abyss and unknown). I'll never do it again but it has become a part of my destiny.

I've also only tried it twice but I already love it. My past experience with 2C-X were mostly 2C-E and 2C-P, a couple of underwhelming trials with 2C-D. This one's so different from those. I still haven't push it past 30 mg, but a 45 mg trial is in order, hopefully this weekend ![(:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So far it seems like a nice psychedelic to add to a disso. I bet K-Holing on it would be fantastic.

No, I am pretty sensitive to it and 30mg is strong for me... usually I'll take like 20mg (but I also usually want to take it and play or see music).  I think I'm probably unusually sensitive though.

When I took this with MXE there was literally no cognitive impairment the next day. Generally when I take a dissociative I feel noticeably slower for a few days after. 

Not to mention on that combo I was able to think really deeply. Was on a hike and just having ideas to pursue, writing them down in my phone. Here's a few of them.

-Worries draining cognitive processing power

-Evolution integrating NMDA antagonists Zinc and Magnesium

-Imagine being dropped into our world by yourself (on the condition that you dont starve). In this sense culture (along with our bodies) is the medium of morphic resonance.


Now maybe this stuff isn't all that profound, but it's always nice when you can have intellectual type fancies on a psychedelic. More than just the usual abstract sense of understanding that is impossible to articulate. Anyways I really think there is a nootropic side to 2C-C. Much more than I've noticed with 2C-D which seems more mentally blank.

hi, my friend who used to love 2c-c (stopped taking all psys after a bad trip with bk-2c-b) reported slight cognitive impairment on the day after and his doses were low


meanwhile I've taken huge doses of 2c-c and haven't noticed anything like that (other than if you take enough you'll still trip when you wake up :D )

I've been thinking about this too lately, and about other neurotic thought loops that are probably happening in the background, subsconciously, draining cognitive power. I have the sense that we're all riddled with mental worms churning away on useless shit in the background, and that meditation and psychedelics are ways to help bring these to stillness and untrain these circuits from locking onto wasted processing. Mental equivalent of hardrive defrag and uninstalling junk apps and malware.

50-100mg plugged 2CC sounds spot on to me - I tried 60mg and 65mg plugged and felt it wasn't enough; it's always on the edge. Just wasn't very sensitive to this stuff at all

I plugged about 100mg 2c-c and probably about 100mg mxe in 2/3 doses one night in 2011. The last dose was the impetus for spiritual connection/oneness and it was quite beautiful and helped me a lot with empathy.

Has anyone noticed noticeable tolerance buildup with 2C-C? I took 30mg after not having tripped in a few months, not very visual, but a really rewarding experience. Went for a hike and sat on a bench for like 30 min watching the birds and trees, seemed like all the trees were making faces or had their own personality. Then I took 35mg a few days later, drank a few beers and smoked some weed and painted with my gf, pretty good experience as well maybe a bit more visual, though the peak only lasted about an hour.


This last time I took 45mg after 8 days off and I was really thinking it would be a decently visual trip. But it wasn't as strong as either of the previous two even after some weed. I guess 3 times in 2 weeks is a little much. I may try plugging it, but I saw on some of the earlier pages of this thread that it makes it much more chaotic and confusing. I was wondering if anyone could comment whether plugging it significantly altered the qualitative aspect for them.

Yeah that's just normal for psychedelics, really.  I haven't noticed anything more than is typical for any other phenethylamine.


I have never plugged this one actually.

Alright. I know with 2C-B you could take it several days in a row without any real tolerance buildup. The only thing that discourages me is that plugging 2C-B/D there was a significant discomfort for like 5 minutes after, but then it completely passes. I think I might start around 20mg and titrate up if need be.

I dunno I have had a lot of 2C-B, in the past, and I noticed tolerance buildup the same as any other psychedelic.


Yeah 2C-B definitely burns quite a bit when plugging.  Best thing to do is dilute it extra, use a syringe that can hold 3 or 4mL of water and you'll get a solution that isn't very saturated and the burn is greatly reduced.

Took some 2C-C last night with a couple beers. Not even sure how much I took as I kept putting small amounts in my drink. Never had much visuals but it was really enjoyable. I think 2C-C reminds me of MDMA more than any other psych I've tried. Just such a smooth and uplifting euphoria. It left me in a really good place mentally, I've been doing a lot of things today I'd been putting off for some time now.

Completely agree i actually mentioned to a friend not long ago that i find it to be very empathogenic. It makes me so bubbly and loving and i just wanna take to everyone. I've taken 20mg doses and then gone to work and had such a good day and was happy to see even the people who are rude sometimes. The highest amount i ever take this one is 35mgs and that has me tripping really hard for about 4-5 hours and then i Glow for the rest of the day.


Love to take it with my girlfriend, it was the only Phenethylamine i gave her that she REALLY enjoyed. Im going yo be ultra conservative with what i have its such a precious drug to me. It's probably my 2nd favorite 2C being closely behind 2C-E for me. But nothing could ever really surpase that psychedelic, had some of the best moments of my life on it. But nowadays i love 2C-C for its easy nature on my body physically and a Euphoric high that i actually have found reinforcing. The first vial with 2C-C i had was eaten in a month.

So I finaly, finally have tasted some 2C-C at a good dosage, scale hopped back and forth between (37-38 mg's), really some great stuff. It's light on the mind and body, no stimulation whatsoever, maybe slight bruxism and nystagmus, but in the kinda way that it made you just want to close your eyes, sit back and relax. Come-up was so fast that I had to drop some etizolam in a glass, but did not end up taking it, just felt a little overwhelmed all of a sudden being almost at the peak instantly. Remained there for about 3 hours and then had a pretty gradual comedown over half an hour or so, not taking much longer than 4 hours total maybe.


I expected a much slower onset considering I put it in a gelcap and ate something beforehand, but after 30 mins I felt some surrealism kicking in, lights appeared brighter, 1-2 mins later and I was looking at everything breathing and shifting pretty intensely. It made everything appear very cartoonish, couldn't stop smiling, been a while since I've had oev's.


It's not as neutral as 2C-D, lot more empathogenic as already mentioned, even compared to 2C-I I think, but it's been a while since I took that one. I read [this trip report](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=25426) when I was coming up and I fully agree with that conclusion, apart from being overwhelmed a little though, lol.


> 2C-C was a very gentle and mild psychedelic for me. Even at fifty-milligrams I was never overwhelmed at any time. I was able to lead the trip in any direction I wanted to. In addition, it felt great on the body. No harsh stimulation, no body-load, no nothing to complain about. Although I would not call the material sedating, it was definitely relaxing. It certainly gave me no additional energy for my hike and I was exhausted by day’s end.

> 
> 
> I think 2C-C’s greatest asset is the fact that it is so malleable. It is the perfect material to give to someone new to the psychedelic experience or for the experienced user to take if one just wanted a gentle sparkle for the day. There is not the euphoria or sensory joys of 2C-B. There is not the depth of 2C-E. There is not the insight of 2C-I. Nor are there the extreme emotions and visions of 2C-T-7

I love 2C-C, and I'm glad you had a good experience.  I also find it very empathogenic, and quite rapid in the come-up (so is 2C-B).  I think about 2 hours in is the peak of the peak for me but at 30 minutes it starts to rocket up.  I almost always get good introspection, and euphoria, and although it's not as visual as 2C-B, it is quite visual.  It's most similar to 2C-B but still quite distinct.

Honestly I think I prefer this over 2C-B as well even though that is fantastic. But 2C-C is just so easy on the body and quite psychedelic indeed. Some of my favorite trips last year was on it and I still have a good bit but I love it so much I'm holding off on taking any. Only been using 2C-B frequently these days mainly because I know it will be easier to get more of it. Who knows if 2C-C will become available again like it just was but I'm grateful for the friends I have that helped me with that. It's one of my favorite Psychedelics most deff from the 2C-x series only just behind the behemoth which is 2C-E.

Yeah, I submitted some 2C-C to EcstasyData for analysis, because my friend experienced day feeling as well and I've never heard anyone else have that experience. That said, it's most likely my body/metabolism and not any impurity. 


2C-D often gives me a bad headache on comedown, too, or sometimes the next day. Somehow that feels more familiar and less concerning, but it's still awful

Interesting. I haven't gotten that from 2C-C/D but I get it with 2C-B. I won't even take it anymore because the headache on the comedown is so excruciating.

I can't compare it to 2C-B, haven't tried it, but I definitely prefer it over 2C-D and 2C-I already. The duration and just the whole experience is great imo, biggest drawback for me is the dosage. I see myself doing this more often than I would like to admit, so I don't know how long this half a gram would last me. Not forever like a lot of other stuff, that's for sure. 


Oh and this somehow reminded me of mescaline, without ever having tried it. But I kinda feel like the bodyhigh and imagery is going to be similar, but more intense and "spiritual", or something.

Took 49mg today and my impression was that 2C-C is first and foremost a somatic psychedelic—bodily sensations are quite malleable on it. The pleasurable body high combined with the emotional component (generally positive) evokes comparisons to MDMA, although there isn't much empathy to speak of. In fact it seems self-centered, aiming an "invisible hand" attitude towards one's social surroundings, whereby the best way to take care of your fellow human is by taking care of yourself. Social anxiety is reduced as well.


Working memory and cognition are unimpaired, and I can think almost normally on it. This is atypical for me with psychedelics, and I suspect 2C-C might be the real smart-drug candidate as opposed to 2C-D. 2C-C leaves the ego almost entirely intact, and I think 25-30mg 2C-B is more threatening to the ego than 50mg 2C-C. I also think 50mg 2C-C is less visual than 25mg of 2C-B. There's basically no form-constant development whatsoever.


I spent the first hour today walking my dog and had a chest tightness that made me want to go inside. I pushed onward and about 30 minutes in it completely abated, and my body began to feel much more transparent. It also seemed that I became much stronger, as if the actin and myosin cross-bridge coupling in my arms had suddenly optimized its tensile strength. I noticed this when it became almost effortless to restrain my dog's lurches, which normally exhaust me.


Another thing I noticed was that my attitude towards my environment completely shifted. The past few months I've really struggled to adapt to the constant grey skies and rain of the PNW, but the 2C-C helped me stop focusing on those things and just focus on the natural beauty all around me. Walking in the rain without a hat would normally bother me, but today it didn't seem like a big deal. I'd also had a negative attitude towards my parents lately and feeling little urge to contact them. On the come-up I realized how much latent dissonance this attitude was causing me, and that for myself more than anything I should reach out to them more often. I resolved to reach out after the trip, but my dad ended up calling me on the comedown and we had a great conversation.


Duration wise it tapered down around four hours in, but music appreciation lasted an hour beyond that with good body energy even at eight hours in. Bit of a dehydration headache on the comedown, but none of the terrible comedown migraines that made me stop taking 2C-B. Bittersweet that I only have one, maybe two doses left. I think next time it I'll try to focus on the somatic element and maybe I'll make some progress with my muscle spasticity. On its own I've now tried it at 49, 45, 35, and 30mg, along with some lower doses and in combinations, so I think next time I'll explore a slightly higher dose. I did take 400mg of phenibut this morning, and I think I'd use an even lower dose next time.

Hi people


I ordered some tablets with 30mg 2C-C,

never tried the 2c-x series... so well, who knows what I can compare it with, but probably mescaline, as I've taken san pedro resin once (I did it myself so it was quite fulfilling despite of the horrible, horrible taste...)

I probably gonna have it in a few weeks, let's see what happens, I like the idea of it being for "all publics" since I would like to introduce my mother to psychedelics at least once in life.. it's going to be difficult but surely she will enjoy it, she's quite conservative but she has an open heart, she wrote books for children and she knows to paint pretty well, I think it's a hippie but repressed in some way, maybe the psychedelic would help her? I guess so...

I actually tried 30mg last week at the theatre when visiting Avatar in IMAX 3D. I was on Pandora for hours. I cried my heart out and was amazed at the same time. This is so gentle stuff, the perfect introductory psychedelic. At the same time, when you know your way around your mind a bit, this can be as deep as anything else. 


What a substance, thanks Shulgin, love it ! ![♥️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2665.png)


Ps: went for a marvellous dinner afterwards. I was so hungry ![😂](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f602.png). Slept for 6hours and had to go to work. Marvellous mood throughout the next days.

Yeah 2C-C is lovely stuff, I almost always have a very useful, warm, but deep and useful introspection.  It's very emotional and can be confronting even, but in a gentle, loving way.  It's also great for recreational purposes.  Quite a bit gentler than 2C-B even.  less visual, but rather similar.  However I find 2C-C's emotional/introspective thing to be much more directed and useful than 2C-B's mental state.  I also find it just around the same potency as 2C-B, maybe just slightly less potent.  Old reports mostly seem to suggest it's worthless below 50-60mg, but I disagree.  In fact I have never taken it that high, I think my max was 45mg once and I was tripping hard.

I mean, some people are sensitive. I’ve seen 40mg completely obliterate my heavy set buddy while I still don’t trip too hard at 50mg. IME anything below 50mg is a waste of material. I’ve tried several lower doses in several settings (both social and alone) and it never really got off the ground.


I really don’t know why I’m so insensitive to it. It’s annoying, it makes the roughly 1.5G I have left certain to run out faster.

Yeah that's a bummer.  Seems to align with my perception of it from the old reports.  Fortunately for me, 30mg is a solid trip, I even like 10mg and 20mg.  10mg id a light day enhancer, 20mg will get me thinking and tripping at a low level.  30mg has me seeing visuals everywhere and tripping pretty hard.  40mg is like... I'm gonna be tripping balls.  I don't think I've ever taken 50mg.  No wait, I have.  back in my early days of first finding RCs, I took 50mg my first time and found it underwhelming.  I seem to have become more and more sensitive to psychedelics as I get older.

That's an interesting phenomenon you always report on. I only hope I have your good fortunes in regards to that ![:rolleyes:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f644.png)


I think I've maxed out 2C-C at ~65mg and even then I wasn't like 'woah, toooo much', I just remember thinking that my head hurt and a lot and things were finally getting near to 'too much', but not past. Visuals were finally where I wanted them but that was definitely a high dose. And what's weird, with 2C-C I have no fear of pushing the dose, or even with acid I'll eat 3+ tabs and be like it's whatevs. But not tryptamines, I keep using lower and lower doses for mushrooms, psilacetin and such.


I hope next time I break out the 2C-C that 50mg floors me. At this point it's such a gem to me it's hard to justify use ![:confused:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f615.png)

No way 50mg does that man ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) if you have some 2C-D to combine with you'll feel the 2C-C in there at a much lower dose.

Or finally break out that 2C-B ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I dunno, if he has what happened to me happen to him, 50mg might just floor him one day.  Given I didn't used to find 50mg all that interesting, but now I don't ever reach for more than 30mg.  Maybe I'm just lucky though, I'm not sure it's typical for sensitivity to psychedelics to go down with age.  It started happening to me in my mid-30s.

Yeah,


I have now a similar opinion/experience to yours,

I barely have experience with it, just one dose, of a pill that supposedly has/had 30mg..


I kinda like it, but the set/setting was honestly very deficient. I just had the typical psychedelic "craving" that one has when you have a new compound and you have been pretty busy, and then you're not... and even if you have something urgent to do, it's not urgent enough not to take the substance, I don't know if you can picture those moments..

I knew that the moment was not perfect, because I was going to travel next day, quite early, and the travel arrangements like the baggage was not completed.


But.. I thought that I could do it calmly even when on the substance, it happen that way, but it "killed" the substance character in a way.


I felt that 2C-C it's very "malleable", because I could feel sober and without visuals if I liked, and only during 30-40 minutes during the peak it was difficult for me to form thoughts or phrases/conversations exactly the same as sober.

I never tried any other psychedelic that does not change the mindset/thought form as little as 2C-C.


As you said, the main characteristic is the emotional openness that resembles MDMA or 6-APB, but in a psychedelic way, not very different than mescaline, the other only phenetylamine that I tried (well, calamus has phenethylamines too, but...).


I thought that I was almost sober, after 2 hours and a half and I started feeling pretty dissapointed as the visuals only lasted 20-30 minutes, during the end of the come-up phase that was pretty odd. I was wrong because I suddenly felt super sad, but not in a bad way, I was just confronting my grandfather death, that was like a father for me, as I was raised by him, instead of my real father (that flew by when I was very young). It was very very emotional and dramatic, because I felt that I was not really open emotionally talking, during the last period of my life, probably because I used kratom, and I realized it was because living with a BPD partner it's just too much for me, for my emotional stability, but that has also affected my emotional openness, needed to address certain very important events, like my grandfather death, that happent +3 years and a lot of other things...


I was alone for some days in my grandparents home, and it happen there, obviously the setting was crucial in that point but I guess it's something about the substance, that creates some body high and mental serenity/peace, that allows the difficult emotional shit to arise to the surface, which seems SUPER therapeutic, as other BL'er has said, I agree a lot on that.

It seems to me very therapeutic and I see that it can be quite deep in larger doses. I don't know if the pills were underdosed or what, maybe they are not, but I think I would enjoy more 40-50 mgs to have a broader, more complete trip.

For that same reason I DON'T think that it's the better substance as a introductory/first time psychedelic, because there's a lot of people with emotional traumas and shit like that that could go mad if suddenly confronted with it, even if the very nature of the substance is gentle and compassionate... I think low dose (10-15mg) of 4-ho-met would be better for a lot of people, and perhaps for others this substance would work perfectly, not for everyone.


The visuals were elusive and very short-lived but they were marvelous and like nothing I've seen before, covering all my visual field, very natural (in terms of credibility) and very intrincate, complex fast changing nets like arabesques and metallic/"sci-fi inspired" in feeling.


The body high was very interesting, warm and all-encompassing, with some kind of opiate like (but more "shield-like" and not "blanket-like") feeling. 

At the beginning it was VERY sexual, with some curious sensation that started in the chest and quickly goes down to your genital area, like "waking up" your sexual urges, making you very aware of your "power" and inviting you. Strangely enough I didn't masturbate nor wanted to do anything sexual, like when I do NEP or yohimbe, but I feel that if I were with a woman, then I would have liked to do it...


Well, finally this comment seems more like a trip report, but I let it here, I guess. The trip was pretty short (maybe because of using low dose 3-FEA only 2 days before), around 3 hours n something. I would like to use it again, as I said with larger doses.

Had another experience with 2c-c


this time was pretty different since the setting was totally different: a nasty rave in New Year's night (so, yesterday) in a gigantic abandoned building...


I also took it quite close to the dinner (that was quite light, to be honest) and along some wine and later some beer, just to get the throat not as dry...


It was pretty amazing, the dose was 45, along the night, but the redose was very late, so I barely feel it, it brought the magic back for some time, but not really visuals or anything.


The visuals consisted in tracers and some patterns, but the context was not inviting me very much to focus on that, more like going round from place to place, talk with a friend and dance dance dance...


I noticed that it's a pretty versatile compound, because you could be chatty, or practicing active listening, without getting nervous or impatient (difficult for us, adhd'ers). It didn't have that emotional releasing energy, until more or less the end of the trip. It was pretty stimulating, not sedating at all, maybe the mix with the alcohol and setting did that? not sure.


I met very beautiful girls, but the substance was not inviting me to talk or engage with them, I was more focused on having fun with my body dancing, I think some girls realized that and then they got closer, several times (I'm pretty sure they like people who dance unrestrainedly). I barely felt the sexual energy I felt when I was alone in my grandparents home, I guess it's because I was more tense, in a way, due to not knowing almost anyone there, and being a "seemingly" intimate group of people, in which everyone has known each other for a long time. My friend was going here and there and I, instead of following him, was walking around looking at the sky, watching the people or dancing.  I was in and out of the dance rooms, as I was dancing at 200% and couldn't hold the beat for more than 30 minutes, sweating.


Finally I took a couple to their house, in a nearby town, by car. They hinted the petition as they saw me approaching my car, I felt a little sorry for them and gave them a ride.

There I realized that the sun was going to start to rise, and I went home, still with the 2c-c redose active in my body. I noticed that I kept talking and got very good feedback from the couple, I think I was especially honest and natural, even kind of funny (I'm not very funny).


I had a great time!

I was reading through this thread last night at bedtime because I recently got me some 2cc, and I dreamt that I took it and had a wonderful trip. Lots of closed eye visuals, very erotic… I hope my dreams come true!

Most relaxing and dreamy 2c I tried. Really good stuff!!! And has a lot more similarity to DOC than 2c-i has to DOI but that might be just my subjective experience.

Yeah, id say the 2C-C is up there with my favorite psychedelics. Deff one of the stand out compounds from the 2C-x series. It almost feels like an empathogen to me and the euphoria it gives me rivals MDMA. And it doesnt have the harsh comedown i get from that so id pick 2C-C over that any day.


 Like Xorky i can get pretty heavy trips out of 30mgs so that is my common dose. Ive gone higher at times but only when i was tripping frequently. The only drawback for me is the short duration, it comes and goes so fast its wild like all done is 4hrs or less. But i suppose that could be a good thing if you have stuff to do in the morning.

So 30mg is a good starter? I got pills unfortunately so I can’t know if they are 30mg as advertised. They are the typical ones sold on clear sites right now in a certain Germanic country, if anyone has tried those… I dont want to deal with an underdose because I only have two 30mg pills. If I like it I’ll get more.  Redrop is possible in the first 1.5 hours like most psychedelics, in case it’s too weak?

Yeah. 30mg orally is really nice. I did quite a bit more than that and it still stays pleasant and with minimal or no body load.


I never pushed it as much as some of my friends but it’s a really forgiving substance. Friend who took 60mg said it was like an uber lethargic but really nice.


Did you tried 2c-b? If you did I would start with a same dose you like with 2c-b. I think you could say it’s about or even more potent by mg but also even more forgiving and with less body load, completely different experience otherwise tho.

It was very very emotional and dramatic, because I felt that I was not really open emotionally talking, during the last period of my life, probably because I used kratom, and I realized it was because living with a BPD partner it's just too much for me, for my emotional stability, but that has also affected my emotional openness, needed to address certain very important events, like my grandfather death, that happent +3 years and a lot of other things...

I must admit, if I were asked today what would be a good 1st time psychedelic experience, I would actually choose 150ug of AL-LAD.

Now most people would be horrified at suggesting a lysergamide as a first experience, but AL-LAD has the psychedelia of LSD, but unlike it's big brother, it doesn't push your face into it and ram it down your throat (that's what can make LSD terrifying - it just steamroller you with psychedelia.

AL-LAD has no gastric distress, no "fuck I took too much" or any of LSD's ordeal by psychedelia properties. The only aspect that was weird, was the overwhelming OEVs, from 300ug of AL-LAD. If I'd eaten 300ug of LSD, there would have been at least one moment of "fuck, too much", but it was good natured and had virtually no bodyload (other than the aforementioned vision fucked with OEVs). I chose it, as it was the first trip after my wife's death, and I felt cautious about how I would react. In fact AL-LAD felt more like an MDA experience, than a full on psychedelic. More than happy to repeat the experience (which I think will happen, as at the end of the month, there is a festival happening about a dozen miles away, with artists like the Levellers and Hawkwind playing (and Bill Bailey, on the acoustic stage. That means I will take spare underwear and jeans etc, as the one big thing about AL-LAD, is that it really is the stuff of uncontrollable laughing fits. I thought I was going to give myself a hernia, I laughed so much, in between quiet contemplation of my late wife).


Sorry to hijack the 2C-C thread, just when the subject of best drug for first psychedelic experience, I had to put my twopennethworth in!

No never had 2c b unfortunately. My phenylthylamine experience is minimal (once 2ci and one lackluster 2ce underdose). I will Start at 30 and if it seems light at an hour I’ll had 15 perhaps.

Took 30mg, it started off nice at an hour in, added 15mg,  then figured I might as well finish the last 15mg.  So 60 in all over 1:30 minutes. After the initial euphoria, waves of tingles and creepy crawly vision it just sort of petered out into nothing interesting. I was amazed that my capacities to play piano weren’t too technically diminished.  Nothing I did felt good or fun. Just off. Oh well, I’m glad I bought so little! Definitely not gonna try the 2C-D I bought any time soon.

Did you experienced strong visuals at that dose? Way you took it in 3 doses probably didn’t change whole experience that much (except come up) than if you took it all at once and you should have experienced quite intense visuals.


When I did 2c-c my experience was quite oposite, not that doing all felt great but more that even doing nothing and just listening to music was great. I also really, really enjoyed sex on it.


Well what to say but – different stroke for different folks.


I wonder if you would find DOC similarly disappointing as they do share some flavour no matter how vastly different they are when considering everything. If you like mescaline I’m sure you would enjoy TMA-2 a lot more as it approaches mescaline in a different angle than 2c-c and 2c-b do. TMA-2 is less “candy” than 2c-b and less relaxing (not in a bad way) than 2c-c. I liked sex on TMA-2 as much as on 2c-b but it’s a totally different experience, sex on 2c-b is like a most euphoric, sexy cartoon while on TMA-2 it’s more of serious psychedelic love making but not nearly as deep, demanding and mindfucking as it can be on LSD for example.


O yeah, and if you like K, most 2c’s complement it really really well or vice versa depending how you decide to dose combo.


And last thing, man you really should have done 2c-c and 2c-d combo, what Shulgin called “psychedelic tofu”, supposedly that combo is a lot more than sum of it’s parts.

No tolerance going in. 


The visuals were very mild, I had to focus on them. I would have taken it with 2C-D because I read it was good, but I wanted to see how it was alone first, in case it was really intense (some report high sensitivity). But then I gobbled all I had, so my remaining tofu is now just plain old tofu. I considered adding some 2fdck at the end of the trip to continue, but held off.  Still haven’t mixed dissos with psychedelics.


I have never had mescaline, or any PEA other than 2CE, I and now C. Unfortunately the only other one I see myself getting ahold of is 2cb and mescaline because the others it seems you need to know a chemist to get them these days. I spent a couple decades taking acid and shrooms, completely unaware that all these wonderful drugs existed, so I missed out on a lot of them while they were on the gray market.  So now I can easily get any number of exotic tryptamines (European market is pretty banging for that) but almost no PEAs.

Honestly they are not very similar at all. 2c-c last noticeably longer 8hrs?, has a bit of a spacey floaty feel and I could almost say the same thing about visuals, I find they are a bit blurry and dreamy. The most intense visuals i ever got from it, colors were floating and spilling out of my tv and drifting across my room like smoke. That was actually a little alarming. But I typically dont get much fractal patterning, Most of my trips with it have been positive, but I've also had a few where I felt off and asked myself why did i do this. Also, while i do find it empathogenic, i dont find it necessarily euphoric. Generally it doesn't really enhance communication though I might communicate w more emotion.


2C-D on the other hand much shorter (4hrs), definitely has a minor but very clear stimulation. Vibe is much sharper and again so are the visuals., at 50mg at least all color is hyper saturated broaching neon, and I get minor geometric patterning. It's also great for socializing and communicating is clear and easy. It does have a minor euphoric component, but probably less in the empathogens realm. Out of every phenethylamine I've tried, it has the clearest headspace.


Out of the 2, I would personally probably pick 2C-D much more often. It's much more versatile and imo forgiving.


My one negative experience with D was snorting 25mg at the Grand Canyon. Instead of increasing my awe and beauty, it just made me feel like I was an infinitesimal little meaningless speck in the grand scheme of things.


Also despite what shulgin says about it being tofu, I find it a proper psychedelic of it's own, at higher dose. If I had any more, I would probably take it by itself at 100mg. I've never combined it with anything, but I I def see it going great with 2cb, or MDxx

I think I read you're in EU, which IME 2C-B has always been more plentiful and popular than in the US. It is very slowly becoming more and more accepted here.

Yeah I classify 2cc and D together in my mind just as less cheered 2cx’s.  Anyways I probably won’t take 2cc again because after that experience I’d rather not risk wasting an evening just to see if I like it at a different dose, especially given I have a shit ton of other molecules I tried and do like and new ones that I want to try. 


On the dark net 2cb and mescaline are all over in Europe. Problem is I don’t know how to order from the dark net, so I just look at the ads occasionally and drool. One day I’ll meet someone with some 2cb. Also I have a couple pills at a friends in another country, so maybe I’ll try them next time I’m there. Oh and I forgot, I have 500mg of MAL in my stash. Haven’t tried that yet either!

yeah, that's exactly my problem..

I'm also in Europe and I remember well 4-5 years ago when it was ridiculously easy to get most of the "letters" of the 2c-x series, now it's almost impossible and I can only find -c -d and perhaps -e....

I never tried 2c-b and in my country you may get something but only if you find PROPER OldSchool psychonauts or those people who know how to operate in the DN, something that I prefer not to do atm. 

Honestly tryptamines are cool, I still need to try most of them, probably are my favourite psychedelics, but they are also the most serious of them all, so that makes it less versatile in most cases... the opposite happens with phenethylamines.

Fuck me i wish I knew about the clearnet back then. I was asking strangers in concerts if they knew anyone with drugs and buying in sketchy situations from complete strangers, who in turn were probably buying off the dark web. Lots of stress, a night in jail even from getting caught buying ketamine (which was actually coke apparently). I remember wondering for over a decade why it was so hard to find psychedelics in Europe (compared to the US, where I always knew someone with drugs). A fucking idiot I was!  All that beauty was a click away!!  But they won’t pull one over on me now. I got a big enough stash to survive several future bans and a nuclear holocaust.

Because if there is one thing PD posters like more than taking psychedelics, it is talking about them, here is my opinion on 2C-C:


I've tried it a couple times in the range of ca. 30  - 55 mg. I don't see much value in pushing the dosage further, and I think 35 mg is entirely adequate for that one. While it is often described as more calming, I didn't find much difference in stimulation between 2C-C and 2C-B. I have to say that 2C-B is not really all that activating for me though, it is both worthwhile to lie down and to dance or hike on it, the same is true for 2C-C. I really like the visuals 2C-C gives. It is a nice wish-wash blending of edges, sort of like an aurora or watching sand flow over dunes. However, it seemed a bit lacking in depth. For me it lacks the soul-touching properties of 2C-B. Of course it could just be that I'm missing something, I haven't taken any 2C-B lately and maybe I would be unable to reach these sought after spaces with that one either. I do find it very practical that the doses are bit higher. I don't trust my scale at home to measure doses of 2C-B without volumetric dosing. But I do trust it with 2C-C. Certainly 2C-C is a nice toy, but I'm not sure if it is a tool for me.
