**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**4-HO-MPT**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
4-HO-MPT is uncontrolled in the United States. It could conceivably be covered under the [U.S. Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/law_fed_analog_act) depending on how it's sold, but there have been no cases brought to trial that we are aware of. (Aug 20 2012)
 
U.S. STATE LAW #
 
Minnesota #
 
Effective August 1, 2012, Minnesota passed a law adding additional research chemicals to Schedule I. The banned compounds include 4-HO-MPT. See [http://wdoc.house.leg.state.mn.us/leg/LS87/HF2508.0.pdf](http://wdoc.house.leg.state.mn.us/leg/LS87/HF2508.0.pdf) . (thanks DW) (last updated Aug 20 2012)

*TiHKAL Entry #23*


## SYNTHESIS
To 8 mL of a stirred solution of LAH (1 M in THF under N2), there was added dropwise a solution of 0.48 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N-methyl-N-propylglyoxylamide in 8 mL anhydrous THF. When the addition was complete, the reaction mixture was brought to a reflux for 15 min. After cooling to 40 Â°C, sufficient water was added to decompose both the reaction complex and the excess hydride. After filtration through Celite (under an N2 atmosphere), the solvent was removed under vacuum, and the oily residue dissolved in MeOH, neutralized with HCl, and Et2O added until crystallization started. Thus there was obtained 0.23 g (54% of theory) 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-propylindole hydrochloride (4-HO-MPT) with a mp 162â163 Â°C. Anal: C,H,N.

## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
How far can this argument be pushed? What about one of the N-alkyl groups having four carbons? Keeping the other N-alkyl group as the smallest and most simple methyl group, all four isomeric compounds are known. There is the n-butyl isomer (4-HO-MBT, an oil), the isobutyl isomer (4-HO-MIBT, mp 142â145 Â°C), the secondary butyl isomer (4-HO-MSBT, mp 138â140 Â°C) and the tertiary butyl isomer (4-HO-MTBT, mp 225â226 Â°C). Of these four materials only 4-HO-MTBT has been looked at as a possible psychedelic. Some 15 milligrams produced virtually no effects, maybe a hint of something in a few minutes and then nothing. Probably pure placebo.

Many yet heavier substitution patterns are in the literature but they, too, are unexplored. The symmetrical disubstituted isomers are listed separately in these recipes.

**4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-MPT** or **Meprocin** ) is a novel synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class that produces [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) . It is a closely related structural analog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( *Psilocin* ) and other hallucinogenic tryptamines with powerful psychedelic effects.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-HO-MPT. It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) as of 2016. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It was synthesised and described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1994 book TiHKAL.

## Chemistry

4-HO-MPT, or 4-hydroxy-N,N-methylpropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-MPT is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains a propyl and ethyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [MPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MPT) ).

## Pharmacology

4-HO-MPT is a psychedelic drug in the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamines) class of chemical compounds and is a higher homologue of the naturally occurring substituted tryptamine [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) as well as being the 4-hydroxyl analog of [MPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MPT) .

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, 4-HO-MPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 4-HO-MPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-MPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-MPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried it suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-MPT is generally considered not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-MPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-MPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-MPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-MPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of 4-HO-MPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : 4-HO-MPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-HO-MPT are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Switzerland** : 4-HO-MPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.

4-HO-MPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine or as meprocin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families. It is a higher homologue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) as well as the 4-hydroxyl analogue of N-methyl-N-propyltryptamine (MPT). The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug produces psychedelic-like effects in animals.
4-HO-MPT was first described in the scientific literature by 1981. It was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2021.

## Use and effects

The dose and duration of 4-HO-MPT are listed as "unknown" in Alexander Shulgin's book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). In more recent publications, the dose has been reported to be 20 to 30 mg orally, with a mean dose of 25 mg. In a single trial of 8 mg 4-HO-MPT hydrochloride orally from TiHKAL, it was described as producing visual distortion, vertigo, and slight insomnia.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-MPT acts as a potent agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It is a partial or full agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, a moderate-efficacy partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, and a high-efficacy partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug has more than an order of magnitude higher potency as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors than as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. It also interacts with other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors with high affinity and non-serotonergic targets. Additionally it inhibits serotonin transporter.
4-HO-MPT produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-MPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-HO-MPT include methylpropyltryptamine (MPT), 4-AcO-MPT, 5-MeO-MPT, psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-DET (ethocin), 4-HO-DPT (deprocin), 4-HO-MET (metocin), and 4-HO-PiPT (iprocin), among others.

## History

4-HO-MPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1981. Subsequently, its effects in humans were described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2021.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### International

4-HO-MPT is not scheduled by the United Nations' Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

#### United States

4-HO-MPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it is possible that 4-HO-MPT could legally be considered an analog of psilocin, in which case, sales or possession with intent for human consumption could potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.
