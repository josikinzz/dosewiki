## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as gamma amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids having a (-NH2) group attached to the gamma carbon atom.

### Background

Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (
GABA
) that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993.
16
It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures
14
,
5
- today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain.
8
,
10
Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.
5
,
3
,
16
. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative,
pregabalin
.

### Indication

In the United States, gabapentin is officially indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults and for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 3 years of age and older.
16
In Europe, gabapentin is indicated for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary generalization, in patients 6 years of age and older and as monotherapy in patients 12 years of age and older. It is also used in adults for the treatment of various types of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as painful diabetic neuropathy.
19

### Pharmacodynamics

Gabapentin is an anti-convulsant medication that inhibits the release of excitatory neurotransmitters, allowing for its use against pathologic neurotransmission such as that seen in neuropathic pain and seizure disorders.
16
,
19
It has a wide therapeutic index, with doses in excess of 8000 mg/kg failing to cause a fatal reaction in rats.
21
Gabapentin is ineffective in absence seizures and should be used in caution in patients with mixed seizure disorders involving absence seizures. Gabapentin has been associated with drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), otherwise known as multi-organ hypersensitivity. This reaction can prove fatal and early symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and rash should be promptly investigated.
16
,
17
,
19

### Mechanism of Action

Voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit alpha-2/delta-1
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Absorption of gabapentin is thought to occur solely via facilitated transport by the LAT1 transporter within the intestines.
5
As this process is saturable, the oral bioavailability of gabapentin is inversely proportional to the administered dose - the oral bioavailability of a 900mg/day regimen is approximately 60%, whereas a 4800mg/day regimen results in only 27% bioavailability.
16
,
18
The T
max
of gabapentin has been estimated to be 2-3 hours.
17
,
5
Food has no appreciable effect on gabapentin absorption.
16
,
18

### Metabolism

Gabapentin is not appreciably metabolized in humans
16
,
17
- in humans, metabolites account for less than 1% of an administered dose, with the remainder being excreted as unchanged parent drug in the urine.
5

### Half-life

The elimination t
1/2
of gabapentin in patients with normal renal function is 5-7 hours.
16
,
17
,
5
In patients with reduced renal function, the elimination t
1/2
may be prolonged - in patients with a creatinine clearance of <30 mL/min, the reported half-life of gabapentin was approximately 52 hours.
16
,
17

### Toxicity

The oral TDLo of gabapentin in humans is 2.86 mg/kg and the LD
50
in rats has been found to be >8000 mg/kg.
21
Symptoms of overdose are consistent with the drug's adverse effect profile and involve CNS depression (e.g. dizziness, drowsiness, slurred speech, lethargy, loss of consciousness) and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea.
18
,
17
Management of overdose should involve symptomatic and supportive treatment. Gabapentin can be removed by hemodialysis - this may be of benefit in some patients, such as those with impaired renal function.
20
Multi-drug overdoses involving gabapentin, particularly in combination with other CNS depressants such as opioids, can result in coma and death - this possibility should be considered when managing overdosage.
17

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Acetazolamide
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Acetazolamide is combined with Gabapentin.
Acetophenazine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with Acetophenazine.
Agomelatine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Gabapentin is combined with Agomelatine.
Alfentanil
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Alfentanil is combined with Gabapentin.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol. Gabapentin possesses CNS depressant activity that may be potentiated by co-administration with alcohol.
Take with or without food. Co-administration with food slightly alters pharmacokinetics, but not to a clinically significant extent.

### Mechanism of action

The precise mechanism through which gabapentin exerts its therapeutic effects is unclear.
16
,
17
The primary mode of action appears to be at the auxillary α2δ-1 subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels (though a low affinity for the α2δ-2 subunit has also been reported).
10
,
8
,
14
The major function of these subunits is to facilitate the movement of pore-forming α1 subunits of calcium channels from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell membrane of pre-synaptic neurons.
10
There is evidence that chronic pain states can cause an increase in the expression of α2δ subunits and that these changes correlate with hyperalgesia.
8
Gabapentin appears to inhibit the action of α2δ-1 subunits, thus decreasing the density of pre-synaptic voltage-gated calcium channels and subsequent release of excitatory neurotransmitters.
10
It is likely that this inhibition is also responsible for the anti-epileptic action of gabapentin.
14
There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors
15
,
12
and voltage-gated potassium channels,
13
though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear.

### Volume of distribution

The apparent volume of distribution of gabapentin after IV administration is 58±6 L.
16
,
17
The drug is found in the CSF in concentrations approximately 9-20% of the corresponding plasma concentrations and is secreted into breast milk in concentrations similar to that seen in plasma.
16
,
17
,
5

### Protein binding

Less than 3% of an orally administered dose of gabapentin is bound to plasma proteins.
16
,
17

### Route of elimination

Gabapentin is eliminated solely in the urine as unchanged drug.
16
,
17
Cimetidine, an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion, reduces clearance by approximately 12%, suggesting that some degree of tubular secretion is involved in the renal elimination of gabapentin.
5

### Clearance

Both the plasma clearance and renal clearance of gabapentin are directly proportional to the patient's creatinine clearance due to its primarily renal elimination.

### General Function

The heterodimer with SLC3A2 functions as a sodium-independent, high-affinity transporter that mediates uptake of large neutral amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, leucine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, valine, isoleucine and alanine (PubMed:10049700, PubMed:10574970, PubMed:11557028, PubMed:11564694, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:15769744, PubMed:18262359, PubMed:25998567, PubMed:30867591, PubMed:9751058). The heterodimer with SLC3A2 mediates the uptake of L-DOPA (By similarity). Functions as an amino acid exchanger (PubMed:11557028, PubMed:12117417, PubMed:12225859, PubMed:30867591). May play a role in the transport of L-DOPA across the blood-brain barrier (By similarity). May act as the major transporter of tyrosine in fibroblasts (Probable). May mediate blood-to-retina L-leucine transport across the inner blood-retinal barrier (By similarity). Can mediate the transport of thyroid hormones diiodothyronine (T2), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) across the cell membrane (PubMed:11564694). When associated with LAPTM4B, the heterodimer formed by SLC3A2 and SLC7A5 is recruited to lysosomes to promote leucine uptake into these organelles, and thereby mediates mTORC1 activation (PubMed:25998567). Involved in the uptake of toxic methylmercury (MeHg) when administered as the L-cysteine or D,L-homocysteine complexes (PubMed:12117417). Involved in the cellular activity of small molecular weight nitrosothiols, via the stereoselective transport of L-nitrosocysteine (L-CNSO) across the membrane (PubMed:15769744)

- **Anticipated: Onset / Duration:** 1 Hour / 8 Hours
- **Maximum Dose Experienced:** 300mg + 300mg
- **RoA:** Oral

## Subjective Experience

First introduced in the 1970s, and initially approved to treat epilepsy, gabapentin is
now prescribed to treat a number of ailments, including seizures, neuropathic pain
and restless leg syndrome. However, its anxiolytic and quasi-euphoric effects have
also led to its use as a recreational drug. I have seen it described as a mild benzo, but
with dramatically smaller returns on repeat doses during a session. It is also known
for tolerance to build very quickly.

My supply came in the form of 300mg capsules, which is handy given that most
online reference sources quote thresholds in multiples of 300. Given that some of
these suggest topping the first dose up after perhaps 30 minutes to an hour, I elect to
start with 300mg and then perhaps add another 300mg downstream. This should
pitch me well into common territory, but in two simple stages.

In terms of anticipation, I’m not quite sure what to expect. Further, I am torn with
contradiction: I am still tempted to go for a higher dose, yet at the same time I don’t
really consider this class of drug to be my thing. In the end, sense prevails.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I swallow a 300mg capsule with a glass of water. [1:00pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:45 A heady mellow feeling is now emerging. It is minor at present, but
certainly noticeable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:30 I am not euphoric or uplifted, but that head driven aura referred to in
the last note is now well established. There are no fireworks, but my
headspace has been calmed, and anxieties have disappeared.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I remain in the same warm and softened zone as I decide to take my
usual afternoon nap. I have little problem falling into a sleep.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I am now awake again, and mentally I am back into a similar place.
There is a hint of physical analgesia with this, and the gentle ambience of the
sedation persists nicely. I eat and enjoy a decent meal.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 The intensity has now reduced significantly, and despite having left it
much later than intended I am left wondering whether to redose. After some
consideration I open a capsule and take another 300mg.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:30 I am experiencing a sort of cerebral numbness, but without a real
high. I feel tranquillised without being tired or weary. There’s been no obvious
kick from the second dose, but perhaps it has intensified the plateau.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+8:00 Given the slightly unworldly sense that pervades vision, there is a
minor hypnotic feel in play. My hands remain a little numb too. The intensity
is now lower, but I remain in a gentle bubble of neutrality.
\`\`\`
I retired to bed at about 11pm, 10 hours after the initial intake. The night’s sleep
wasn’t bad, and the headache that I thought I had in the middle of it wasn’t really
there in the morning, although I felt a bit flat. This flatness lingered all day.

I found this to be strongish at times, in a hypnotic rather than a euphoric sense. It
delivered both a mood and a physical numbness, which produced contentment
rather than enjoyment. This isn’t to say that it wasn’t a reasonably pleasant ride
though, and I should note that the second dose was totally unwarranted.

With respect to a comparison with benzodiazepines, it subjectively carried less lift,
although this could have been partly due to my prevailing mood and circumstance.

**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Gabapentin** (also known as **Neurontin** ) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [gabapentinoid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoid) class. It is a structural analog of the [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) and acts by inhibiting certain calcium channels in the brain, namely α2δ subunit-containing voltage-dependent calcium channels (VGCCs).

Gabapentin was originally developed to treat epilepsy and is currently FDA approved to treat postherpetic neuralgia in adults and as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures. It is often prescribed off-label for [restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome) , social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder.

However Gabapentin's efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders is unclear as the evidence is "somewhat mixed". It is recommended as a first line agent for the treatment of neuropathic pain arising from diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and central neuropathic pain.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include mild to moderate [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , and [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) . Its analgesic and anxiolytic effects provide gabapentin with some recreational potential in a manner that can be compared to a mild [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) . However, these recreational effects are reported to diminish quickly with repeated usage and are typically reported by those who do not have a tolerance to this compound.

Gabapentin is considered to have low abuse potential compared to most recreational depressants. However, chronic use can lead to physical dependence. Additionally, there is a increased risk of fatal overdose when it is combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) (a somewhat common practice considering its weak effects). It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Gabapentin is a 3,3-disubstituted derivative of GABA. Therefore, it is a GABA analogue, as well as a γ-amino acid. Specifically, it is a derivative of GABA with a pentyl disubstitution at 3 position, hence, the name - gaba *pentin* , in such a way as to form a six-membered ring. After formation of the ring, the amine and carboxylic groups are not in the same relative positions as they are in the GABA:. they are more conformationally constrained.

Gabapentin, or 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexylacetic acid, is an analogue of the neurotransmitter [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) . It contains a cyclohexane ring bound to a methylamino chain CH 3 NH 2 . At the same location, R 1 , the cyclohexane ring is also substituted with an acetic acid group. Gabapentin is structurally analogous to GABA. GABA contains an amino group bound to the terminal carbon of a butanoic acid chain. The structure of gabapentin contains the secondary carbon R 3 of the butanoic acid chain in GABA incorporated into an attached cyclohexane ring, converting it into a tertiary carbon while still maintaining the chain.

## Pharmacology

Gabapentin modulates the action of [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) decarboxylase (GAD) and branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT), two enzymes involved in [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) biosynthesis. In human and rat studies, gabapentin was found to increase GABA biosynthesis, and to increase non-synaptic GABA neurotransmission in vitro. As the GABA system is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its increase in biosynthesis results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of gabapentin on the nervous system.

Another study based on magnetic resonance imaging done at 7 Tesla confirms that Gabapentin appears to increase cerebral GABA concentrations acutely, in vivo, by up to 79% from baseline.

Gabapentin, as a gabapentinoid, has also been shown to bind to the α2δ-1 subunit of Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels to act as a VGCC blocker, which contributes to its inhibitory, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects. It is uncertain exactly how this method of action contributes to gabapentin's psychoactive effects.

The bioavailability of gabapentin is relatively low and is inversely proportional to the dose (i.e. higher doses have lower bioavailability than lower doses). The bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 60%, 47%, 34%, 33%, and 27% following 900, 1200, 2400, 3600, and 4800 mg/day, given in divided doses of one pill per every 8 hours. Gabapentin is highly lipophilic, making unsaturated fats such as vegetable oil and olive oil significantly boost the total amount of absorption. This means that eating a high fat meal substantially increases gabapentin's bioavailability, due to the fact that unsaturated fats bind to gabapentin to allow for absorption, and that meals slow down and thus increase gabapentin absorption by decreasing gabapentin transporter saturation.

Gabapentin transporter saturation occurs when large enough doses of gabapentin are consumed in a short enough period of time to result in the body being unable to absorb any more gabapentin, causing a significant reduction in bioavailability, which largely accounts for the drop in bioavailability seen with increasing doses.

Gabapentin is a potent activator of voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ3 and KCNQ5, even at low nanomolar concentrations. However, this activation is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of gabapentin's therapeutic effects.

## Subjective effects

The decreasing bioavailability of gabapentin can be lessened by taking lower doses more often instead of higher doses less frequently. As a general rule, using any more than 250-300 mg of gabapentin every 30-45 minutes will result in wasting a significant portion of the total dose of gabapentin, although this number varies depending on the individual. Alkaline environments inhibit the absorption of gabapentin, so lowering the pH of one's stomach using acidic substances (such as soft drinks) will boost bioavailability as well. It is generally not recommended to take antacids 2 hours before or after taking gabapentin, because although not dangerous, it will severely lower the total absorption of gabapentin.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Gabapentin is typically mildly sedating and can produce a lethargic state. At higher doses, it may lead to a moderately sedated state.
- **[Appetite enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_enhancement)** - Appetite enhancement is not particularly prominent, but is sometimes reported. It can have a synergistic effect when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) .
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - Muscle relaxation is present on gabapentin, although not to the extent of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , or [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) .
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Gabapentin is capable of producing weak to moderate states of physical euphoria in some users. However, it is very inconsistent compared to other depressants (e.g. [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , and [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) ) and tolerance builds rapidly. As a result, it is considered to be a poor euphoriant.
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** - Many users note a marked decrease in their sex drive when taking gabapentin. This can happen when it is taken both recreationally or as prescribed.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - Some users report feeling lighter at very high doses.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)** - Dizziness is prevalent at higher doses, although many users report that it is not necessarily distressing. However, users should be careful not to slip and fall when walking down slopes or stairs.
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Gabapentin is commonly used as an anticonvulsant. It is often combined with other anticonvulsants when used to treat epilepsy and other seizure disorders.
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)** - Gabapentin is used to control pain, particularly fibromyalgic/neuropathic pain (nerve pain) and [restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is generally considered to be not very effective for the management of acute pain, unlike [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) .
- **[Muscle twitching](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_twitching)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)** *and* **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)** - At very high doses, gabapentin can induce a mild dissociative state.
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Gabapentin induces a substantially lower amount of amnesia compared to other [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) drugs such as [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) .
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)**
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - At higher doses, some users report mild to strong closed eye visuals (CEVs). These can include but are not limited to [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) -like [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and landscapes. It has been noted that smoking [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) greatly potentiates these effects.
 
#### Disconnective effects
 
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This effect is generally quite mild and appears inconsistently at very high doses. It results in feeling as if one's sense of vision is distant or vague and being viewed through a screen or window. However, it is not capable of higher levels of visual disconnection that produce [holes, spaces, and voids](/w/index.php?title=Holes,_spaces,_and_voids&action=edit&redlink=1) or [hallucinatory structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures) in the same way that traditional [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) can.

## Toxicity and harm potential

GABApentin has a low toxicity relative to dose. The most common side effects of gabapentin in adult patients include dizziness, fatigue, drowsiness, weight gain, and peripheral edema (swelling of extremities). Gabapentin may also produce sexual dysfunction in some patients whose symptoms of which may include loss of libido, inability to reach orgasm, and erectile dysfunction. Gabapentin should be used carefully in patients with renal impairment due to possible accumulation and toxicity.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Suicide

In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning of an increased risk of depression and suicidal thoughts and behaviors in patients taking gabapentin (along with other [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) drugs), modifying the packaging insert to reflect this. A 2010 meta-analysis confirmed the increased risk of suicide associated with gabapentin use.

In 2010, a study conducted by Patorno E, Bohn RL, Wahl PM, et al, found that the use of gabapentin compared to the use of [topiramate](/w/index.php?title=Topiramate&action=edit&redlink=1) may be associated with an increase in suicidal acts and or violent deaths.

It should be noted that in both studies along with others that the patients evaluated had a higher suicide risk and the studies were both limited and imprecise.

### Lethal dosage

People who accidentally or intentionally overdose may experience drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence and possibly death (if a very high amount was taken and particularly if combined with alcohol). Serum gabapentin concentrations may be measured to confirm diagnosis.

### Dependence and abuse potential

Gabapentin is not considered psychologically addictive. However, it is possible to develop a physical dependence on the drug. In fact, people can experience withdrawal symptoms for up to 45 days after they stop taking gabapentin. Although gabapentin does give some people a euphoric “high” which can cause abuse, gabapentin abusers do not present with the kind of compulsive, drug-seeking behavior or strong cravings associated with other more common depressants such as [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) .

Tolerance will develop to the anxiolytic effects with prolonged continuous usage. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7-14 days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction.

### Dangerous interactions

- **Opioids** - Combining opioids with gabapentin can cause death from respiratory failure.
- **Depressants (GABAergic)** - Gabapentin significantly potentiates the effects of [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) and other [GABAergics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) which may lead to blackouts, and dangerous behaviour.

Gabapentin is a GABA-like drug that has been used medically in the treatment of epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and other conditions.

It has also been used recreationally due to its anxiolytic, sedative, and euphoriant effects.

Even at high strong+ doses, gabapentin is relatively safe physically, but there are still risks and it can certainly cause death.

Gabapentin, sold under the brand name Neurontin among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used to treat neuropathic pain (postherpetic neuralgia) and partial seizures of epilepsy. Gabapentin is a
central nervous system (CNS) depressant and derivative of GABA. It is used for the treatment of neuropathic pain caused by diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and central pain. It is moderately effective: about 30–40% of those given gabapentin for diabetic neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia have a meaningful benefit.
Gabapentin acts by decreasing activity of the α2δ-1 protein, coded by the CACNA2D1 gene, first known as an auxiliary subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels. By binding to α2δ-1, gabapentin reduces the release of excitatory neurotransmitters (primarily glutamate) and as a result, reduces excess excitation of neuronal networks in the spinal cord and brain. Sleepiness and dizziness are the most common side effects. Serious side effects include respiratory depression and allergic reactions. On December 16, 2008, the FDA issued gabapentin a class warning for an increased risk of suicide. Approximately two years after this pronouncement, a pharmacoepidemiologic study was conducted that showed there was no outstanding difference in suicide attempt rates between pre and post gabapentin prescription groups.
Gabapentin was first approved for use in the United Kingdom in 1993. It has been available as a generic medication in the United States since 2004. It is the first of several other drugs that are similar in structure and mechanism, called gabapentinoids. In 2023, it was the ninth most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 45 million prescriptions. During the 1990s, Parke-Davis, a subsidiary of Pfizer, used several illegal techniques to encourage physicians in the United States to prescribe gabapentin for unapproved uses. They have paid out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits regarding these activities.

## Medical uses

In the US, gabapentin is indicated for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia; and the adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures without secondary generalization, in people with epilepsy.
Gabapentin is recommended for use in focal seizures and neuropathic pain. Gabapentin is prescribed off-label in the US and the UK, for example, for the treatment of non-neuropathic pain, anxiety disorders, sleep problems and bipolar disorder. In recent years, gabapentin has seen increased use, particularly in the elderly. There is concern regarding gabapentin's off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for its efficacy in multiple conditions, its proven side effects and its potential for misuse and physical/psychological dependency. Some harms, including nervous system harms, have been underreported in published trials of gabapentin, potentially resulting in the underestimation of harms in guidelines for the use of gabapentin.

### Seizures

Gabapentin is approved for the treatment of focal seizures; however, it is not effective for generalized epilepsy.

### Neuropathic pain

Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment for chronic neuropathic pain by various medical authorities. This is a general recommendation applicable to all neuropathic pain syndromes except for trigeminal neuralgia, where it may be used as a second- or third-line agent.
Regarding the specific diagnoses, a systematic review has found evidence for gabapentin to provide pain relief for some people with postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Gabapentin is approved for the former indication in the US. In addition to these two neuropathies, European Federation of Neurological Societies guideline notes gabapentin effectiveness for central pain. A combination of gabapentin with an opioid or nortriptyline may work better than either drug alone.
Evidence finds little or no benefit and significant risk in those with chronic low back pain or sciatica. Gabapentin is not effective in HIV-associated sensory neuropathy and neuropathic pain due to cancer.

### Anxiety

There is a small amount of research on the use of gabapentin for the treatment of anxiety disorders.
Gabapentin is effective for the long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder and in reducing preoperative anxiety.
In a controlled trial of breast cancer survivors with anxiety, and a trial for social phobia, gabapentin significantly reduced anxiety levels.
For panic disorder, gabapentin has produced mixed results.

### Sleep

Gabapentin is effective in treating sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome that are the result of an underlying illness, but comes with some risk of discontinuation and withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use at higher doses.
Gabapentin enhances slow-wave sleep in people with primary insomnia. It also improves sleep quality by elevating sleep efficiency and decreasing spontaneous arousal.

### Drug dependence

Gabapentin is moderately effective in reducing the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and associated craving. The evidence in favor of gabapentin is weak in the treatment of alcoholism: it does not contribute to the achievement of abstinence, and the data on the relapse of heavy drinking and percent of days abstinent do not robustly favor gabapentin; it only decreases the percent days of heavy drinking.
Gabapentin is ineffective in cocaine dependence and methamphetamine use, and it does not increase the rate of smoking cessation. While some studies indicate that gabapentin does not significantly reduce the symptoms of opiate withdrawal, there is increasing evidence that gabapentinoids are effective in controlling some of the symptoms during opiate detoxification. A clinical study in Iran, where heroin dependence is a significant social and public health problem, showed gabapentin produced positive results during an inpatient therapy program, particularly by reducing opioid-induced hyperalgesia and drug craving. There is insufficient evidence for its use in cannabis dependence.

### Other

Gabapentin is recommended as a first-line treatment of the acquired pendular nystagmus, torsional nystagmus, and infantile nystagmus; however, it does not work in periodic alternating nystagmus.
Gabapentin decreases the frequency of hot flashes in both menopausal women and people with breast cancer. However, antidepressants have similar efficacy, and treatment with estrogen more effectively prevents hot flashes.
Gabapentin reduces spasticity in multiple sclerosis and is prescribed as one of the first-line options. It is an established treatment of restless legs syndrome. Gabapentin alleviates itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It may be an option in essential or orthostatic tremor.
Gabapentin does not appear to provide benefit for bipolar disorder, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical pain, or tinnitus, or prevent episodic migraine in adults.
Gabapentin is prescribed off-label as a anxiolytic or anti-anxiety medication, although not as effective as pregabalin in this regard, especially for generalized anxiety disorder, as gabapentin is more effective for social anxiety disorder.

## Contraindications

Gabapentin should be used carefully and at lower doses in people with kidney problems due to possible accumulation and toxicity. It is unclear if it is safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding.

## Side effects

In a systematic review analysing data from five cohort studies having 1,085,488 patients, use of gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thrombo-embolism) as early as three months of use, and with increased risk of cardiovascular events on prolonged use of more than a year duration. Heart failure was not increased with the use of gabapentinoids.

Dizziness and somnolence are the most frequent side effects. Fatigue, ataxia, peripheral edema (swelling of extremities), and nystagmus are also common. A 2017 meta-analysis found that gabapentin also increased the risk of difficulties in mentation and visual disturbances as compared to a placebo. Gabapentin is associated with a weight gain of 2.2 kg (4.9 lb) after 1.5 months of use. Case studies indicate that it may cause anorgasmia and erectile dysfunction, as well as myoclonus that disappear after discontinuing gabapentin or replacing it with other medication. Fever, swollen glands that do not go away, eyes or skin turning yellow, unusual bruises or bleeding, unexpected muscle pain or weakness, rash, long-lasting stomach pain which may indicate an inflamed pancreas, hallucinations, anaphylaxis, respiratory depression, and increased suicidal ideation are rare but serious side effects.

### Suicide

The gabapentin prescribing information contains a warning of an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. The warning is based on a meta-analysis of all approved antiepileptic drugs in 2008, and not with gabapentin alone. According to an experimental meta-analysis of insurance claims databases, gabapentin use is associated with an approximately 40% increased risk of suicide, suicide attempt, and violent death as compared with a reference anticonvulsant drug topiramate. The risk is increased for people with bipolar disorder or epilepsy. Another study has shown an approximately doubled rate of suicide attempts and self-harm in people with bipolar disorder who are taking gabapentin versus those taking lithium. A large Swedish study suggests that gabapentinoids are associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, unintentional overdoses, head/body injuries, and road traffic incidents and offences. On the other hand, a study published by the Harvard Data Science Review found that gabapentin was associated with a significantly reduced rate of suicide. In addition, a 2010 study published by the Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety journal concluded that although there was no significant suicide rate decrease between the pre-prescription window and the post-prescription window for the non-psychiatric population, significant reductions in suicides rates were observed in psychiatric persons.

### Respiratory depression

Serious breathing suppression, potentially fatal, may occur when gabapentin is taken together with opioids, benzodiazepines, or other depressants, or by people with underlying lung problems such as COPD. Gabapentin and opioids are commonly prescribed or abused together, and research indicates that the breathing suppression they cause is additive. For example, gabapentin use before joint replacement or laparoscopic surgery increased the risk of respiratory depression by 30–60%. A Canadian study showed that use of gabapentin and other gabapentinoids, whether for epilepsy, neuropathic pain or other chronic pain was associated with a 35–58% increased risk for severe exacerbation of pre-existing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Withdrawal and dependence

Withdrawal symptoms typically occur 1–2 days after abruptly stopping gabapentin (almost unambiguously due to extended use and during a very short-term rebound phenomenon) — similar to, albeit less intense than most benzodiazepines. Agitation, confusion and disorientation are the most frequently reported, followed by gastrointestinal complaints and sweating, and more rare tremor, tachycardia, hypertension and insomnia. In some cases, users experience withdrawal seizures after chronic or semi-chronic use in the absence of periodic cycles or breaks during repeating and consecutive use. All these symptoms subside when gabapentin is re-instated or tapered off gradually at an appropriate rate.
On its own, gabapentin appears not to have a substantial addictive power. In human and animal experiments, it shows limited to no rewarding effects. The vast majority of people abusing gabapentin are current or former abusers of opioids or sedatives. In these persons, gabapentin can boost the opioid "high" as well as decrease commonly experienced opioid-withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety.

### Psychiatric and behavioral adverse effects

Gabapentin is sometimes recognized to cause a range of psychiatric and behavioral adverse effects that extend beyond its more common neurological side effects. Systematic reviews have documented atypical manifestations such as aggression, agitation, irritability, mood instability, and suicidal ideation, with some cases noting the emergence of mania, hallucinations, and psychosis, particularly in pediatric populations and individuals with preexisting psychiatric conditions.
Large cohort studies and post-marketing surveillance indicate that neuropsychiatric symptoms—including confusion, depression, and behavioral disturbances—can occur in up to 29% of gabapentin users. Most reactions are mild to moderate and often dose-dependent. There is also evidence associating gabapentin with an increased risk of suicidal behavior, especially in younger patients, and rare reports of violent or aggressive behavior. Causality is difficult to establish, and such events remain uncommon.

## Overdose

Through excessive ingestion, accidental or otherwise, persons may experience overdose symptoms including drowsiness, sedation, blurred vision, slurred speech, somnolence, uncontrollable jerking motions, and anxiety. A very high amount taken is associated with breathing suppression, coma, and possibly death, particularly if combined with alcohol or opioids.

## Pharmacology

### Animal models

Gabapentin prevents seizures in a dose-related manner in several laboratory animal models. These models include spinal extensor seizures from low-intensity electroshock to the forebrain in mice, maximal electroshock in rats, spinal extensor seizures in DBA/2 mice with a genetic sensitivity to seizures induced by loud noise, and in rats "kindled" to produce focal seizures by repeated prior electrical stimulation of the hippocampus. Gabapentin slightly increased spontaneous absence-like seizures in a genetically susceptible strain recorded with electroencephalography. All of these effects of gabapentin were seen at dosages at or below the threshold for producing ataxia.
Gabapentin has been tested in a variety of animal models that are relevant for analgesic actions. Generally, gabapentin is not active to prevent pain-related behaviors in models of acute nociceptive pain. It prevents pain-related behaviors when animals are made sensitive by prior peripheral inflammation or peripheral nerve damage (inflammatory or neuropathic conditions).

### Pharmacodynamics

Gabapentin is a ligand of the α2δ calcium channel subunit. The α2δ-1 protein is coded by the CACNA2D1 gene. α2δ was first described as an auxiliary protein connected to the main α1 subunit (the channel-forming protein) of high voltage activated voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-type, N-type, P/Q type, and R-type). The same α2δ protein has more recently been shown to interact directly with some NMDA-type and AMPA-type glutamate receptors at presynaptic sites and also with thrombospondin (an extracellular matrix protein secreted by astroglial cells).
Gabapentin is not a direct calcium channel blocker: it exerts its actions by disrupting the regulatory function of α2δ and its interactions with other proteins. Gabapentin reduces delivery of intracellular calcium channels to the cell membrane, reduces the activation of the channels by the α2δ subunit, decreases signaling to lead to neurotransmitters release, and disrupts interactions of α2δ with voltage gated calcium channels but also with NMDA receptors, neurexins, and thrombospondin. These proteins are found as mutually interacting parts of the presynaptic active zone, where numerous protein molecules interact with each other to enable and to regulate the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic vesicles into the synaptic space.
Out of the four known isoforms of α2δ protein, gabapentin binds with similar high affinity to two: α2δ-1 and α2δ-2. All of the pharmacological properties of gabapentin tested to date are explained by its binding to just one isoform – α2δ-1.
The endogenous α-amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine, which resemble gabapentin in chemical structure, bind α2δ with similar affinity to gabapentin and are present in human cerebrospinal fluid at micromolar concentrations. They may be the endogenous ligands of the α2δ subunit, and they competitively antagonize the effects of gabapentin. Accordingly, while gabapentin has nanomolar affinity for the α2δ subunit, its potency in vivo is in the low micromolar range, and competition for binding by endogenous L-amino acids is likely to be responsible for this discrepancy.
Gabapentin is a potent activator of voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ3 and KCNQ5, even at low nanomolar concentrations. However, this activation is unlikely to be the dominant mechanism of gabapentin's therapeutic effects.
Gabapentin is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter glutamate and competitively inhibits branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT), slowing down the synthesis of glutamate. In particular, it inhibits BCAT-1 at high concentrations (Ki = 1 mM), but not BCAT-2. At very high concentrations, gabapentin can suppress the growth of cancer cells, presumably by affecting mitochondrial catabolism; however, the precise mechanism remains elusive.
Even though gabapentin is a structural GABA analog, and despite its name, it does not bind to the GABA receptors, does not convert into GABATooltip γ-aminobutyric acid or another GABA receptor agonist in vivo, and does not modulate GABA transport or metabolism within the range of clinical dosing. In vitro gabapentin has been found to very weakly inhibit the GABA aminotransferase enzyme (Ki = 17–20 mM); however, this effect is so weak that it is not clinically relevant at prescribed doses.

### Pharmacokinetics

Gabapentin is absorbed from the intestines by an active transport process mediated via an amino acid transporter, presumably, LAT2. As a result, the pharmacokinetics of gabapentin is dose-dependent, with diminished bioavailability and delayed peak levels at higher doses.
The oral bioavailability of gabapentin is approximately 80% at 100 mg administered three times daily once every 8 hours, but decreases to 60% at 300 mg, 47% at 400 mg, 34% at 800 mg, 33% at 1,200 mg, and 27% at 1,600 mg, all with the same dosing schedule. Drugs that increase the transit time of gabapentin in the small intestine can increase its oral bioavailability; when gabapentin was co-administered with oral morphine, the oral bioavailability of a 600 mg dose of gabapentin increased by 50%.
Gabapentin at a low dose of 100 mg has a Tmax (time to peak levels) of approximately 1.7 hours, while the Tmax increases to 3 to 4 hours at higher doses. Food does not significantly affect the Tmax of gabapentin and increases the Cmax and area-under-curve levels of gabapentin by approximately 10%.
Gabapentin can cross the blood–brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. Gabapentin concentration in cerebrospinal fluid is approximately 9–14% of its blood plasma concentration. Due to its low lipophilicity, gabapentin requires active transport across the blood–brain barrier. The LAT1 is highly expressed at the blood–brain barrier and transports gabapentin across into the brain. As with intestinal absorption mediated by an amino acid transporter, the transport of gabapentin across the blood–brain barrier by LAT1 is saturable. Gabapentin does not bind to other drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) or OCTN2 (SLC22A5). It is not significantly bound to plasma proteins (<1%).
Gabapentin undergoes little or no metabolism.
Gabapentin is generally safe in people with liver cirrhosis.
Gabapentin is eliminated renally in the urine. It has a relatively short elimination half-life, with the reported average value of 5 to 7 hours. Because of its short elimination half-life, gabapentin must be administered 3 to 4 times per day to maintain therapeutic levels. Gabapentin XR (brand name Gralise) is taken once a day.

## Chemistry

Gabapentin is a 3,3-disubstituted derivative of GABA. Therefore, it is a GABA analog, as well as a γ-amino acid. It is similar to several other compounds that collectively are called gabapentinoids. Specifically, it is a derivative of GABA with a pentyl disubstitution at 3 position, hence, the name - gabapentin, in such a way as to form a six-membered ring. After the formation of the ring, the amine and carboxylic groups are not in the same relative positions as they are in the GABA; they are more conformationally constrained.
Although it has been known for some time that gabapentin must bind to the α2δ-1 protein in order to act pharmacologically (see Pharmacodynamics), the three-dimensional structure of the α2δ-1 protein with gabapentin bound (or alternatively, the native amino acid, L-Isoleucine bound) has only recently been obtained by cryo-electron microscopy. A figure of this drug-bound structure is shown in the Chemistry section of the entry on gabapentinoid drugs. This study confirms other findings to show that both compounds alternatively can bind at a single extracellular site (somewhat distant from the calcium conducting pore of the voltage gated calcium channel α1 subunit) on the calcium channel and chemotaxis (Cache1) domain of α2δ-1.

### Synthesis

A process for chemical synthesis and isolation of gabapentin with high yield and purity starts with conversion of 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic anhydride to 1,1-cyclohexanediacetic acid monoamide and is followed by a 'Hofmann' rearrangement in an aqueous solution of sodium hypobromite prepared in situ.

## History

GABA is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter in mammalian brains. By the early 1970s, it was appreciated that there are two main classes of GABA receptors, GABAA and GABAB and also that baclofen was an agonist of GABAB receptors. Gabapentin was designed, synthesized, and tested in mice by researchers at the pharmaceutical company Goedecke AG in Freiburg, Germany (a subsidiary of Parke-Davis). It was meant to be a structural analog of the neurotransmitter GABA that could more easily cross the blood–brain barrier. It was first synthesized in 1974/75 and described in 1975 by Satzinger and Hartenstein.
The first pharmacology findings published were sedating properties and prevention of seizures in mice evoked by the GABA antagonist, thiosemicarbazide. Shortly after, gabapentin was shown in vitro to reduce the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine from slices of rat caudate nucleus (striatum). This study provided evidence that the action of gabapentin, unlike baclofen, did not arise from the GABAB receptor.
Initial clinical trials utilizing small numbers of subjects were for treatment of spasticity and migraine but neither study had statistical power to allow conclusions. In 1987, the first positive results with gabapentin were obtained in a clinical trial using three dose groups versus pre-treatment seizure frequency for 75 days, as add-on treatment in patients who still had seizures despite taking other medications.
Under the brand name Neurontin, it was first approved in the United Kingdom in May 1993, for the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Approval by the US Food and Drug Administration followed in December 1993, also for use as an adjuvant (effective when added to other antiseizure drugs) medication to control partial seizures in adults; that indication was extended to children in 2000. Subsequently, gabapentin was approved in the United States for the treatment of pain from postherpetic neuralgia in 2002. A generic version of gabapentin first became available in the United States in 2004. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration, under the brand name Gralise, was approved in the United States for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in January 2011.
Gabapentin has been prescribed for a variety of disorders and is one of the more common medications used, particularly in elderly people.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### United Kingdom

Effective April 2019, the United Kingdom reclassified the drug as a class C controlled substance.

#### United States

Gabapentin is not a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. Effective in July 2017, Kentucky classified gabapentin as a Schedule V controlled substance statewide. Gabapentin is a schedule V drug in other states such as West Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama, Utah, and Virginia.

### Off-label promotion

Although some small, non-controlled studies in the 1990s—mostly sponsored by gabapentin's manufacturer—suggested that treatment for bipolar disorder with gabapentin may be promising, the preponderance of evidence suggests that it is not effective.

#### Franklin v. Parke-Davis case

After the corporate acquisition of the original patent holder, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer admitted that there had been violations of FDA guidelines regarding the promotion of unproven off-label uses for gabapentin in the Franklin v. Parke-Davis case.
While off-label prescriptions are common for many drugs, marketing of off-label uses of a drug is not. In 2004, Warner-Lambert (which subsequently was acquired by Pfizer) agreed to plead guilty for activities of its Parke-Davis subsidiary, and to pay \$430 million in fines to settle civil and criminal charges regarding the marketing of Neurontin for off-label purposes. The 2004 settlement was one of the largest in U.S. history up to that point, and the first off-label promotion case brought successfully under the False Claims Act.
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan sued Pfizer Inc., alleging that the pharmaceutical company had misled Kaiser by recommending Neurontin as an off-label treatment for certain conditions (including bipolar disorder, migraines, and neuropathic pain). In 2010, a federal jury in Massachusetts ruled in Kaiser's favor, finding that Pfizer violated the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and was liable for US\$47.36 million in damages, which was automatically trebled to just under \$142.1 million. Aetna, Inc. and a group of employer health plans prevailed in their similar Neurontin-related claims against Pfizer. Pfizer appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld the verdict, and in 2013, the US Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

#### Gabasync

Gabasync, a treatment consisting of a combination of gabapentin and two other medications (flumazenil and hydroxyzine) as well as therapy, is an ineffective treatment promoted for methamphetamine addiction. It had also been claimed to be effective for dependence on alcohol or cocaine. It was marketed as PROMETA. While the FDA has approved individual drugs, they have not approved their off-label use for addiction treatment. Gabasync was marketed by Hythiam, Inc., which is owned by Terren Peizer, a former junk bond salesman who has since been convicted of securities fraud relative to another company. Hythiam charges up to \$15,000 per patient to license its use (of which half goes to the prescribing physician, and half to Hythiam).
In a November 2005 article entitled "Curb Your Cravings For This Stock", Barrons wrote: "If the venture works out for patients and the investing public, it'll be a rare success for Peizer, who's promoted a series of disappointing small-cap medical or technology stocks ... since his days at Drexel". 60 Minutes, NBC News, and The Dallas Morning News criticized Peizer after the company bypassed clinical studies and government approval when bringing to market Prometa; the addiction drug proved to be completely ineffective. CBS News journalist Scott Pelley said to Peizer in 2007: "Depending on who you talk to, you're either a revolutionary or a snake oil salesman." Journalist Adam Feuerstein opined: "most of what Peizer says is dubious-sounding hype".
In November 2011, the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study (financed by Hythiam and carried out at UCLA) were published in the peer-reviewed journal Addiction. It concluded that Gabasync is ineffective: "The PROMETA protocol, consisting of flumazenil, gabapentin, and hydroxyzine, appears to be no more effective than placebo in reducing methamphetamine use, retaining patients in treatment, or reducing methamphetamine craving."

#### Usage trends

The consumption of gabapentinoids rose significantly between 2008 and 2018. A study published in 2023 highlights this trend, demonstrating a notable escalation in sales of gabapentinoids. The study, which analyzed healthcare data across 65 countries/ regions, found that the consumption rate of gabapentinoids had doubled over the decade, driven by their use in a wide range of indications.

### Brand names

Gabapentin was originally sold under the brand name Neurontin. Since it became generic, it has been sold worldwide using over 300 different brand names. An extended-release formulation of gabapentin for once-daily administration was introduced in 2011 for postherpetic neuralgia under the brand name Gralise.
In the US, Neurontin is sold by Viatris after Upjohn was spun off from Pfizer.

### Related drugs

Parke-Davis developed a drug called pregabalin, which is related in structure to gabapentin, as a successor to gabapentin. Another similar drug atagabalin has been unsuccessfully tried by Pfizer as a treatment for insomnia. A prodrug form (gabapentin enacarbil) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

### Recreational use

When taken in excess, gabapentin can induce euphoria, a sense of calm, improved sociability, and reduced alcohol or cocaine cravings. Also known on the streets as "Gabbies", gabapentin was reported in 2017 to be increasingly abused and misused for these euphoric effects. About 1 percent of the responders to an Internet poll and 22 percent of those attending addiction facilities had a history of abuse of gabapentin. Gabapentin misuse, toxicity, and use in suicide attempts among adults in the US increased from 2013 to 2017.
After Kentucky implemented stricter legislation regarding opioid prescriptions in 2012, there was an increase in gabapentin-only and multi-drug use from 2012 to 2015. The majority of these cases were from overdose in suspected suicide attempts. Increases in abuse and recreational use accompanied these rates.
Withdrawal symptoms, often resembling those of benzodiazepine withdrawal, play a role in the physical dependence some users experience. Its misuse predominantly coincides with the usage of other CNS depressant drugs, namely opioids, benzodiazepines, and alcohol.

## Veterinary use

In cats, gabapentin can be used as an analgesic in multi-modal pain management, anxiety medication to reduce stress during travel or vet visits, and anticonvulsant.
Veterinarians may prescribe gabapentin as an anticonvulsant and pain reliever in dogs. It has beneficial effects for treating epilepsy, different kinds of pain (chronic, neuropathic, and post-operative pain), and anxiety, lip-licking behavior, storm phobia, fear-based aggression.
It is also used to treat chronic pain-associated nerve inflammation in horses and dogs. Side effects include tiredness and loss of coordination, but these effects generally resolve within 24 hours of starting the medication.
