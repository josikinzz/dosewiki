## Effects
MDA is closely related to MDMA. It differs mainly in how well one's own feelings are perceived (entactogenic effect), how strong empathic understanding (empathic effect) and hallucinogenic effects occur.

## Dosage
1.3 mg per kg body weight (1.3 mg x 80 kg = 100 mg)

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Nausea to nausea, dry mouth, cramping of the jaw muscles, sweating, coordination disorders, sleep disorders and trembling.

### Long-term Risks
MDA is both neurotoxic (damaging to the nerves) and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver); regular use can lead to schizophrenia-like symptoms.

## Safer Use
- First test a third or half a pill.
- Wait two hours for the effect to take effect before adding more.
- With MDA, topping up is pointless, as it is effective for a long time even in small doses.
- Refrain from mixed consumption.
- Avoid alcohol, drink enough non-alcoholic beverages (0.3-0.5 L per hour).
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air in between.
- Take regular breaks from consumption. The body needs time to recover.
- People taking medication are advised to inform themselves about interactions.
