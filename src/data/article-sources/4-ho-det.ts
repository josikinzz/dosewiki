## SYNTHESIS
To a solution of 0.50 g 4-acetoxyindole in 4 mL Et2O, that was stirred and cooled with an external ice bath, there was added, dropwise, a solution of 0.5 mL oxalyl chloride in 3 mL anhydrous Et2O. Stirring was continued for 0.5 h and the intermediate indoleglyoxylchloride separated as a yellow crystalline solid but it was not isolated. There was then added, dropwise, a 40% solution of diethylamine in Et2O until the pH was raised to 8â9. The reaction was then quenched by the addition of 100 mL CHCl3, and the organic phase was washed with 30 mL of 5% NaHSO4 solution, with 30 mL of saturated NaHCO3, and finally with 30 mL of saturated brine. After drying with anhydrous MgSO4, the solvent was removed under vacuum. The residue set up as crystals and, after recrystallization from Et2O, provided 0.62 g (72%) 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-diethylglyoxylamide with a mp of 150â151 Â°C.

A suspension of 0.5 g LAH in 10 mL anhydrous THF was held in an inert atmosphere and vigorously stirred. To this there was added, dropwise, a solution of 0.6 g of 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-diethylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF at a rate that maintained a gentle reflux. After the addition was complete, the refluxing was maintained for an additional 15 min, cooled to 40 Â°C, and the excess hydride killed by the addition of 1.0 mL EtOAc, followed by 2.3 mL H2O. The reaction mixture was filtered free of solids under a N2 atmosphere, washed with THF, and the filtrate and washings combined and stripped of solvent under vacuum. The residue was distilled in a KugelRohr apparatus and the solid distillate recrystallized from EtOAc/hexane to give 0.24 g (52%) 3-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-4-indolol (4-HO-DET) as white crystals with a mp of 103â104 Â°C. The product discolored quickly in the presence of air, and was best stored under an inert atmosphere at -30 Â°C. Conversion to the phosphate ester was achieved by reaction of the sodium salt of 3-[2-(diethylamino)ethyl]-4-indolol with dibenzylchlorophosphonate, followed by the reductive removal of the benzyl groups with catalytic hydrogenation, as described for psilocybin.

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 15 mg phosphate ester, orally) âIt is meaningful to say that I ceased to exist, becoming immersed in the ground of Being, in Brahman, in God, in ânothingness,â in Ultimate Reality, or in some similar religious symbol for oneness. The feelings I experienced could best be described as cosmic tenderness, infinite love, penetrating peace, eternal blessing and unconditional acceptance on one hand and, on the other, as unspeakable awe, overflowing joy, primeval humility, inexpressible gratitude and boundless devotion. Yet, all of these words are hopelessly inadequate and can do little more than meekly point toward the genuine, inexpressible feelings actually experienced. It is misleading even to use the words, âI experienced,â as during the peak of the experience (which must have lasted at least an hour) there was no duality between myself and what I experienced. Rather, I was these feelings, or ceased to be in them and felt no loss at the cessation. Four days after the experience itself, I continue to feel a deep sense of awe and reverence, and am simultaneously intoxicated with an ecstatic joy. This euphoric feeling is in no sense analogous to hebephrenic giddiness; it includes elements of profound peace and steadfastness, surging like a spring from a depth of my being which has rarely, if ever, been tapped prior to the drug experience.â

(with 20 mg orally indolol) âI felt this faster than psilocin, but being twenty mg this is probably less potent.â

(with 20 mg acetate ester, orally) âA mild stomach discomfort for twenty minutes, followed by intoxication to the 40 minute point. A strange mixture of things at an hour, sedation, jaw-tightening, and a generalized body tremor. The light from the fireplace gave me bursts of color. Music allowed me to drift with my thoughts. Anorexia was intense, in fact there was some gut disturbance throughout the day, plus a lot of diuretic effect. Four hours into it I was fine on the telephone to a friend who knew nothing about the day.â

(with 25 mg acetate ester, orally) âThere was nausea and motor incoordination going into this. And my blood pressure went up a bit. The mental part of it all peaked at 90 minutes and all closed-eye effects had stopped after three hours. Another couple of hours and the body seemed to be OK again. Sleep OK, too. I am not impressed with this stuff.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
The ratios of molecular weights for these ethyl homologues, 314 for the phosphate (CEY-19), the same for the sulfate (by the way, itâs not yet explored in man, to my knowledge), 276 for the acetate and 234 for the free phenol (CZ-74), all fall into a pretty narrow range, from about 4 to 3. So, the weight of the ester component in the actual molecule being considered is a relatively minor factor in the dose calculation. I am at peace with the hypothesis that all four compounds are interchangeable in potency.

Some fascinating studies have been done in Germany where the metabolically active mycelium of some Psilocybe species have been administered diethyltryptamine as a potential diet component. Normally, this mushroom species dutifully converts N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) to psilocin, by introducing a 4-hydroxyl group into the molecule by something that is probably called an indole 4-hydroxylase by the biochemists. You put DMT in, and you get 4-hydroxy-DMT out, and this is psilocin. Maybe if you put Mickey Mouse in, you would get 4-hydroxy-Mickey Mouse out. It is as if the mushroom psyche didnât really care what it was working with, it was simply compelled to do its sacred duty to 4-hydroxylate any tryptamine it came across. It was observed that if you put N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET, not a material found in nature) into the growing process, the dutiful and ignorant enzymes would hydroxylate it to 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine (4-HO-DET) a potent drug also not known in nature. This is the title drug of this commentary. What a beautiful burr to thrust into the natural versus synthetic controversy. If a plant (a mushroom mycelium in this case) is given a man-made chemical, and this plant converts it, using its natural capabilities, into a product that had never before been known in nature, is that product natural? What is natural? This is the stuff of many long and pointless essays.

A valuable concept was championed by one of the most respected psychotherapists and academicians in recent years, Hanscarl Leuner, the Chairman of the Psychotherapeutic Department of the University of GÃ¶ttingen. Leuner was convinced that the value of the psychedelic drug was in the opening of the psyche with repeated modest exposures, with therapy carried forth over a period of time. This is the âpsycholyticâ approach to therapy. An opposite approach is called âpsychedelic.â Here there is what might well be a one-time interaction, in which the patient is blasted into orbit with the hopes of his confronting his problem and also finding its solution. When LSD is used in the former approach, in psycholytic dosages, one would expect levels of between 50 and 150 micrograms to be used; in the latter (psychedelic) approach, the dosage would be in the 500 to 1500 microgram range. The first calls upon the activation and development of a process of understanding; the second can be seen as a religious crisis, or a conversion event. In Europe, the first was favored, but there were strong advocates (Unger, Pahnke, Grof) in the United States favoring the latter process. Here, CZ-74 was thought to be suitable only in the psycholytic role, in that it was too short lived and, at high doses, there was a restlessness and body disturbance that was not usually seen with LSD.

There is a second instructive point to be learned from Leuner. It was he who had made early observations of the psychological effects of CZ-74 in man (within two years of the reported synthesis in about 1959) and had carried out the most extensive clinical studies ever conducted, involving at least 160 trials in human volunteers. He presented two separate reports in 1965, to two very different audiences. To the psychotherapeutic audience there was a strong emphasis made of the psycholytic virtues to be found in CZ-74, including its very short duration and the positive nature of the experience. The sessions are called âoverwhelming and ecstaticâ with the âelimination of the hangover of LSDâor any pathological after-effectsâeven with dosages of up to 40 milligrams.â The plaudits continued: âThus, this drug must be considered to be particularly safe and suited for ambulant psycholytic treatment and use by psychiatrists in their practices.â Almost everything was positive.

However, in addressing a neurosciences conference, also in 1965, and referring to the same studies and the same experimental population, he reported some pretty heavy duty neuropharmacological negatives. âIn all sessions there were disturbance of body image, illusions, pseudo-hallucinations and hallucinations. In 50% of [the] cases, motor restlessness, aphasia, loss of concentration and temporal and special disorientation could be clearly observed. In 25% of the cases there was loss of impetus, derealization and acoustic hallucinations. More rarely and only with the highest doses did extreme psychotic symptoms occur, with increased volubility, depersonalization, cosmic-mystic experiences, delirium, schizophrenic behavior with catatonic fits and temporary paranoia.â Almost everything was negative.

At a banquet associated with an international conference on the study of consciousness, held in GÃ¶ttingen a few years ago, Alice and I had the pleasure of sitting at the table with Hanscarl Leuner and his wife. He thanked me for inventing 2C-D which he and his students had been exploring as an adjunct to psychotherapy. They had renamed it, initially DMM-PEA and then LE-25, and had apparently explored it at dosages that reached into the hundreds of milligrams. In PiHKAL, I had offered an effective range for this drug of from 20 to 60 milligrams. It would seem that in his later years, Dr. Leuner chose to move from the psycholytic camp over to the psychedelic camp.

One final comment. When you read a paper or listen to a lecture offered by a researcher of impeccable qualifications, take a moment to look about you to see who is along side you in the audience that is being addressed. Who else is reading his paper? Who else is hearing his lecture? How might the presentation be tailored to fit the interests of the recipients? The identification and recognition of your neighbors should play a role in your evaluation and acceptance of the presentation.

**4-Hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-DET** , **CZ-74** , and **Ethocin** ) is a lesser-known synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class that produces [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) -like [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [adminstered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . 4-HO-DET is a close structural and functional analog of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) (4-HO-DMT), the principal psychoactive component in [magic mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magic_mushrooms) . It is notable for sharing many of its core features while retaining subtle variations in its duration, visual, cognitive and bodily effects.

This compound was first discovered in the late 1950s by [Albert Hofmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Hofmann) and Franz Troxler in their investigation of various [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) compounds that were structurally and chemically related to the principle active components he isolated from [magic mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magic_mushrooms) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) ( **4-PO-DMT** ) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( **4-HO-DMT** ). The substance was used together with its phosphoryloxy-analog [4-PO-DET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-PO-DET) in human clinical trials in the 1960s by the German researchers Hanscarl Leuner and G. Baer.

Since its inception, 4-HO-DET has remained relatively uncommon and has very little documentation of human usage, with the majority of [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) users preferring more traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) like the [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) and [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) in [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) , or more recently, [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) . Today, it is either used as a recreational substance or an [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) , has no documentation of being sold on the streets and is primarily acquired through the use of online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DET, or 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DET is substituted at R 4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains two ethyl chains bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone ( [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) ).

4-HO-DET is the lower homolog of [4-AcO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DET) , the N-substituted diethyl homolog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( **psilocin** ) and the 4-hydroxy analog of [DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DET) .

## Pharmacology

As with its structurally related tryptamines, 4-HO-DET principally acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) , through which it exerts its psychedelic effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain an object of scientific elucidation.

## Subjective effects

In comparison to other isolated synthetic [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) compounds such as [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) and [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) , 4-HO-DET has been reported as being similar in terms of its visual, cognitive and physical effects, albeit with a slightly longer duration, less in the way of bodily effects, and more "synthetic" or "algorithmic"-style visuals.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [2C-T-7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-T-7) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, mostly synthetic in style, unstructured in organization, dimly lit and monotone in scheme, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equally rounded and angular in corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. They have a notably "synthetic" feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry over [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-DET use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-DET is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried 4-HO-DET suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-DET is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-DET is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-DET presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-DET all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-DET. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-HO-DET*

4-HO-DET, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine as well as ethocin or CZ-74, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It is taken orally.
The drug acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor among others. It produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. 4-HO-DET is closely structurally related to other psychedelic tryptamines such as psilocin, diethyltryptamine (DET), and 4-HO-MET. Ethocybin (4-PO-DET; CEY-19) and 4-AcO-DET are assumed to act as prodrugs of 4-HO-DET.
4-HO-DET was first described in the literature by 1963. It was developed at Sandoz by Albert Hofmann and colleagues. The drug was studied in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy by Hanscarl Leuner and colleagues in the 1960s. Later, it was described further by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). 4-HO-DET was encountered as a novel designer drug in 2005.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin variably lists the dose range of 4-HO-DET as 10 to 25 mg orally, either as 4-HO-DET itself or as presumed prodrugs like ethocybin (4-PO-DET) or 4-AcO-DET, and its duration as 2 to 6 hours. Threshold effects are said to occur at doses of 5 to 15 mg, whereas loss of contact with reality is said to occur at doses over 30 mg. However, strong effects have also been reported at a dose of 15 mg of ethocybin. A typical dose estimate has been reported to be around 17.5 mg. The onset of 4-HO-DET is described as being around 30 to 45 minutes.
The drug has been reported to be very similar to psilocin and psilocybin in its qualitative effects but to be somewhat shorter in duration, for instance as short as 2 to 3 hours. The effects of 4-HO-DET, either as 4-HO-DET itself or as presumed prodrugs, have been reported to include closed-eye visuals, open-eye visuals such as fire light turning into bursts of color, potential for intense psychedelic visuals, auditory hallucinations, time dilation, temporal and spatial disorientation, body image disturbance, musical immersion, derealization, ego death, feeling like one has ceased to exist, feelings of oneness with the universe or reality, ineffability, "sparkly-ness", powerful emotions including feelings of intense love, peace, acceptance, awe, reverence, and joy, feelings of sadness, uncomfortableness, and feeling overwhelmed.
Other effects included feeling intoxicated, sedation, restlessness, loss of language ability, impaired concentration, compulsion to talk and interact with others, and lack of erotic feelings. At very high doses, effects including temporary psychosis, depersonalization, mystical experiences, delirium, schizophrenia-like behavior, catatonia, and paranoia have been found to occur. Physical effects have been reported to include stomach and abdominal discomfort, appetite loss, jaw tightening, body tremors, motor incoordination, body disturbance, diuretic effects, and increased blood pressure.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-DET acts as a potent non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors. It may also act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with low affinity but moderate potency. The drug showed no significant activity at various other assessed targets, including adrenergic receptors (α2A-, α2B, α2C), dopamine receptors (D2–D5), muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M4), and the dopamine transporter (DAT).
It induces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency for inducing the head-twitch response in mice is approximately 2-fold lower than that of psilocin.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DET, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-diethyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine. It is the 4-hydroxy derivative of N,N-diethyltryptamine (DET) and is a close analogue of psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine; 4-HO-DMT).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-DET has been described.

### Analogues

4-HO-DET is the N,N-diethyl analogue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT). Other analogues of 4-HO-DET include diethyltryptamine (DET), 5-MeO-DET, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-EPT, and 5-HO-DET, among others. The acetate ester of 4-HO-DET is known as 4-AcO-DET and the phosphate ester is known as ethocybin (4-PO-DET or CEY-19). These compounds are assumed to be prodrugs of 4-HO-DET, as has been shown with the acetate and phosphate esters of other methylated tryptamines such as psilocin (e.g., psilocybin (4-PO-DMT) and 4-AcO-DMT).

## History

4-HO-DET was first described in the literature by 1963. It was developed by Albert Hofmann and Franz Troxler at Sandoz in the 1950s and went by the developmental code name CZ-74. Along with its presumed prodrug ethocybin (4-PO-DET; CEY-19), 4-HO-DET was one of the earliest structurally modified or synthetic psychedelic tryptamines to be developed. It was used along with ethocybin in clinical studies of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy by the German researchers Hanscarl Leuner and Gerhard Baer in the 1960s. The drug was synthesized and studied, along with many other 4-hydroxytryptamines, by David Repke and colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. It was later additionally described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). 4-HO-DET was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2005.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market".

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-HO-DET as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Nov 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:733 listed as 4-hydroxi-N,N-diethyltryptamin (4-HO-DET), making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United States

4-HO-DET is unscheduled in the United States, but purchase, sale, or possession for human consumption could be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act.

## Research

4-HO-DET, under the code name CZ-74 and along with ethocybin (CEY-19), has been studied in psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.
