Hey guys, i was just wondering if any of you here have ever tried recreational dosing of diphenhydramine (sleep aid)?  I find that if you take just the right amount (anywhere from 50-200 mg) that you can have a very strangely entertaining trip.  


Also, i find that if you dose DXM beforehand, and then dose Diphen. once the DXM kicks in, the resulting synergy is very very fun.  It seems to take on a 'fruity jello' essence...  i dont know, thats the only analogy i can muster.


Anyone with experience with Diphen?

Diphenhydramine is noted to be the same as dimenhydrinate (sleep aid, antimimetic, cure motion sickness, allergies, fever...a cure all?dramamine) but twice as strong, stronger peak, and hits you harder when it kicks in. I find personally, that its the opposite, dramamine hits me like a ton of bricks while this stuff isn't very noteable, and takes MUCH MUCH longer to kick in, with it being more of a sleepy, talk to people with your eyes closed because you think their there. Not much different from dimenhydrinate (dramamine) except I think dramamine kicks in sooner, harder, and much more hallucinations.


Benadryl is a common source of diphenhydramine. For some reason dramamine is much more popular. The dosing on diphen is much lower then dimen though.

High doses (3rd/4th plateau) of DXM should be avoided when you're taking it in combination with anticholinergics.

i can never take alot of dramamine without passing out...no matter how hard i try.....

as for mixing with dxm, ive only had bottles of cough syrup which was fun aside from all the sugar in my stomach and vomiting......i wouldnt mind trying dxm in its pure powder form...i imagine is it like a ketamine disassosiative high?

from the reports ive read, i wouldnt say dxm is like ketamine.. ketamine is probly more visual and powerful, am i right? dxm for me made me feel like i was in water and i only got a few visuals (slight patters probly from the pot).. ketamine reports usually talk about hallucinations


ive done diphenhydramine.. and the recreational dose is 200 to 500 (i did 250, i read papers and cd cases and websites and saw people eating and a professor handed a peice of paper to me, all of these were hallucinations), but you only realize you saw visuals once you snap out of...ill call it underconsiousness, where it seems parts of your mind are asleep and other parts are consious, enabling you to get dreamlike hallucinations


after a while the urge to sleep is just too great however.. 50mg is the dose of diphen. for sleeping pills (sominex) or 25mg (for benadryl)


i noticed a similar after affect as morning glory seeds, where the day after (and for several weeks) everything was much more colorful and beautiful and subjectively seen (especially the trees).. but this hasnt happened to my other friend who took it.. but he hasnt tried morning glories yet either


negative after affects persist for about a week and consist of little spots of vision turning a diff shade, as if you look at a bright light for a second at that spot so it turns green or blue or red or another color, but there really was no light

Overdosing on anticholinergics isn't psychedelic in the sightest.


It's not even really worth doing more than one or two times. The novelty of having true hallucinations is cool, but there are so many better things to be doing with your time / mind.

"ketamine is more visual"-- no such thing. dissociative visuals aren't actual visuals, shit looks way different, you may hallucinate all kinds of crazy things, but there's no swirling/morphing/patterns/or trails. I took 30 benadryls one time and did have an interesting trip. Not what I expected a antichlorogenic trip to be like. I never did any of the crazy shhit you hear about people doing on datura or whatever but I actually got some major  swirls, not like like the watery flow most psychedelics give but a jerky motion. I was outside at night but it kept looking like it was daylight. I felt all wierd and saw flying bubbles and a big dancing ameoba like thing in my vision. Sounds kinda cool but it really was nothing that spectacular, it was real wierd. Everytime a car would pass me I'd get a rush of fear even if I knew where I was in relation to the car and even if I tried to prep myself the same would happen everytime. I would do it again, but I really have never been in the mood to do so. The experience wasn't anything too crazy but I'm a little apprehensive to take an antichlorogen even if I've already done it. I would love to try mixing a bunch of diphenhydramine with a bunch of dxm.


Why is it bad to mix antichlorogens with higher end doses of dxm? Is it just cuz of potentiation, loss of reality, or medical reasons, personal exp, good chance of a severe negative or psychotic reaction?

It wouldnt really matter dude because there are no restrictions placed on it whatsoever.


It would be like you getting tested and they find out you took some Ibuprofen or something like that haha.


Watch out though dude, dont take too much.  Never start out with more than 100mg

Ketamine and DXM are very different drugs, even though they are under the same cathegory we all know, dissociative anesthetics. You can have OEV's with Ketamine, something that isn't possible DXM. Also Ketamine has a tendence to totally imobilize you, when you hit the hole. You won't encounter any "Hole" on DXM that will totally imobilize you and transfer you to an alternate reality. Also Ketamine VISUALS (yes they are visuals) are of a higher quality than DXM visuals imo. As for the combo of anticolinergics & dissociative anesthetics, you would get totally fucked up mentally, but at least you won't be able to hurt yourself at high doses (i.e. stumble over things, pick up sharp items and so on...) you will stay more put...

Yes, everyone's different, I have OEV's & CEV's on DXM, also with the classic "swirling/morphing" of things.. I don't understand why people are arguing over wether or not something will induce OEV's/CEV's/visuals, whatever.. It's pretty much personal.

"With DXM, hallucinations are only really noticeable in a dark room with eyes shut (of course, if the room is totally pitch black, then it doesn’t make a difference whether your eyes are open or not.) These are known as CEVs, or closed eye visual hallucinations. "


You cannot have OEV's on DXM, period. Visual disturbances, yes. Increased brightness/contrast yes. Hallucinations/visual patterns, NO. But ok, if you say so. About the morphin, hell yeah... but on CEV's.

I am sorry if I offended you man, it's just that the only other preson I've heard about having OEV's on DXM said he was running around being chased by his friend that turned into a monster... I'll read all the reports on erowid and bluelight, I might be wrong. It just sounds highly unrealistic. If only we had the power to add propreties of choice to a drug that dosn't have them...

Please read up on the differences between visuals and hallucinations.. Seeing a person change into a monster is certainly not somekind of a random "visual", that's more of a full-blown hallucination, sorry.


DXM, without a doubt, produces OEV's and CEV's for me.

Consider yourself lucky dude, because neither I nor my many friends who have/still do DXM ever have full blown OEV.  I can have very good CEV's, but never open eye.


There is one girl i know who is a daily DXM user (upwards of 250 everyday for the past year and a half) who says that DXM's OEV's are better than dropping 2-3 hits of VERY potent acid.   Nobody likes her.  


So yeah dude, be aware that you are indeed very lucky to experience OEV's on DXM.

250mg daily and OEVs?  The first true OEV I got from DXM besides things seeming really far away and then seeming really close to my face was on an upwards of 900mg.  250mg of DXM feels like rubbery speed to me.  I hate speed, so I never take less than 400mg.  Even then I feel like I'm wasting the DXM since 600-750mg is usually my normal dose.  That's just me, though.  Peace.

DXM is just as visual as any other dissociative be it ketamine or pcp. Yeah they all have different dosages/effects. It's like comparing 2c's, they're all visual, some you need to take more than others to reach the same amount of visuals. IMO the great thing about dissociatives and I find this to be true with most people who are into them is that they lack the anxiety producing mental/physacle effectz. In otherwords taking too much will put me under/fully anesthtize me rather than torture my brain.


I guess there are visuals tho, just not typical ones. I remember after a drank 1.5grams dxm in a shot of rum everything looked like it was covered in bright white crystals, it was pretty crazy and I've never seen anything like that on any other dissociative, unfortunatly I black out or pass out(can't remember) my strong dxm trips. Same happens when I boot Ketamine, I can remember getting real fucked up and everything looks real trippy, the world dissolves into a mess of colors feeling and then I come out of it which kinda sux cuz I feel like I missed the best part. PCP on the other hand has shown me all kinds of crazy shit mentally,physacly,and visually it's the most impressive of all them and I don't black out altho I know people who have everyone is diffrent. There are some fun things dust can do. After I come down a bit I like to walk around in the dark(carefully). I remember I was sleeping over at my friend's apartment and everything was real dark. I felt like I could kinda see a little bit from the electronic lights and whatnot. It was amazing, suddenly her tiny ass apartment became the gigantic maze of rooms and hallways. I explored this new dark palace for what seemed like hours. I must have been walking in some type of circles cuz I never bumped into anything. I wasn't really high so it's not like this was my typical dust universe hallucinations. It was cool.

Personally, I don't have much experience with Drama trippin, I've done it a few times and each time I did it, I tripped my balls off..... literally. My friend once took 54 Dramamine. I am surprised he lived through that. Dramamine is definetly an insane drug, but also a very dangerous drug with the potential to kill. Take care of your mind.

don't take this as me being bitchy, but i just do not understand why people do that shit.  why on earth would you want to willingly overdose on a sleep aid, basically putting your brain to sleep but keeping your body awake?  the chances of blacking out and remembering little to nothing of the experience is terribly high, and the rariations in how people react to diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate are so extreme and unpredictable.  


i've babysat several dram/benadryl/etc. trips, and i would never ever EVER do that to myself.  i've seen everything from projectile vomiting (and i mean vomiting that could have won distance medals in the olympics) to people buying imaginary drugs from imaginary people in imaginary places.  almost everyone i've tripsat for (and the doses varied from as low as 6 pills to as many as 24) remembered nothing that they did while they were 'tripping'.  from what i've seen, these drugs are only useful for feeding to people so the rest of the people who aren't tripping can watch and be amused.  


but seriously, these are drugs meant to put a person to sleep.  i take 100-150mg of diphenhydramine at night to put me to sleep (and that's a high dose, but i have terrible insomnia and over several years i've gone from 25mg to this dose), and if i take it and stay up for a while, i get dizzy and absolutely retarded, to a point where my memory span is under a minute long and talking is virtually impossible; i forget what i'm saying halfway through a thought.  and it's not a pleasant feeling by any means; i'm dizzy and stumbly and stupid.  i don't even see how it could be considered a 'high' unless you consider any state outside of your default state to be a high.  being on higher doses of these drugs can certainly prove to be dangerous; i'm not sure about what they do to the body, but if you're not watched every minute, it's not at ALL unlikely that you'll just wander off, thinking you're somewhere you're not, thinking you're with people that aren't there, etc.  i have had to, on more than one occasion, literally follow people so closely that i might as well have been handcuffed to them, just to keep them from falling down stairs, walking into traffic, falling off a balcony, because they had NO IDEA where they were or what they were doing.  out of all the trips i've been the babysitter for, only maybe 10% of them, if that, involved situations in which the person had any connection with reality. 


maybe your experiences have never been like that, and if so, you're lucky and you're in a definite minority.  i don't mean to condemn you; what you do with your body is your business, and as long as you don't infringe upon the rights of anyone else, you can do whatever you want.  i'm sure the drugs i do and the things i do on them would bother some people, too.  but i've just always been completely in awe and disbelief of this type of drug use because of what i've seen over and over again.


and i'll shut up now, because in the end, nothing i've said here matters to anyone but me.

My experience differs.  My dissociative experiences have been confined to ketamine, DXM, and nitrous oxide.

p.s. - I think I prefer ether to ketamine for the same purposes

Well, as DXM metabolizes into DXO, and as it has been found that in experimental models high doses of DXO can induce "vivid auditory and visual hallucinations, often of religious or death-related content" ([Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Antagonist Dextrorphan in Patients With Acute Stroke](http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/26/2/254)) it would not seem that unlikely that some individuals might find DXM to produce said phenomena.  Furthermore, Wolfe and Caravati's excellent paper [Massive Dextromethorphan Ingestion and Abuse](http://www.dextroverse.org/Archives/Massive_DXM_Ingestion_and_Abuse.pdf) lists "tactile hallucinations," "visual hallucinations," and "auditory hallucinations" *in addition to* "visual disturbances" as "Psychological Symptoms of Dextromethorphan Intoxication."

The reason that I experimented with diphenhydramine was because of interest in the role of anticholinergics in traditional shamanc systems, Hinduism, Buddhism, and the European witch cults.

when i tried diphenhydramine i fell asleep, period.  i did get some auditory halluciations, like someone calling my name but noone did but that was it.


as far as dxm, i have MUCH experience with it.  more so than anyone I know or have met, and i have had wilder visuals on dxm than acid or mushrooms.  I saw the floor of my room wave like an ocean, harder and faster than ive ever seen on any hallucenogen.

I've never used diphenhydramine in high doses, but just due to things i've read about the experiences, i would stick to other drugs if i were you.


The only diphenhydramine and DXM combo i use is a small dose of the benadryl to kill the itch, and i do really enjoy DXM.

Dramine is a good drug if used responsibly. I dont really endorse taking high doses of the stuff but I guess that kids will do this regardless. I do not approve of ketamine usage in humans though.

If considered in terms of total use worldwide, ketamine is uson humans far more often than "rarely."

If I were to give a shot into the wind, I'd have to say that Diphenhydramine & analogs have an extremely higher brain and psychologically damaging potential than ketamine.. Not to mention the sexy perma-HPPD anticholinergenics tend to leave behind.

Everyone on here seems to have a weariness and pretty profound respect for Datura and her anticholinergens. In theory, a powerful enough dose of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrate should produce an anticholergenic Delerium quite comparable to a lighter Datura dose.


It strikes me as bizarre that, if we all have such careful esteem for Datura, so many people happy consume whole packages of dramamine, gravol or other OTC anticholins... 


Aren't deleriants generally agreed to be of little recreational worth and primarily just predisposed to leading to very difficult and sometimes scarring experiences when taken in large recreational dosages?

**dramamine worth to whom?**


----- hmm... anticholinergenics tend to boost HPPD? that could explain some things heh


 From what I've gathered by reports of anticholin HPPD, they're not like normal HPPD. Psychedelics tend to cause a "ripple" effect into everyday life with trail & etc that can fade into the distance over time and not really be much of a bother. 

 On the contrary, with delerients and their hard hallucinogenic properties, they tend to PERManently burn something into your brain that looks like HPPD. For example, I heard of one mod on a forum who explained that after binging for weeks on dramamine, his rocking chair shakes from side to side in his peripheral vision, and driving is very hard to concentrate on because of interfering spots and "things being there" in his vision when they shouldn't. Deleriants are not like typical hallucinogens in that what you see is real, so it's of my expert opinion that the HPPD is real and really indents your brain.


 In my *very personal* opinion, traditional psychedelics 'enhance' your senses by not relying on the left-brain analysis and just going on what you **feel**. I believe that the trails we experience is a result of our visual senses confirming what we feel just happened, thus it lags behind as if a separate entity.

 On the other hand, delerients are the counter-productive enemy of perception. They close off our feelings and instead boost our left brain, as if we were dreaming. Random things pop up in reality that make us think that it’s a dream so real that we’re living in it; these things happen that our brains make up completely, but our bodies are involved. So in this area, the HPPD resulting is not a result of enhanced feeling of our environment, but visual delusions overlaying our real world experience. If that made any sense..


----- It strikes me as bizarre that, if we all have such careful esteem for Datura, so many people happy consume whole packages of dramamine, gravol or other OTC anticholins... 


You find that bizarre? I’ve been around a lot of kids who at one moment think DXM is the best substance ever created, but the next they stumble across mushrooms or a ‘real’ drug and suddenly that’s their favorite. This is not surprising, to say the least. OTC drugs, no matter their effects, will be gobbled up by altered state-starved kids who are subjected to a horrible society. It’s simply all about the availability, not the experience.

I saw a girl on Montel Williams who had been in a coma for two weeks after ketamine usage. I dont think it had been taken in conjunction with other drugs either, possibly some alcohol. When I see ketamine I think, that looks odd. Maybe a drug that looks like that is more suited to animals?

Yes there are.   Among them: HPPD, behavioral toxicity (i.e., doing potentially lethally stupid shit while high), and death by overdose.  While I think anticholinergics can be powerful tools for the shamanically inclined, they are most definitely NOT toys, and should not be used carelessly.  I tend to recommend that most drug users stay the fuck away from them, and that those who find they can't resist their curiosity experiment sparingly and consciously.


If you're going to be using these drugs, I recommend that you invest in a good supply of cholinergic precursors (lecithin or DMAE are my favorites; YMMV) and always have a sitter on hand.


Happy travels.

Anticholinergics are insidiously seductive drugs.  They allow you to explore something very like a lucid dream state, to close your eyes and be immersed in a realistic dream-world with which you can interact.  They even allow dream and reality to blend into one.  Nothing else does that, at least not for me.  This makes them fascinating and attractive.  They're very Lovecraftian - *dissolve ye boundaries between ye spheres* - or something like that.


Trouble is, they are so uncomfortable and dangerous, and you have to treat them with the utmost care.  I've used various anticholinergics, and have come to feel a healthy fear of them.  I look upon diphenhydramine pills rather like a very, very hot chili pepper that I'm going to bite into.


Anticholinergics are the only drugs that led me to call emergency services.  Alone on 600 mg diphenhydramine and 180 mg DXM, I thought I was having a heart attack.  I called emergency, the ambulance came, and I was taken to hospital.  In fact, I'd had a panic attack, and an ECG showed that my heart was fine apart from sinus tachycardia (normal with anticholinergics and not dangerous except if extreme).


I did exactly the same thing two weeks later.  Same doses of the same drugs, same emergency call, same result.  Stupid.  Waste of my time and of the time of the emergency services.


Why did I do it again?  Because, the first time, I discovered that I could look at at picture in a book, and see it as though it were a window into another 3-d world.  The second time, I wanted to look at the illustrations in Jung's alchemical works, and enter through the images into the alchemical dream-world.  I ended up in a hospital waiting room all night.  Seduced, not by the promise of pleasure, but by the promise of knowledge, of new worlds open to exploration.  And, despite being jilted like this, I still believe in that promise and may one day, when properly prepared, make another attempt.


Sorcerer's apprentice, anyone?  Calling out forces which one cannot control...

Wow, you don't see many people mention Lovecraft these days...


I feel the same about diphenhydramine and it's being 'Lovecraftian'.

well I'va been throughdramamine (dimenhydrinate) wich is a "sedative anticholinergic anti-nausea"

suggested hallucinogenic dosage on erowid.org was 8 to15 pills

Me and a friend of mine tried 10 pills with very little results (exepting heavy sedation)...so I tried 20 pills, doubling dose isn't wise, I know, that's exactly how I learnt this rule because I almost died and still didn't get any effects exepting very heavy sedation, irregular heart beat (I thought my heart almowas going to stop, but Iwas lucky and didn't die). Oh, yess also, very fun because my blood wasn't circulating well: my extremities did turn blue (well, fingers were blue and....my balls turned brown ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ). I had to take a hot bath to produce vasodilatation so things came back to normal on the sixth hour.

My friend had different results as he would beok with this stuff, so he did getacute delirium from 25 pills (at least) and with 30 his heart almost stopped too.

Here's how washis trip: he would want to say something, but he would say something completely different without noticing it, and as I answer his unwanted question he would hear something completely different from what I said....let me give you a few exemples:


exemple one:

me (sober): were do you go for vacations?

him (on 25 pills): well, my grandmother said...

me: what the fuck are you telling lool ?

him: yes, don't you know how to make podridge, don't you?


exemple two:

him (answering to a question I didn't even asked): no, horses arn't here

me: ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) (feeling our discussion won't ever lead anywhere)

him: because the king is gone now you know hmfrr, why do you look at me this way, did I say something I shouldn't?

me:![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 


exemple three:

him: it's late, I think I'm going back to my home now

me: you'reat your home now, no urge you know ![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) ...


and so on and so on....


he also spent great time to make cofee to an invisible woman he thought I was talking with..."she asked for cofee" he said when I asked if he was making coffee for him or for me...


he did speak to many invisible persons during the night (he wouldn't even believe me as I was telling him these people weren't real)...I remember him closing slowly a door for 15 minutes not to wake up 3 imaginary people sleeping in his bed...so fun but so strange as he didn't realize he was tripping and was so serious...yes, that's delirium.


the trip isn't euphoric at all, very very sedative, very dangerous for heart and blood circulation, and on the next day you don't remember much of how you spent your night...the only fun thing (if this is "fun") is the next day, when people tell you how psychotic like you've been acting, then you can think "well I was really fucked up"...to bad you didn't enjoy it as you were tripping and too bad you don'treally remember now.


I think the substance you want to try is very similar(sedativeanticholinergic pills right?... with a very similar name: dramamine/dimenhydrinate/diphenhydramine...looks like the same familly of compound if not the same)...my advice: don't (not fun and very dangerous)...much better drugs around.

Anticholinergics are not generally known for leaving good memory intact - they induce a delirious state, after all.  Hope that dose is going smoothly for you.  I find DPH (diphenhydramine) too uncomfortable even at sub-delirious doses due to the odd nervous tingle / "paradoxical stimulation" effect DPH can have at higher doses, and plenty of TRs scared me away from much interest in a higher dose anyway.


I do use DPH regularly at much lower doses as everything from allergy/sinus medication to a sleep aid.  Many people find that, if the drowsiness of 100-200mg doses isn't too much to handle, DPH can also enhance orgasms in both genders and help with 'stamina issues' for guys.  YMMV of course.

notebook, 1 full water bottle, warm sweater; stay mildly active.


i don't do diphenhydramine anymore. high doses would leave my vision and hearing altered/impaired for a day afterward. horrible body load with like only one hour of visuals. also risk of blackout.


one tip: eat your pills, and then stash them somewhere hard for you to reach. redosing won't get the visuals to comeback after they leave, only make you crazier. it's scary to have furniture speak to you.

-3 50 am- Just took 1200mg of diphenhydramine, Feeling excited =)

-4 30 am- Got up, moved around a bit, normally dont feel anything yet, but on todays trip I could swear i heard a train, then while typing this i can hear a baby... I am home alone, I must reserch the come up and see if its faster on high doese, in the morning that is. 

-4 38 am- Well, body is extremly heavy, randomly talking outloud, hah. Right now trying to decide if I want to go smoke my last bowl or not, or would it be better tomorrow? Ill write again after my desicion and or procces of smoking.

I hope zellpheo is ok, that is way tooo much to be doing.

My friend had gotten dropped off at her house, thats when she started convulsing. She was in pretty bad shape the month after it happened, really frail, like a wisp of her former self. While she was in the hospital a friend of hers visited and messaged me, I thought it was someone else as I was still hallucinating hardcore, and I apparently laughed at her then said goodbye. It was quite the fucked up night, took her a good 2-3 months to recover fully from it. The trip was completely fucked, before she went home we kept thinking we had a full conversation, so we'd say something and the other would just be like "what?" This was us for a good hour. When she was in the hospital I started seeing spiders everywhere so I just passed out.

Thats why I never touch diph anymore, its such a sketchy drug. Almost got my good friend killed ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png).

I'm going to take the fact that he didn't finish the report as an indicator that his DPH "trip" didn't turn out well. 1.2 grams sounds awful. I took 300mgs once and hated it so I went to sleep, I can't imagine how horrible a dose like that would be.

Well.... Where do I begain. First off, I made it through the night perfectly well, no probelms health wise that is =)


Second off, I* do not reccommend ever doing a dose that size. Ever.


Thank you all for taking care and interest in my post, you are all right a dose that size is not a smart idea, So I do not advocate doing a size above 500mg, ever.


Third, I do not remember much, Will attempt to right the report later when I have time, there were many spiders, and my shoe was a scorpian...Yikes!!!

Luckly I passed out during the comedown, so that was good. Still shaking a bit though, and some minor side effects. The Trip its self was amazing, CEV were spectaculur, even though it was all a dilision. I even had some OEV, like the spiders and such, At points I didnt know which way was up...Had some real life conversiasions with people on my phone as well which I do not remember, I have a new setting for my phone now, called "diph" setting hah. Over all this has been a good learning experiance, Granted me new respect for the drug, and wisdom above all... Don't mess around with this Drug, it can Fuck you up ^.^

I don't think diphenhydramine is *that* dangerous physically. In German drug forums you'll find many trip reports with doses >1000mg. One guy did 1g several times, even combined with alcohol. Though, I don't get the idea of these "trips". You won't remember very much and do stupid things you might regret later. A reasonable dose is probably 200-500mg diphenhydramine (roughly equals to 400-1000mg dimenhydrinate).


And DPH can really enhance a DXM trip. Even 100mg add nice visuals and hallucinations.

Diphen is most definitely dangerous at high doses. It can - and is - fatal on occasion. Of course there are people who are fine. But potential death and all but guaranteed delerium is a pretty high risk to take for what is a pretty vile experience for most. I've only done it once and that was accidental cos I had no idea that diphen did anything other than send you to sleep at the time. It was horrific for me and that seems to be far and away the most common experience of the stuff. No idea about low dose though - just made me drowsy.

would u get any sort of minor hallucinations from a dose like 200mg maybe 250mg? i wouldnt want to put myself through hell of a higher dose, but although it sounds terrifying, im also very interested by it all, and would like to exp light 'real' hallucinations, would 250mg cause any delerium or just make me tired as fuck and fall asleep?


done high doses of real psychs like acid, 2c's etc but i know this is COMPLETELY different.


Any advice appriciated ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

From 250mg I have experienced delerium. I would take it and lay in my bed, drifting in and out of delerium.


I usually dosed around 400mg and this produced significant delerium which I found fascinating. I found it actually prevented sleep, but created the illusion of sleep once I went over 150mg. My last, and highest dose was 800mg and I wish I'd never gone that high. I was very worried for my life and I was getting shocks in my brain and had to concentrate very hard to breathe. However, due to the delerium I would forget about this and periodically snapped out of the delerium gasping for air.


Most of the 'real' hallucinations I experienced were mainly of an auditory nature. The visual hallucinations were of spiders and other such things. It becomes very hard to distinguish between the episodes of delerium and reality. Diphenhydramine also feels utterly horrible on the body. If you're going to explore it then don't go too high. Take 250-300mg and lay down in the dark. You will be able to explore the effects and snap out of them periodically. It's better to dip your toes with this than take the risk and dive fully in.

For a while I was working on a doxylamine FAQ with somebody but we abandoned the project once we realized this is not really a drug but an illness. 


In any case I would like to see more extensive documentation on anticholinergic syndrome and its (very few) positive effects.

ive tripped on DPH twice... i think i took 400mg both times... maybe 450 the second time.

the first time was kinda fun, i was with my friend and we were just buggin out and laughing the whole time, then i went home and kept thinking my phone was floating away while i was trying to sleep, then i'd reach out to grab it and i would see it sitting on the table next to my bed. and that just kept happening over and over.

and i saw all kinds of spiderwebs all over the ceiling.

and at one point i looked towards the wall in my room and it turned into a window and i could see the street outside my house.


that was interesting, it wasnt uncomfortable, just sort of strange. but not a bad experience


i tried again, and this time i was at my friend's house, it was absolutely horrific. i dont remember much, i just know that we tried to play mario party and watching the tv made me sick and i kept seeing spider webs and it was creeping me out so i shut my eyes and curled up on his floor for a couple hours. then i went home and just felt really sick and freaked out for the rest of the day... not fun at all.


never messing with that shit again, not worth it at all.


although i have heard that DPH and DXM can be a nice combo.. never tried it.

^DPH + DXM would probably be about as fun as CCC (chlorpheniramine + DXM)


by that i mean you should seriously reconsider 'nice combo' and think of it as 'quick route to liver failure and possible overdose' due to potentiation and disabling of crucial enzymes that the body uses to clear these drugs out of your system.

I've done DPH more than I have ever needed to, and there's many things i've found/picked up through all this...


1. General consensus from another forum that i frequent is that smoking weed with it actually counteracts the effects of both. personally, I've found it to take the edge off quite a bit (aka ruin the point of delirium) so I guess this is up to you.

2. Most of the doses in this thread are considered really low, the other forum i've been on says that around 700mgs is about where the sweet spot is for a good trip. I've seen spiders and cats and stuff with doses from 400-500, but generally the 200-600mg zone is just a really shitty body load with little-to-no hallucinations.

3. this drug is NOT FUN, it really just makes you feel like shit. seriously.

4. If you have a weak heart, SERIOUSLY DO NOT FUCK WITH DPH. as you have seen from the 900mg girl, she fucked her shit right up.


The attached picture has quite a bit of information regarding this drug. I would say enjoy but... no.

source: 420chan /del/ board


oh yeah, at one point i've taken at least 250mg through 400mg a night for a month. Just... don't. I can't really attribute any negative effects this has had on me directly but I'm pretty sure it has done at least something negative to my mind/body. Best bet is to just stay the fuck away, really...

**Benadryl**


I've done a decent amount of psychedelics and experienced pretty much as intense of trips as you can (not to sound arrogant, I've just had some insanely bad trips), but judging by the trip reports of DPH, it sounds pretty damn interesting imo. So I was gonna try it sometime soon and I was wondering people's opinions on the dosage and what mixing ambien might do?


People seem to do around 500 mgs for a strong trip and that matches with Erowid, but people also seem to make comments about how dangerous it is so I'm kind of asking out of desire to avoid the hospital. I'm healthy with low blood pressure and heart rate, everything is pretty good. In an average healthy person is 500 mgs relatively safe when compared to other street drugs and such and would you recommend doing this dose, less, or even more? I know most people say they wouldn't want to do it again, but it just sounds too interesting for me to not experience at least once.


Oh another thing, what does it feel like while tripping? Is there usually nausea or some sort of discomfort?

You feel pretty dysphoric physically when its coming on.. and you will feel like that the whole time unless you become fully delerious..


Once fully delerious.. the body load, if you will, seems to vanish.. either that or i forget about it being the by the time im not delerious anymore.


Be careful.


You will need a sitter.. but ime, people talking to you / interacting with you will stop the delerium taking over. Think of it like falling asleep.. if there's someone there talking to you, you will not fall asleep.


I have taken nearly a gram before while outside with a pretty big group of friends.. i didn't get delerious atall.. instead.. i felt dysphoric (kinda like i hadnt slept for a long time but without feeling sleepy + major dry mouth) and i had the memory span of about 3 seconds.. no joke.. someone would start talking to me and by the end of the sentence i couldn't remember the beginin.. when i tried.. i had no idea what was just said.

How much do you weigh?


I weigh 140lbs and my first experience (250mg) was very enjoyable, euphoric, and very similar to some psychedelic trips, but after that it all went down hill so i quit doing it.


The body load is a sickening feeling, like you have a stomach virus.  Whatever your going to dose, take it all at once, because redosing just seems to increase body load for me.

diphenhydramine is not a psychedelic, it is a deleriant. large doses are very unpleasant, with severe dysphoria, dry mouth, restlessness, paranoia, and a strong desire to sleep without the ability to, and its also very damaging to ones self. it will cause effects similar ot datura, and you will have no control over yourself and you'll have scary hallucinations that are unable to distinguish from reality. save the benadryl for allergy season.

Yeah after thinking it over maybe this wasn't the right place to post this, but what defines a psychedelic is sort of vague and depends on the user imo. Common psychedelics can cause delirium and it has less to do with the effects than the person and their mindset imo. I do of course understand a high dose of DPH is bound to make me delirious though.


I weigh about 150 or so and I don't currently know anyone that would babysit for me sadly. I'm not worried about mental trauma as I know what I can handle, but there is always the risk of doing something stupid. Maybe I'll just do a lowish dose, idk, but tonight probably isn't the best night to do a high dose cause I could end up with some bad consequences (family around). 


Just out of curiosity, is there anything known to lessen the effects? Like how a lot of people use benzos for shrooms and such, could benzos possibly work here as well?

Get some real drugs. I usually hate when people say that, but eating a bunch of DPH is a pretty lame and desperate attempt to get fucked up. In my humble opinion 8)

It has nothing to do with wanting to "get fucked up", I'm interested in the realistic hallucinations often described. I've had trips where I couldn't tell the difference between reality and hallucination, but it wasn't quite the same. I used to get sleep paralysis a lot and one of the times I was being eaten alive by a shadow creature, causing physical pain (or maybe it was caused by the position I slept in or something, but every nightmare where I was stabbed or bitten woke me up with physical pain that lasted at least a day or two) and the sound of them chewing in my ear. I desire something as realistic as that.


Does anyone else have an opinion on the dose btw?

300mg may or may not be enough to cause delirium.  500 almost certainly would be.  I've met a fair number of people who have tried it, and not a single one who enjoyed it or ever wants to experience it again.  Good luck, I hope you know what you're getting yourself into.


As for safety - 500mg shouldn't be physically dangerous in a healthy person, but the biggest danger by far with deliriants is the stupid shit people *do* while on them.  Make SURE to have a sitter, one who can physically restrain you if need be.


The hallucinations caused by DPH delirium are generally known for being common objects, and hallucinations of friends and family.  There are all sorts of horror stories of people 'tripping' on DPH and thinking they had some horrible argument or falling out with someone close to them, or even that something horrible happened to someone they care about (e.g., hallucinating a phone that rings, and being 'told' by a non-existent doctor that your wife is dead - read a report where that exact scenario happened), then they can't tell what was real and what wasn't after coming down.

I do know what I'm getting myself into and I'm hoping I don't do something stupid, but idk it just sounds too interesting for me to pass up.


In case it is necessary, do you think popping some benzos would help reduce the effects? I'm hoping it'd at least stop me from freaking out, but it might just make it more likely that I do something stupid, idk.


I honestly wish I didn't read the end part of your post, hopefully I can get it out of my mind! lol

It's officially starting to kick in (I took them a while before I posted) and for some reason I just started hiccuping lol

Yeah that was what I was thinking as well, but thought it could help me just lay down and pass out maybe. Any ideas of what could sort of counter the effects if needed for some reason? I was considering maybe smoking a few cigs later even though I don't really smoke usually unless I'm tweaking.


First noticeable effect is that I keep forgetting words that I thought I had already typed. I forget that just cause I'm saying the words in my head doesn't mean I typed them lol.


This probably was a bad idea tbh, but meh. I took some ginger to possibly avoid some of the sick feeling later.. Also the effects keep drastically increasing while I'm typing this.

Yeah, my mistake - used to thinking about tryptamines, not antihistamines ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


  And I also agree - benzos could be dangerous territory with deliriants in terms of increasing your chances of doing stupid shit without realizing how stupid it is at the time.


FWIW, I've taken 300mg of DPH along with plenty of pot before in my younger, less responsible days, and I didn't get any of the crazy lifelike hallucinations - just a fairly uncomfortable body high, a lot of sedation and some very minor visual oddities (I remember staring at my computer speaker on my desk and, while it didn't move or change shape, for some reason it felt like I was staring down from straight above rather than forward from in front of it, and like it was some massive monument rather than a little speaker.  Hard to explain, more an altered interpretation of regular vision than visuals I suppose).

The best way to reduce the effects of DPH is to smoke weed. For whatever reason it seems to bring you down pretty effectively.

Yeah it feels like the effects have stopped increasing somewhat and there isn't anything special yet besides sounds being super loud and silence is really weird, almost like it's too quiet. 


The sick feeling is mostly gone now, but I'm still feeling somewhat uncomfortable and regretting taking any tonight. Without hallucinations it seems like there really isn't anything except the negative effects.

I *still* don't get the appeal behind overdosing on a drug in hopes of experience *one* of the MANY **toxic** consequences, all bad, of anticholinergic OD?


If I tell you that the antidote for what you just did is **Tear Gas**, would you believe me that you are literally poisoning yourself? DPH is actually NOT chiefly even a deliriant. The delirium is the body's cry for help upon realizing that its been severely poisoned.

Yes, look up "anticholinergic toxicity". It is so well-documented that it boggles my mind how some people still imagine it (or datura, etc) to be a somehow "misunderstood" drug.

OP, I've done DPH many, many, many times. I have reduced it to a science. As you can see by my spelling and coherency, I've experienced no ill long-term effects. 


I must warn you that 500mg as a starting dose is asking for trouble. I regularly trip above 700mg well into the 1.2g range, but also as low as 75mg. DPH is a drug with high dysphoria **if you have no tolerance**. The reason most people experience raging tachycardia, horrific nightmare trips and a whole assortment of terrible events is because they dive into the waters before they learn to swim. 


I can answer nearly any question you need to know about the experience itself, dosing, activities to do, etc. 


There is a board on 4 2 0 chan dedicated to Deliriants (not just DPH, but Nutmeg, Datura, etc.)


I recommend starting with a delayed dose of 150 mg. Do 75mg, wait 45 minutes to one hour, then dose 75mg again. 


You might be extremely sensitive to the 75 mg, and if that's the case, don't dose again. But if you are able to handle the discomfort, dose once more. Listen to music. Watch pleasant things. Ensure that you won't be disturbed and that you have no obligations. 


For the first few trips, you simply must get accustomed to the dread. Once you are over the dread, you may dose 300mg at once. Always listen to music on DPH. Never go outside. You will be unfit to be in public. 


I recommend doing any creative activity, even talking aloud or writing your thoughts. 


Don't be another casualty of ignorance. DPH can be enjoyable, but it's an acquired taste and it isn't forgiving in the slightest. You can die if you don't have the tolerance that I do. I can take doses that would literally kill an inexperienced person or send them to the hospital. Not exaggerating.


Most people here don't trip on DPH regularly, but I have and I can guide you in the right direction. You might not be cut out for this, so I can give you safety advice. 


Above all, the safest thing to do is abstain from DPH, of course. But if you want to try it successfully and not have a heart attack, please follow my advice. 


PM me your AIM if you feel like asking any more questions.

I must stress something not known by most people: the negative effects of DPH go away even at high doses once a person becomes accustomed to the drug. Your body can handle it and tachycardia, jumpiness, and dysphoria go away. 


The only thing that doesn't go away is the post trip itch and mucous membrane dryness. If only there were a way to prevent that. Visine works for the eyes but at very high doses, your nose will itch like hell. 


Also be aware that you might experience urinary retention. To make matters worse, you have to stay hydrated during a DPH trip. Don't freak out. You only have this problem at doses higher than you can handle. This is one of the reasons why you should gradually work up to high doses. I can pee at 1.2 grams. I will bet money that you won't be able to and might need a catheter.


P.S: Music sounds GODLY on this at the sweet doses (250-400, 700 and up). Listen to music with pauses and vocals that stand alone at certain parts. 


Between 400 and 700 is a worthless area unfortunately. I don't know why, but this has been noted by others as well.

phew: while tolerance may increase to the dysphoric effects of DPH, the cardiotoxicity, as it were, certainly does not go away. Certainly you've heard of Sedric Lightbury.

The antidote would be nerve gas, that is, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, not tear gas, which are capsaicin agonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors have other legitimate medical uses in non-convulsant doses.


FWIW: to get a real DPH experience you'll need over 600 mg, usually, though it varies depending on body weight.

I hate diphenhydramine. I took it back in high school when I first started having interest in drugs.


Made me feel like I was floating inside my own body, weighed 1000lbs when I walked, and repeatedly had extended conversations with people who weren't there.


Hallucinations, not the fun Lysergic brand either.

Nerve gas and Tear gas were interchangeable last time I checked. When I made the above post, I was thinking of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors like Sarin. Lachrymation is an effect of both those and the capsaicin drugs.

It inhibits muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. These are used in all types of neurotransmission (iirc?) so it basically fucks the brain over.

OP please take my word. delierients like Jimson weed and overdoses of anti-histamines never turn out well. Even if somehow they did they tend to be pretty amnestic. Tons of risk to extremely low chance of benefit.


If someone does decide to do delierients please have a baby sitter so that you are not collecting imaginary ladybugs off of an imaginary spaceship that happens to be realistically in the middle of very solid traffic. Best of luck whatever you decide to do. (more realistically you'd be avoiding disgusting blurry blobs when your baby sitter would need to pull you out of traffic or off a roof.)

Was out of town for a few days at Busch Gardens n whatnot and just read over the replies, but there are too many people to respond to lol. Anyway, I appreciate the information everyone has given and I'll take getting used to it first into consideration (although I think I'll start over 300 mgs since I already did it) if I end up wanting to go through with it.


Again I do realize it isn't the most enjoyable experience, I was actually in the mood for hell tbh cause I was bored and curious. I'm still curious so I will probably end up going through with it eventually, but it won't be for a while if I do and I might dose 300-400ish mgs a few times beforehand. I'm really not looking for an enjoyable experience, it's more like research.


> "sounds being super loud and silence is really weird, almost like it's too quiet." LOL yep fucking diphenhydramine. Excellent drug for fast fowarding tobacco withdrawal or putting you to sleep. Otherwise, it's evil as fuck.

Yeah, I felt like killing someone every time I heard a tap. I can't remember if I tried listening to music or not, but I think I avoided it cause sound didn't seem pleasant.

I've had many experiences with diphenhydramine on varying degrees. I'll give you a quick overview of it.


When I had no tolerance and ingested my first few doses (which consisted of about 4 times in the 200-400mg range), I felt EXTREMELY FUCKING HEAVY; think Goku from DBZ having to carry around those 500lb weights on his limbs when he underwent training. There was one time when I had fallen asleep about 4 hours in and, upon awakening, struggled to get out of bed for about 30 minutes on account of me feeling like I'd weighed a ton. Walking was no easy task, as my feet would drop much faster than I usually could, which felt like I was a rusty robot in need of an oil change, I guess a very stiff sort of robowalk.


Visual effects included the texture of whatever I stared at to constantly change like someone were overlaying some photoshop motion blur effect each 2 frames. Music felt both fucking odd, yet amazing. It wasn't just like hearing the song for the first time.. it was like being exposed to *music itself* for the first time. Sitting in silence is a particularly eerie experience on DPH at the sub-delerious doses as it felt as though at any second something would pop up. At sub doses it usually never progresses more beyond unparalleled fear. 


The times I've had true delerium from dph however are a whole nother ballpark.


800mgs taken 25 minutes before I got on the last bus home at 10:00PM resulted in:


My memory of ever getting off the bus completely missing; You know how dreams always start off mid-way through an event, you don't know or question why you're at a certain place doing something? I just appeared in a raaaaandom neighborhood with my 4 good mates behind me (we were all laughing and joking around, interacting for like 15 minutes), me stopping and asking if they wanted to get food, then their faces suddenly became blank, they vaporized, and the best response I could utter was a very low "hm." and seeing nothing wrong with this at all (you will not have the urge to speak on diph, doing so results in you saying completely off the walls shit to people, real AND imaginary)


Spiders. Multiplying. EVERYWHERE. Scuttling around on the sidewalk in circles. It got so bad I had to fucking run from a certain block because there were at least 1,000 spiders scuttling around (they looked like those soot ball things from Spirited Away).


I would hold my phone to my ear and talk to my mom for 30 minutes, who turned into my girlfriends voice, to my dad's voice, to my teachers voice... only to realized that my phone had no battery in it. 


Usually you'll realize you're on dph sooner or late. And if you don't, you'll end up taking this all in as reality, which can lead to you questioning some of these hallucinations and getting your senses back briefly.


I wasn't so lucky. I twice actually came to the conclusion that I was lucid dreaming the entire time and fell very deeply into my delerium. And when this happens, they can become very complex.


I saw my friends parytying in a red sports car, drinking, passing a blunt, I kept knocking on the window for them to let me in, heard some black dude yell from his window across the street "YO GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM MY CAR", me responding "NAH MY FRIENDS ARE IN HERE", him appearing before my face with 3 Biggie Smalls looking fellas, him pointing a tiny gun at me, patting me down, staring me in the face, saying I can go... me looking back after taking a few steps, realize the car was a fire hydrant, the black dude was a bush, and the house across the street had only boarded up windows. With each hallucination you move further and further away from reality. I did not finally exit my delerious state until 8AM the next morning, only realizing that I was because I'd called my girlfriend, yelled at her for arguing with me for 30 minutes and running away from me in my neighborhood and that I'd be late for school (somehow I ended up back home despite being like 3 miles away) and how I looked for her for like an hour.. only for her to say "wtf are you talking about? I wasn't around your area, I was sleeping this whole time. And today's Sunday", when it hit me that I was just buggin' the whole time and I vaguely remembered something called "Benadryl" having SOMETHING to do with my being loopy.


The most fun thing to do when diph-tripping is to smack the people hallucinations and watch them actually back away from you while half their head is vaporized.. only to have them reappear next to you. That was an hour of fun ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Ah, when you actually transition into the delerious stage, you will no longer feel heavy for some reason. Also, the hangover from diph feels like shit. For a good month or two after extensive use I felt like an emotionless zombie. And I feel that diph tolerance grows exponentially as I very rarely had hallucinations later on in my use, other than shit sliding across the wall.


Popping 25mg-125mg benadryl before bed results in very intriguing dreams, though they usually tend to be "everyday life" sort of dreams with a twist in my case. Mixing benadryl and melatonin (50:50, about 25mg-75mg each) 30 minutes before bed led in extreme dream recall and clarity. You'll be unable to ever achieve actually lucid dreams as you can sort of feel as diph's delerious tinge carries on over into the dreamscape as well. 


For strictly music euphoric purposes I'd say low dose diph and weed make for an extraordinary combination. Any higher and it sounds very dysphoric (regardless whether it is bubblegum pop or not.) Ah, and more times than not you'll hallucinate completely new instruments and parts playing. Good for creative inspiration.


Last thing I'd like to divulge is to be prepared for your first symptoms of HPPD following use. Nothing more severe than visual static, objects sliding and textures changing. But be warned that it can linger for a long time and you may become a tad aggressive for weeks to come (ruined things with my girly bird for a bit there =| )


In all honesty it's not something I'd recommend one to do extensively, high doses in particular. It's intriguing to take on the perception of one who is inflicted with severe dementia or schizophrenia out of curiousity, but its more pleasant effects lay lower. I no longer touch the stuff except at the recommended dosage however. ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I did around 250mg one time to see what it was like. I was talking to people who weren't there, worst part was i had to go to church during it, but i think i went, walked home, and kept talking to people who weren't there and smoking/dropping imaginary cigarettes.

At just 250 mgs? I didn't notice any sort of hallucinations on 300 mgs, but the next day I did question a lot of the shit that happened like convos online etc.

Are there any safer drugs that cause the same sort of delirious effects to allow you to see real life hallucinations like this? I recently read someone talking about one that was also a stimulant and generally more pleasant, but I can't remember what it was. These crazy hallucinations that are even responsive just sound way too interesting to not experience at least once, but if there is a better/safer drug for experiencing them I'm completely up for that as long as I can get my hands on it.


Strange how being tired often allows me to think more clearly, must be the years of sleep deprivation so I'm accustomed to thinking while tired. When I'm awake my mind feels blank and anxiety takes effect :-\

Dude, don't take that shit.  Afterward you will just say "Wow...what a waste of time."  


Just drink a beer or two...that will be much better for you than that crap.


I'm telling you from my experience as I took that junk when I was bored...and datura.   Not so fun, and definitely not worth it!


Not trying to be no buzz kill for you, I'm just lookin out for you.  By no means, it will not send you to a hospital or nothing like that [large amounts of anything is bad for you].


Just don't do it.

IMO you should stay away entirely.


Datura can be alot more dangerous though because an accurate dose is hard to take.

The potency varies from plant to plant and even in different parts of the plant.

This is true. If you'd like to work with Datura/Brugmasia get a plant and grow it for a number of years and slowly develop a relationship with it and learn how potent it is, etc.

Yes, Datura is pretty insane.


While back, I found this interesting flower at my friends house.   I asked him what it was, and he said Angels Trumpet.  I remembered reading something about such flower and seeing its pictures over at erowind.org [sp?].  So without knowing better I broke of 3 "trumpets" and took them to my house.  


I remember going to the car to get them, eating all three, then going back inside to smoke some weed with my friends.  The next thing happens is I wake up in my room feeling shitty.


When I asked what happened last night they said:

-I ate toilet paper...

-Sat on my friends lap and told him to move.

-Pissed in my living room, and when they asked me wtf am i doing i looked over my shoulder and said "What?"


Did some other weird shit, but point being: I shouldn't had ate the flower....

I took 400mg last week, my first time using DPH. I knew that the general consensus on how much you need to trip is 600-700mg, but I definitely had visuals on the dose I took. The was grass growing from my carpet, saw some spiders, saw some animal thing, things kept disappearing when I went to touch them, and while I was drinking from a "bottle of water," it disappeared. Also when I was going to sleep, it would be absolutely silent, and then I would hear one of my friends say something, and I would answer them as if they were there and realize they weren't. It wasn't as frightening as I'd imagined it to be, but then again I didn't do a full dose.

After reading into it more I'm starting to understand what is exactly so dangerous about it, but I'm still curious about experiencing the delirious effects.


Are their drugs that can produce those real hallucinations without working in the same dangerous way? I kind of assume delirious hallucinations like that are always going to be from a somewhat nasty drug, but maybe there is some other way to get them?


Good news is I'm starting to feel less desire to even try this, more interested in just tripping again lol.

So I did like 700 mgs last night... Instead of talking to imaginary people I just imagined myself talking to imaginary people while in reality I was just sitting at my desk with my mouth open. I basically was constantly day dreaming, I thought I got up and had a glass of milk with cookies, but I don't think I ever actually got up. While chatting with people on AIM I kept thinking they sent me a response and I read it and responded and sometimes the conversations were getting pretty long and then I'd snap out of it and notice my chatbox didn't have any of the conversation in it.


The worst part bout the experience was I would randomly jump as if I was on an amp binge and someone snuck up on me, terrible feeling. Surprisingly I didn't really see any hallucinations or even really hear any (or I didn't realize they were fake lol), but my coordination was way off and I kept reaching for stuff and missing it completely and walking sideways and shit. Oh wait I did see a lot of bugs flying around and other stuff, but nothing very impressive.


It's hard to say if some of the day dreams were actually real and I was just hallucinating and forgot I got up. I kept trying to take deep breaths to reduce the panic, but I couldn't breathe properly.

Why am I so dumb? Even though I remember the experience last night being pretty terrible I feel like doing it again cause I missed the main part I was interested in, the real hallucinations. I clearly remember how bad it was and not even caring bout the hallucinations anymore, but yet I still find myself wanting to do it again, must be some sort of retardation.


I was definitely really close and I might have even just slept through them, I just couldn't put up with the level of panic I was feeling so I had to take some xanax and sleep. It was the same sort of panic feeling that used to shoot me awake when I was drifting off to sleep, no idea what it is or why I experience it, but it is oh so terrible.

You know Einstein's definition of insanity? I've been there and understand the compulsion to keep trying. When you lose hope that somehow it could turn out different or devolop an uter revulsion you'll be able to move on.

Reminds me how I scarred my face, was digging around inside with a pair of scissors, it started from just a zit >.< Obsession is bad.


I have a feeling a lot of the strange things I did like that were because of being forced on ADD meds and not being warned about any of the effects they had. Being on them was the main reason my hands and feet turned purple constantly, made me a lot quieter (my teachers even noticed), it was probably also part of the reason I stopped sleeping. I despise people that do this to kids... It wasn't enough that I didn't like a medication the first time cause of side effects, had to try each one at least twice at different doses (staying on each one for a month or more before we went to the doctor again). Eventually I just started getting pissed and refused. Grrr.. Really though so many medications are given out without the patients understanding the effects, it's terrible.


When I was younger I tried to make a song that was about someone obsessed and begging for help, I never realized how much meaning it actually had til now haha.


I really have no idea if I saw hallucinations or not last night, I think I vaguely remember talking to my parents about different things throughout the night and it's unlikely I actually did talk to them. It coulda just been in a dream afterwards though, dunno.

Dude, it sounds kind of like you're having a really negative reaction to your ADD meds (Adderall or Vyvanse?).  That sounds really worrying... I got chills reading it.  You should definitely find some way to let your doctor and parents know what's happening.  You could really be in danger... purple hands and feet is a really bad sign.


Please try to get help for this. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

The stuff you were reading was from when I was in middle school and early high school.


I don't usually have that happen anymore unless I don't take care of myself. It's really not a big deal though, it's just from not eating enough and the environment being slightly cold or w/e. My uncle has the same problem, it's called Raynaud's. My hands used to look like zombie hands almost every day at school and I'd hide them in my pockets or sweatshirt.


And I don't actually know what I was on half the time during middle school, Vyvanse didn't exist and they tried all sorts of crap, but I know it does happen on amphetamines (years later became addicted to them) and I was on adderall for at least a few months back then.


I actually have a picture I took of my hand like a year ago while I was a tweaker with it all purple, it's also like ice cold when it's like that cause they don't really stay warm on their own. Often it would start looking more grey and zombielike.

Oh okay, that makes sense.  As it happens, I have poor circulation in my hands too, always have.  I remember times when it was 85 to 90 degrees outside and I was sitting inside with my hands feeling like ice.  I've never gotten the zombie-hand effect though. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've done diphenhydramine more times than I can count, but I always recommend against it. Most people don't do it enough times to shake off the fear, but even if you do it that many times, you always feel so shitty the days after. It's this deep listlessness that you can't snap out of.


Have you ever paused mid-sentence out of pure mental fatigue? Imagine pausing mid-*thought* out of extreme mental fatigue and just sitting there with dead eyes staring into nowhere for nearly a minute at a time. It's that bad. 


That being said, doses of less than 300 mg aren't horrible, and I would recommend sticking to those doses and listening to music more than anything. Diphenhydramine works best for music enhancement.

I won't send a dose recommendation other than *less*

1. benadryl sucks major ass to trip from anyway, but it tends to have a 'sweet spot,' which dosing beyond tends to cause uncomfortability.


I have enjoyed

a. not taking any benadryl

b. smoking cannabis to augment the benadryl I have stupidly taken

c. smoking amanitas, yes, amanitas--they help a bit with visuals and get rid of the awful awful cottonmouth

d. Drinking a beer to fall asleep quicker and forget that i have even taken benadryl


that said, your headed for trouble if you take alot of benadryl--it's not fun or comfortable. Be patient for true psychadelics and stop trying to get off to deliriants--they only screw you over.


If you want a fun, safer, shorter time to enjoy some deliriant effects/actual visuals


try mixing up a bowl of cannabis (heads work best) with dried datura leaves/pods 1:1

The thought of DPH makes my brain hurt and also makes me depressed... good lord what a terrible drug and what a terrible situation one must be in to enjoy using it (I know because I have been there in the past)


OP if I could I would buy you a 10-strip


Don't even feel bad about it though OP that was me a few years ago... all I can say is that you are better off just chilling out with out using drugs than resorting to DPH but I know if yo are in that situation you will think otherwise...

Be careful man, if you're building a tolerance to DPH you should be:


a) Worried about hepatoxicity, if you're using deliriant doses frequently enough to build tolerance, you're using frequently enough to hurt your liver!


b) Worried about acute cardiotoxicity caused by consuming large amounts at once.*

> QT interval prolongation in diphenhydramine toxicity

> Abstract 
> 
> Diphenhydramine overdose in one of the frequent reported causes of acute poisoning. Patients with diphenhydramine overdose can present with central nervous system manifestations, anticholinergic manifestations and cardiovascular symptoms. The cardiovascular symptoms of diphenhydramine overdose include myocardial depression and refractory hypotension. Massive ingestions have been reported to cause myocardial depressant effect with widening of QRS complex and prolonged QT interval on electrocardiogram. We report an adolescent male with moderate diphenhydramine ingestion, who was found unresponsive with seizure like activity. Electrocardiogram on presentation showed wide complex tachycardia with right bundle branch block pattern and QT interval prolongation. These changes reverted to normal with treatment. Diphenhydramine overdose may occasionally result in prolongation of QT interval.

My recommendation: Take a tolerance break. If you must use deliriants, please wait at least a month between fever-dreams (I'm not gonna call it a trip).

I know a very intelligent person who was/is addicted to diphenhydramine despite having access to plenty of other superior (in most peoples eyes, including mine) psychedelics. Some rare people seem to genuinely enjoy it. I can't help but wonder the likelihood of much different brain chemistry/drug processing than the vast majority regarding that. The only thing that is enjoyable in any way in diph to me and others I've talked to is the enhancement of music - to the point where it is actually more enjoyable/better appreciated than most substances I have taken. Still the shitty effects overshadow it by far.

While I don't think this is BL material, "tripping" is generally handled in the Psychedelic Drugs forum, so I'm going to toss this over there. Mods, feel free to do what you will/close if you'd like, etc.

Dimenhydrinate is just diphenhydramine compounded together with a stimulant to make it non-drowsy.


I still recommend not taking any delerients to get high.

That's not "tripping"


That's some sort of psychotic delirious state. If I made a deliriant topic I'd start it in Other Drugs.


To answer the OP's question - yes those two chemicals have very similar effects, but no the dimenhydrinate won't be as sedating as the diph, just watch the dosages. May I ask what you find enjoyable about overdosing on these though? If OTC drugs are your route, have you ever heard of dextromethorphan (DXM)? Now there's something more comparable to real tripping.

Well Dimenhydrinate is the 8-chlorotheophyllinate salt of diphenhydramine, so it would be pretty similar if not basically identical, dimenhydrinate has about half the sedative potential of diphenhydramine so i'de assume this would theoretically make you less drowsy. I don't have a lot of info to offer when it comes to higher doses of dramamine or benadryl as i generally only use it as a opiate potentiator or to sleep, so i don't dabble with anything over 125mg dph or 200mg dimenhydrinate. may i ask though, why is this categorized under opiates?

The usage of the term "trip" in your title is optimistic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).  Remember these drugs are classified as deleriants and be sure that is what you are looking for.


The dimenhydrinate salt dissociates into diphenhydramine and a stimulant which I don't remember the name of.  Dimenhydrinate is roughly half as potent by mass as diphenhydramine (as half it' mass is the stimulant) and will last longer as it needs to separate before becoming active.  I suppose the large amounts of the stimulant will effect the trip as well.


As this is a psychedelic question I'll send it over to Psychedelic Discussion for you but will mention that dextromethorphan is generally considered a much better choice as a psychoactive drug (dissociative) with generally the same OTC availability.


OD >>> PD


edit:

Completely missed the post between ours.  That's the stims name and as this was filed under opiates if you are somehow asking about using these to potentiate feel free to mention so and a mod will move it back to OD.

Yes, psychedelics and deliriants differ from each other and it's not just a mere interesting fact... everyone considering trying a deliriant should do well to find out exactly what is different about it and what kind of things can happen.

There is a significant lack of control or having more difficulty to tell what is real and what not, whereas psychedelics do warp things but not comparably so.

Can you "trip" taking staggered doses of Benadryl. Say 300 then 2 hours later take another 300. Do you need to take it all at once.


I could see someone being worried that with staggered doses you might not get the effects "trip" you were looking for, while taking dangerous levels of DPH


Wouldn't it be safer to take say 500mg all at once instead of baby stepping. I could see someone getting up to the 900mg taking 300mg doses every two hours and still not feel it. Like if you eat a gram of mushrooms wait an hour then take another 1/2 eighth, you wont trip as hard as you would have if you just ate 1/2 eight to begin with. Sort of the instant tolerance.

No its like hell hijacking your mind and taking over your reality, not you going there it comes at you.


I've had some truly terrifying experiences on DPH, many times I remember just being absolutely frozen with crippling terror and fear at what I was seeing.


That being said, I am glad I did it.


I don't see much reason to go back, but my DPH phase really thought me alot about myself and about the nature of fear.


Also makes you appreciate that we live in such a nice world and not in some type of dimension that is like a bug, spider, zombie infested torture chamber in hell.

Hi, this is my first time posting, so bear with me. Im not sure if this is the right thread, but I had a hard time figuring this out... SWIM is tired of paying for heroin, and is searching for a pill/medicine that is readily available w/o a prescription that produces similar effects. Obviousely, SWIM knows that any easily purchased drug from a pharmacy wont have near the intensity as that of h, but was just wondering if anything, if taken in high enough doses, could produce a similar blanket of warmth and serenity. Thanks alot!

**IN REFERENCE TO THE ORIGINAL POST:**


My experience with diphenhydramine is as follows:


in and of itself for recreational and/or "trip" value? 

Utter shit!


However, I do use it in increments of 75mg-125mg, four to five times daily. Every time I dose buprenorphine & butalbital I immediately proceed with it with diphenhydramine. I use 1mg of bupe four times daily; followed by anywhere from 200mg-900mg of butalbital roughly 15-30 minutes after taking bupe (i take butalbital four times daily as well).


I usually take an extra 75mg-100mg of diphenhydramine at night (not coinciding with dosing bupe or butalbital) & I have noticed the following benefits:

--it greatly increases the effects of buprenorphine AND butalbital

--it gives me a feeling I can only describe as "light" and "heady", not unlike benzodiazepines; an effect the barbiturate I take daily (butalbital) lacks 

--sedation

--minor anxiolytic effects


However I have noticed some detrimental effects from my diphenhydramine use:

--tolerance to the sedative & the minor anxiolytic effects occur relatively rapidly

--while the antagonism at H1 sub-receptors & anti-nauseated effects are said to last 24 hours, the sedation & minor anxiolytic effects last only 3-6 hours

--ataxia

--i have experienced marked withdrawal when immediately stopping diphenhydramine use (but while still taking my normal barbiturate & opioid doses)

--the withdrawal I experience includes insomnia, minor flu-like symptoms, excessive perspiration, decrease in buprenorphine effects, & to a lesser degree a decrease in barbiturate effects (butalbital)

My sweet spot is 300mg and I don't get delusional, just patterns n such. Completely impared visopn if trying to read. I've taken up to 700mg diphen at once. No more visual effects than 300mg. Everything above 300mg adds anxiety and that's all. I find that it increases mucus production too making it hard to swallow. This has lead to panic, but only when lying down.

It amazes me that packs of diphenhydramine 'sleep aids' don't come with a big, bold, italicized warning that overdose, even by as little as one tablet if one had 50mg strength pills and a certain ...nervous sensitivity, can produce experiences so unpleasant they make you wonder if those drug education teachers *were* telling the truth when they told you that taking drugs would lead you to eating your own dog's eyeballs.  


I've bought three packs of the stuff in the past couple of weeks, and not once did the pharmacist, or assistant, warn against taking too much.  Mind you, none of them knew what diphenhydramine even was.  Which is no crime, but if you're working in a Chemist, you should probably have some familiarity with the products you supply.

DPH is one terrifying drug. One experience I had with 650 mg in particular was very strange: after the heavy body load hit me, I was getting mild vertigo and nausea, which was uncommon for me.

So I reacted like I would if I were sober, and I took a shower, which helped quite a bit! (Turning off the shower was the worst part though, took me 10 seconds to figure it out) But as soon

as I left the shower I was FREEZING, I was so cold I couldn't think straight (or perhaps that was the DPH?![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)), I had to quickly stumble into my room and wrap myself in the cobwebbed blanket in my room. It took several minutes

before I felt warm, it was one of the worst feelings.

Pharmacists who don't know me always (!) ask me if I know how to dose them. But seriously, if you are the type of moron that will eat 13 pills you probably shouldn't be handling any medication on your own at all. Eating 10g Paracetamol will kill a lot of people (it's about the LD50 if I'm not mistaken). I've seen people eat more than that cause it just doesn't do shit when you're in the middle of a neuropathic shitstorm or whatever other pain that Paracetamol won't handle. A lot of people die of Paracetamol od's and liver failure and you're probably right that education in this field is lacking. Right now, I really wouldn't trust anyone with any meds in a package size above a deadly dose, noone who hasn't enjoyed such education. But then again, if you eat 15 allergy pills that really deserves some form of punishment lol.

Nah some people actually enjoy these delirium-like states for what they are. It is one of the only territories in the drug realm i have not personally ventured to, because i never had an opportunity or when i did it simply did not work. nonetheless, i sometimes enjoy my nightmares for their sheer wickedness, i also enjoyed the only paranoid delusional episode i had. that was drug induced, lasted less than day and had me out to save the world from ending that day while guys with dogs were chasing me through the woods. i looked like a mess afterwards, but foun my way back into reality. since then ive always appreciated this experience and im sure if i was properly sealed off from public an anticholinergic delirium might be very interesting as well.

it just isnt anything that you can just drop and enjoy. it requires a very particular interest in the experience id assume and should not be expected to be euphoric or pleasant in the classical sense. just really dark and twisted lol.


btw this is almost how i feel about mxe. that stuff just has no recreational potential for me, despite me being a HUGE ketamine and pcp fan. it just makes me feel nothingness where colorful visions of my subconscious would be expected with other dissociatives. plus, during that nothingness my mood was usually on the bad side. i tried dosing it in countless ways, varying roa's, dosages and combinations, it just always sucked balls and made me dizzy as hell. just very unenjoyable. weird how most people really enjoyed the stuff.

maybe the way you requested the medication made it seem as if you knew what you were doing? Or maybe he assumed you are abusing it? Either way, it is no good reason for not mentioning any sort of dosing regimen at all, eventhough it should be on the package insert as well. mine sometimes just mumble sth like "ye i know youre aware of how this is used" without really asking or telling me anything, just making sure they did their job.

**Diphenhydramine and It's Hallucinogenic Effetcs**


Not sure if this belongs here or whether it belongs in another dimension of Bluelight, so please Moderators move this at your will.


However I wish to discuss the Hallucinogenic effects of Diphenhydramine.


My personal experience with this drug has been purely auditory hallucinations with mild stimulation and some visual movements and change. Now I know Diphenhydramine is a deliriant and that it produces such effects but it seems to be a little more then that. So I was hoping to maybe get some peoples opinion and some experiences to lend me a little light on the subject.


1. . . 2. . . 3. . . GO!

My experience with this substance has always been pretty scary. Giant cockroaches chillin in the middle of my room, spiders pouring out of the sink. When I did it however I was in the 750-800 mg range.

I've had many many differing experiences with diphenhydramine. at lower doses (250-300mg) I found it pretty enjoyable if I had enough stimulation to keep me from dozing off; music was nice, fun patterns behind the eyelids, that sort of thing. the higher up you go tho, the sleepiness factor becomes much more pronounced. highest I ever went was somewhere around 800-900mg. I had loads of auditory and visual hallucinations, both of which were at times quite frightening and difficult to distinguish from reality. at one point I was on a walk around my neighborhood (not advisable btw) and I had several encounters with people and vehicles I later realized where never there. later in the evening I can even recall having whole conversations with more nonexistent people in my bedroom. most certainly an interesting and scary night. never stopped me from doing it more tho...

See I never have had full blown hallucinations. The only real thing is the auditory aspect. Hearing things that aren't there, sounds morphing and changing, echos. That sort of thing.

what kind of doses have you been taking? I notice the auditory part whenever I trip on the stuff (main reason I like it, makes electronic music VERY interesting) but I've only ever seen anything that wasn't there above like 500-600mg

The majority of my trips have been anywhere between 300 and 450mg, and one with 650mg. The heavy trip had the same auditory effects with again no visual (besides some slight morphing.

When i took 500mg the amount of people and voices talking to me was insane. In terms of visuals i had a few every now and then and definitely had the cobwebs/smoke/light fractions you can play with. What is your body weight, if you are heavier than the average person then you may require more. But truly it can get out of hand so don't over do it!!

**Benadryl**


Okay, ya ya, I know this seems stupid but I did this in the past. I decided to take benadryl since the last time I had auditory and visual CEVs and OEVs (Hallucinations that were real as looking at my hand! This will be the last time considering it's been 12 years since I last dosed. 


#1. How many to hallucinate?

#2 Howw many should I take?


A kind response without a lecture would be nice. P.s. Has anybody had these hallucinations off Benadryl (seeing spiders and things completely move as if it were absolutely real?)


Thanks guys

I take 100MG of it every night and that dose no more than maybe 150mg for some reason enhances physical senses and similar to MDMA or any Stimulant really. Try masterbating or having sex if possible it feeels unbelievably improved and much more great.

You might want to start there before posting about it next time.  All the information you seek is readily accessible whenever you want it man, try searching first.


As far as diphenhydramine goes though, I tried it once at about 300 mg and experienced no effects aside from drowsiness and slightly increased sensitivity to music.  I tried an equivalent dose of dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and experienced slight wall patterning, extreme paranoia, and a few shadow people out of the corner of my eye; basically comparable to slight amphetamine psychosis.  Not a whole lot of fun.


If you do decide to try it just bear in mind that dph is a deliriant and the hallucinations it produces are often described as terrifying and/or difficult to distinguish from reality (depending upon dose).  But then again, some people really like it so use your best judgement I guess.

I don't see the point of trying to get high from benedryl. I take it so I can get some sleep and that's it. Anything more than 75 mg gives me rebound scratchy throat drip and drymouth in the morning but I have sinus trouble.

Diphenhydramine (the active chemical in Benadryl)  is not a psychedelic its a deliriant. Other drugs in this family include tropane alkaloids most notably atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine which are found in  Datura stramonium (Jimson Weed) and Atropa belladonna (deadly nightshade). Deliriants induce a state of delirium (hence the name) along with a shitty body load (kinda like shrooms but 1000x worse) The experience is pretty much akin to taking a stroll through Silent Hill while melancholy drunk. DPH is pretty much schizophrenia in a pill. I know you don't want a lecture but let me give you my advice, don't fuck around with DPH. Deliriants are not fun drugs and a take a particularly fucked up individual to to enjoy them.


That being said I personal think the best way to take DPH is take about 200-225mg (I weigh about 180btw) You get really nice sedation and even mild euphoria, so just pop it before you go to bed.


If you want to trip you need to take at least 700mg. In addition to have some of the most terrifying realistic hallucinations of your life you will also feel like complete shit, i.e. complete restlessness horrible dry mouth (imaginable the worst cotton mouth you've ever had, then imagine scrubbing your tongue with a piece of burning sand paper) and being completely fucking confused, followed by the worst fucking hangover of your life. Keep in mind this is fucking horrible for you body and brain.


Head over to 420chan.org/del/ and taimapedia.org/index.php?title![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)PH for more info


Just a side note Dramamine (Dimenhydrinate) is no different  from DPH, its simply the DPH salt combined with a mild stimulint, so each pill only contain about 60% as much DPH so you need to take twice as much


But seriously just don't fuck with deliriants

UGH. i used to overuse diphenhydramine in high school, and it was totally unpleasant and just to alter myself in some way.


i find it totally insulting when i'm offered hydroxyzine for anxiety because it's basically the same fucking feeling. 


dried out, weird, unpleasant, icky. on one high dose i thought for sure my heart would stop. like was said above, i was unable to sleep and was awake clutching at my chest for quite some time.


not sure what is so great about hallucinating little spindly spiders either.

I usually use 25-50mg for sleep, if I want some kind of buzz I'll take 100-125mg and its kind of enjoyable. But you're barking up the wrong tree if you think you'll get ANY enjoyable trips from DPH. Most I took was probably 225mg ONCE. Made me feel super heavy and messed up, also I couldn't stop moving my legs like they hurt and moving was the only thing that made them feel better. Then I seen two red dots, like eyes from an animal, that started to scare the shit out of me. This was in the dark so I quickly shut my eyes and tried to fall asleep. Don't remember much after that.

IMO DPH always sucks, regardless of dose. It does exactly what its class implies, it makes you delirious. I've always compared it to the feeling of having a 103 fever and trying to fall asleep and just jerking around because you keep thinking someone's calling you or opening the door. I took 650 mgs one time(I was on a farm for a week with my family and couldn't remember the dosage, I remembered it being around there, maybe I confused it with dramamine?) and I was just laying in bed all night thinking that I was getting up and talking to people and shit and then I would just realize I did absolutely nothing and was just laying in bed the whole time. Even if I didn't majorly OD that one time, it always sucks, IMO.

Don't take diphenhydramine to get a buzz - it's more fun reading stories on Erowid about people who have rather than doing it yourself. It's not a good drug to trip on. 


The only things you should use Benadryl for are antinausea/antihistamine medication, as an opioid potentiator, and as a last-resort sleep aid. Not as a hallucinogen.


As otherts have pointed out, DPH is a deleriant similar to belladonna ro datura. It can make you really uncomfortable and make you have terrifyying hallucinations if you overdose. If you underdose you won't see anything  - at best you'll get really groggy and fall asleep. Unless you're a sadomasochist most people consider Nutmeg to be a better buzz... and that's saying something.

**WOW! What a huge mistake I made.** I took 500mg the night I posted this (before reading the warning replies on here), and the trip was horrible! My heart hurt very much as well as my whole body, I couldn't walk without slamming into something, I felt like I weighed a ton. All words on my computer or IPhone looked like a different language, I kept hearing random noises and voices like full blown conversations and nobody was home, Spiders were everywhere but I knew I was tripping (for some reason the auditory hallucinations we're way more frightening). Man, so many more hallucinations but I can't remember it all. **Worst Idea Ever! (other than taking 800mg of Wellbutrin). I posted THAT experience in Psychedelics and urge people to read it if ever considering messing with Antidepressants**. Anyways, to hell with that much Benadryl! Yet another naive, impulsive and foolish decision I've made. You live and learn...and I sure did learn the hard way.

I hope you find yourself some safer chems to trip on in the future.


As somebody who has played around quite a bit with everything, I really recommend seeking out lsd. There's really nothing quite like it for tripping, and it's relatively safe as well. I don't trust the NBOMEs. Had 300ug recently and was very sick with a rough come-up. And the LD50 on that stuff is pretty darn low.

I weigh around 210lbs. I only take 100mg to get some kind of enjoyable sedation, I guess I kind of enjoy the sleepyness that it gives me. I don't take it to "trip", I use for it's intended purpose; for sleep and for when I get stung by bees.

Wow you must being extremely sensitive to DPH then. I'm about 180 and I usually need about 200-225 for a nice sedative effect, that is the sedative feeling along with some euphoira, if I was using it as a sleep aid I'd probably only take the normal dosages

I saw the spiders at around 200mg; not much fun imo. All my true psychedelic experiences from DPH can be characterized as uncomfortable and not worth it.

I am a heavy diphen user with year+ experience (drug of choice) and spend alot of time researchimg this interesting compound and its effects.while i must agree orgasm on diphen is incredible, I have read reports of people suffering from erectile dysfunction after engaging in sexual stimulation on this drug and would advise against masturbation/sex while taking it

Diphenhydramine works it's magic way better when it's dark (like DXM). Dyphenhydramine CAN be very interesting and entertaining....but it's unpredictable, possibly dangerous (per the individual) and you have to have a strong hold of your mind to know what's real and what isn't. This is the key! I've even heard of people writing post-it notes everywhere saying "None of this is real". No joke. It can be THAT intense and terrifying, especially if you're not at all used to psychedelics. I wouldn't even recommend this at all if you've never used a Psychedelic drug. Even for people who are experienced with Acid and Shrooms (like myself) and have used DXM countless times (like myself lol), diphenhydramine is incredibly unique and deserves heavy mental preparation and respect to the before you tamper with high doses. Work your way up from small doses. It's just like any other psychedelic (for the most part)...have an open mind and prepare. I VERY MUCH recommend taking say, 50-75mg, every 45 minutes instead of taking a whole bunch at once (to gauge your tolerance if for the first time). In my opinion, this should be done whether a first timer or not. Diphenhydramine causes incredibly believable hallucinations. These hallucinations are completely different than normal psychedelics. This is why Diphenhydramine is considered a "dileriant" and not a "psychedelic", just like Datura, Morning Glory, Nightshade, etc. All of a sudden things just start appearing and they look completely real. You can and will be caught off guard constantly which is why I mentioned having mental strength and experience with hallucinogens and working up from low doses. This is not to deter anybody from trying it for the first time. Not at all. Just know what you're getting into, read other people's experiences and do some research beforehand. Last thing I'll say is this. Think of this drug and the events that will take place during your trip, as a very vivid, lucid dream (because in essence, that's what it is). Have you ever had a dream where you wake up and thought the events that took place really happened?? That is EXACTLY how diphenhydramine is. If anybody has a questions, please feel free to message me. Also, if on Anti-Depressants...I would strongly suggest staying completely away from this and pretty much anything to alter your state of mind. I had a horrible trip on twenty three 25mg Diphenhydramine tablets. I'm on 200mg Wellbutrin (an Anti-Depressant) twice a day and have been for a couple months. I didn't even put that into consideration. That being said, I'm not going to risk my life anymore. It just wasn't worth the strain it put my body through...especially my heart. Anyways,  Be safe everyone.

Dipenhydramine has Ssri properties. In low doses it also combines extremely well with alcohol, nitrous, dxm, or opiates.

300mg of Diphenhydramine with your preferred dose of diazepam is one of my favourite combos.  The diazepam blankets the more 'unpleasant' elements of the DPH trip (think of it as spider killer), whilst adding a nice sedation that seems to overpower the anti-histamine sluggishness.  But a word of warning: this combination can really fuck you up.  An example:


Earlier in the day on which I decided to take this combination I'd had a home visit from a community mental health nurse, which went really well and left me feeling positive and enthusiastic.  Taking advantage of this mindset I took the drugs.  Pretty shortly I found myself in the room I;d had my visit, chatting merrily away to the nurse, utterly oblivious to the fact that none of this was real.  I even got up to go and make her a cup of tea, but to my surprise on returning the room was now empty.  I shouted for my mother, 'Mum, mum!  Where's Jo gone?'

'Jo's not here...'

'But i made her a cup of tea and everything.'

'...Tell me what you've taken.  Do I need to call an ambulance?'


I'd be interested to hear from anyone who's combined DPH with Pregabalin.  Could have potential.

I don't know about it in its pure powder form but cvs makes a knock off robitussin gel cap thats 15mg of dxm and thats it. I'm actually trying it at the moment but with it being my first time and being cautious i seriously under did the dosage i think. 90mg (1.52mg/kg) so at the moment if i move my head to fast it takes minute for my mind to catch up and music sounds pretty good but that's about it. (typically take hydrocodone syrups but figure id try something else)

I've done it several times, the most I've ever done was 325mgs (13x25mg tabs) 


Anyways, I did have some worthwhile experiences, but its a pretty nasty drug, its just so... Gross feeling, and the hallucinations are so gloomy. The whole trip just feels kind of dark and depressing. I almost want to puke just looking at those nasty pink pills now.

^Just say that next time instead of saying that they're being too much of a pussy or however you phrased it. Also, folks don't consistently experience OEVs with dissociatives, so ymmv on that. Now I'm dragging this off topic, back to the DPH.

**DPH trip experiences**


I've recently started experimenting with DPH. From what I've seen online, (I always do research before trying something new) almost every DPH testimony is negative. I however haven't ever had a bad trip, and I'm curious to what others have recently experienced. I don't know if it's because I don't exceed 300mg, or what. But most of my experiences have been rather pleasant. I only do it once a month because from what I've read constant DPH use can really fuck up your brain, but I'm interested into why everyone else has awful trips and why I don't. So please respond with any info/story you would like to share! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

different chems effect people different ways. I myself. have never had a "bad" trip on dph and I actually went through a phase even when I had access to almost all psychadelics imaginable that I actually really liked dph. the delirium of hearing people call your name while your walking

down a street with Absolutely nobody on it is kinda cool to me. either way alotta people hate it some like it.

I feel like most people on Bluelight think that people who do DPH are just kids looking to get "messed up". While this is true for the majority, I am quite different. Last time I took 300mg and redosed up to 600mg, this time I'm going to start with 500mg. It can be a cool, interesting drug if you're smart about using it.

That right there made me ignore the post.


If you have to back-up yourself up on what a majority of people might perceive you as, it's time for self awareness...


Diphenhydramine is a really udderly stupid drug to abuse. It will kill you at those doses.


It is very very bad for your heart in higher doses and will give you a random heart attack or stoke...


I highly advise anyone taking elephant doses to at least consider buying booze instead... That is way less acutely toxic... LOL

No, I was just admitting that the majority of people do use it irresponsibly. Blame the user, not the substance. In doses less than 800mg, DPH is a fun and relatively safe drug.

Most users who abuse this drug are stupid in the fact that there is no safe way to abuse this drug.


A safe dose is half of the dose you mentioned.


You will create blood pressure problems for yourself if you keep dosing that high.

I don't see why people keep bashing on those who actually find some value in experiencing true hallucinations in an anticholinergic delirium. It is dangerous for sure, deadly even in rare cases. But then again isn't scoring a bag of H from your street dealer and shooting it up your veins just as dangerous? I rarely see anyone hating on heroin addicts for being "stupid" here, eventhough they run the risk of dying with every novel bag that comes their way. And for what? What makes their experience objectively more recreationally valuable than a delirium? We should remind ourselves what "recreational" really means here... Ofc opiate use is easier to understand, since opiates cause a considerable degree of euphoria in most people and most of us also have some regressive tendencies to some degree.


I've personally only experienced full-blown delirium once, but I honestly wouldn't want to miss the experience! It's something that no other class of drugs can offer. Experiencing another ephemeral religious revelation on a breakthrough dose of DMT or testifying my unconditional love to whomever is sitting next to me on 150mg MDMA seems pretty bland and undesirable from where I am standing today and I'd be a lot more tempted to reach for a deliriant if I want to experience something fresh and unique.

When I take diphen I have the same hallucinations every time. Like cats, people I know, and spiders lots of spiders. Does anyone else have this effect? Or is it more diverse as far as the visual aspect goes for you?

I've been wondering why many people disregard hallucinations that happen in delirium as "random" or disconnected from the self. Maybe you could try to interpret whatever it is you experience in detail the same way you would interpret a dream. While dissociatives and psychedelics often give me the sensation that what I am experiencing is extremely profound, it often is not when I look back at the experience. It might just be the other way around for the content of deliria. Dreams have helped me tackle issues that have been keeping my subconsciousness busy many times, eventhough many of the elements in my dreams are just random bits of sensory input processed during the previous day (random trash). I know what cats and spiders respectively mean to me when they occur in a dream, what do they mean to you? Which people do you see and could it be that you should take a closer look at some aspects of your relationship with them? Even if the content was completely disconnected from who you are, attempts at interpretation are a great way to stimulate yourself cognitively.


That being said, seeing spiders (also mice and other critters) seems to be a very common occurence in a delirium. ;D

**Diphenhydramine HCl Testing**


Hello, everyone. I have been doing research on the "trips" people experience on Diphenhydramine. I have also done alot of experimenting on myself using the "equate" off-brand of benedryl.


The first night I tried this... I had the mindset of "I'm gonna trip balls" and basically, I didn't take enough at first. I took 125mg, then 2 hours later took 150mg. After taking the first dosage, I didn't experience anything other than paranoia, and a slight stomach ache. After the second dosage, I had very vivid, frightening "hallucinations". I knew they werent real AFTER they had happened. I spider crawled on my leg, I crushed it on my leg, when I raised my hand to look there was nothing there. I searched for 30 minutes, then came to the conclusion that it didn't actually happen. I was very lightheaded, but too uncomfortable to relax. I came down a few hours later.


The next night, I decided to try to take a larger dose. I took 400mg and experienced very strange vision blurs... Posters seem to slide up the walls slowly and if I looked into dark corners I could see bright flashes of colors. I was extremely paranoid at this dosage. But, because of being curious, I took an additional 200mg. I became very drowzy. I fought this feeling for about an hour, after which my body began to feel very heavy. I was scared I was going to die when I looked at my chest and saw it thumping with my pounding heartbeat. I touched my chest and felt nothing, so I assumed this was another hallucination. I continued on my "trip" not feeling very good. I went to bed having conversations in my head, talking with my friends, even going to other places (restaurants, homes, etc.) only to realize I was still at home in bed when I opened my eyes. I eventually fell asleep.


Now, SWIM came over to hang out one night and took a total of 750mg. But... He took 350mg, then he took 200mg 30 minutes later, then 100mg 30 minutes later, then 50mg 30 minutes after that. He had a vivid hallucination of deer fighting in the road while we were outside, experienced similar vision blurs and minor "trips" as I did. Nothing much after that.


The next night, I decided I would take a lower dosage. I took 300mg, sat down and played some halo. After a couple games I started feeling pretty good. I became very relaxed, playing the game had distracted me from "waiting" for the effects to kick in. after about an hour, I took 50mg more. 15 minutes later I felt very light, my fingers felt good when I would wiggle them and everything was funnier. I thought it was a fluke. I stayed up 3 hours feeling this way. Then I went to bed and slept. I woke up and felt a bit of an afterglow, but it wasnt bad. I was slightly dazed, but very happy. 


I decided to try this again, so I took the same dosage of 300mg, played some halo, then took 50mg more an hour later. This really seems to do the trick for me. So I decided to try it on the same SWIM who had stayed the night before last. About an hour passed and I game him 50mg more. He and I were watching netflix and he said it hit him out of nowhere and he felt "godly" and even went as far as to ask if it was the same thing he took last time. Our description of the feeling is very similar. It feels like you have smoked mary jane, but with some minor visuals. We have been doing this exact technique of taking diphenhyramine for about a week, and it seems to feel better each time. 


My guess is you just have to get used to it, and find the right dose. I have truly enjoyed watching movies, playing games, and even just talking to my friends while using diphenhyramine.


!!BUT!!


When SWIM gave these pills, at this dosage to one of his friends, he didnt enjoy the experience, saying he felt "wobbly" and telling us he thought his mind and body had separated and that he was having an out of body experience. So this definitely has varying effects depending on who you are. 


I post this why?


Because from most of my findings online, everyone is saying that this is just awful, which it is the first time. Just realize there is an upside for some.


Please feel free to ask questions, as Ive been doing this for awhile now.

Nasty stuff, but works well at 50mg for allergies or sleep.  Bumping for prune.
