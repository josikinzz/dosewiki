## Subjective Experience

This one is tricky: as in my personal inability to distinguish between the varying
effects of the different lysergamides.

I understood that 75ug was a small dose, but I only possessed three blotters in total,
and I wanted to test gently. Nonetheless, the familiar headspace soon emerged, as
did a nice mood elevation.

It is commonly claimed that LSZ offers more introspection than its more popular
sisters, LSD and AL-LAD. I looked for this, but didn’t really find it. Regardless, the
few low-end trips I experienced were very enjoyable.

In retrospect, I should have gone higher whilst this was still on the market. Having
stated this, I have no reason to believe that it would have produced a significantly
different experience to that of its close relatives (see previous reports).
