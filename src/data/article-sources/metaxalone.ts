## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenol ethers. These are aromatic compounds containing an ether group substituted with a benzene ring.

### Background

Metaxalone is a moderate to strong muscle relaxant used in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. It is marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Skelaxin®. Its main mechanism of action is thought to involve general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone is associated with few side effects and is available as a 800 mg scored tablet.

### Indication

For the treatment of painful peripheral musculoskeletal conditions and spasticity from upper motor neuron syndromes.

### Pharmacodynamics

Metaxalone is a skeletal muscle relaxant indicated as an adjunct to rest, physical therapy, and other measures for the relief of discomforts associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. The mode of action of this drug has not been clearly identified, but may be related to its sedative properties. Metaxalone does not directly relax tense skeletal muscles in man.

### Absorption

The absolute bioavailability of metaxalone from Skelaxin tablets is not known.

### Metabolism

Probably hepatic.

### Half-life

9.2 (+/- 4.8) hours

### Toxicity

LD
50
=775mg/kg (Rat, oral); LD
50
=1690 mg/kg (Mouse, oral). When determining the LD
50
in rats and mice, progressive sedation, hypnosis and finally respiratoryfailure were noted as the dosage increased. In dogs, no LD
50
could be determined as the higher doses produced an emetic action in 15 to 30 minutes. Some adverse events associated with the drug include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and CNS side effects such as dizziness, headache, and irritability.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of CNS depression can be increased when Metaxalone is combined with 1,2-Benzodiazepine.
Abacavir
Metaxalone may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Aceclofenac
Aceclofenac may decrease the excretion rate of Metaxalone which could result in a higher serum level.
Acemetacin
Acemetacin may decrease the excretion rate of Metaxalone which could result in a higher serum level.
Acetaminophen
Acetaminophen may decrease the excretion rate of Metaxalone which could result in a higher serum level.

### Food Interactions

Avoid excessive or chronic alcohol consumption. Alcohol may increase the CNS depressant effects of metaxalone.
Take with or without food. The absorption of metaxalone is increased when taken with food, which may increase CNS depression, especially in the elderly.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaxalone*

Metaxalone, sold under the brand name Skelaxin, is a muscle relaxant medication used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it may be due to general central nervous system depression. It is a moderately strong muscle relaxant, with relatively low incidence of side effects.
Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and central nervous system (CNS) side effects, such as dizziness, headache, and irritability.
The metabolism of metaxalone involves enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 in the cytochrome P450 system.  Because many medications are metabolized by enzymes in this system, precaution must be taken when administering it with other medications involving the P450 system to avoid interactions.
Because of the potential for side effects, this drug is considered high risk in the elderly.

## Pharmacokinetics

Metaxalone exhibits increased bioavailability when taken with food. Specifically, in one study, compared to fasted conditions, the presence of food at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 77.5%, AUC0-t by 23.5%, and AUC0-∞ by 15.4%.  Metaxalone is a substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A, and an inducer of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4.

## Assay

A literature survey reveals very few methods are reported for the determination of metaxalone to date.  Nirogi et al. reported a liquid chromatographic method coupled to tandem mass spectrometry for the quantification of metaxalone in human plasma. A stability-indicating HPLC method was introduced by P. K. Sahu et al. Metaxalone has been used as an internal standard for few analytical methods.
