1P-ETH-LAD, also known as 1-propionyl-6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is the 1-propionyl derivative of ETH-LAD and is thought to act as a prodrug of ETH-LAD analogously to how 1P-LSD acts as a prodrug of LSD.

## Use and effects

Like ETH-LAD, this drug has been reported to be significantly more potent than LSD itself, and is reported to largely mimic ETH-LAD's psychedelic effects.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

Research has shown formation of ETH-LAD from 1P-ETH-LAD incubated in human serum, suggesting that it functions as a prodrug.

## Chemistry

### Analogues

Analogues of 1P-ETH-LAD include 1P-LSD and 1P-AL-LAD, among others.

## History

1P-ETH-LAD has little history of human usage before January 2016.
