## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 0.76 g LAH in 50 mL THF was stirred under an inert atmosphere, and treated with the dropwise addition of a solution of 2.5 g N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-4-methoxytryptamine in 30 mL anhydrous THF. The reaction mixture was held at reflux for 30 min, then cooled to 40 Â°C and the excess hydride destroyed with the addition of 50% aqueous THF. The solids were removed by filtration, washed with THF, the filtrate and washings combined, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue, impure 4-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine, was dissolved in 50 mL EtOH ethanol, treated with 1.0 mL acetone, then with 0.5 g 10% Pd/C, and the reaction mixture shaken under a hydrogen atmosphere at 50 psi for 15 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a bed of Celite, the filtrate stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the solid residue recrystallized from Et2O/hexane to give 0.51 g N-isopropyl-4-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine 4-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (4-MeO-MIPT) which had a mp 80â81 Â°C. Anal: C15H22N2O. C,H,N. MS (in m/z): C5H12N+ 86 (100%); indolemethylene+ 160 (4%); parent ion 246 (6%).


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 17 mg, orally) âI am aware of this at 40 minutes, and was in a very light but not very well defined place for about two hours. It was neither good nor bad. It kind of drifted away and I was not sure when I regained baseline.â

(with 26 mg, orally) âI took this orally, in dilute hydrochloric acid so that it would be in solution going down. I was aware in 20 minutes, and went right up to a +3 within the hour. That was quite a bit of change in a half hour. Extremely erotic, but absolutely no visuals to music, either with eyes open or with them closed. I know I am at +3 since there is no way I could drive a car, not for anything in the world, but why not? Donât know, but no way. Cold gaspatcho gespatcho tastes superb, but one cup is enough, and the croissant seems dry and hard. By seven hours I am back where I started from again. Pity.â

(with 26 mg, orally) âThis is my first try with this drug, ever. First indications of effects in twenty minutes. Quiet onset, no remarkable visuals, in fact no particular visuals at all. To a +2 plus two within about ten or fifteen minutes more. Body is comfortable, mind-set pretty much unchanged from baseline. No euphoria, no insights. But also, no discomfort. Erotic was extremely successful, and orgasm seemed easier than with other materials. Still no visuals but seemed to be a soft +3 plus three. Music fine. Hard to define exactly how we knew we were in an altered state, because of the lack of visual clues. Body aware more than mind. Would like to explore this further. Perhaps for writing? Nice material. Maybe higher next time?â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
A similar discussion could be made about the corresponding compounds that possess the N,N-dimethyl pattern of DMT. Again, there are a total of four possible ring-methoxylated isomers. The 5-substituted compound is 5-MeO-DMT and, as it is remarkably potent, it is given its own entry. However, the other three monomethoxy analogues, 4-methoxy-, 6-methoxy- and 7-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, remain relatively unknown.

The 4-methyl ether of psilocin, 4-MeO-DMT, is especially appealing, in that it is a simple homologue of psilocin and it is quite stable. But the methyl group as an ether link lacks the lability of the phosphate or acetate esters, and it cannot be easily hydrolyzed off to form psilocin. The immediate homologue is 4-MeO-DET which is completely without action either orally or by smoking at dosages up to 30 mgs. The two remaining DMT isomers are with the methoxy at the 6-position (to give 6-MeO-DMT originally thought to be a minor alkaloid in B. caapi) and at the 7-position (to give 7-MeO-DMT which was observed as a minor impurity in the preparation of 7-MeO-MIPT). Some rat studies were performed in the mid 60âs on all three of these compounds. A couple of years later the 4-isomer was studied in the squirrel monkey and found to have weak central activity (size discrimination studies with rewards of grapes, underwater maze running with rewards of simply being allowed to survive). These studies suggested that it was not very potent, certainly much less potent than 5-MeO-DMT, but no trial has as yet been reported in man for any of these three isomers. If this lower potency were to hold up in human trials, it would give additional support to the positional parallels between the â4-positionâ of the phenethylamines, and the â5-positionâ of the tryptamines. That is where, indeed, the action is to be found. All of these methoxylated DMT analogues will probably be pretty easily destroyed metabolically, so some parenteral route might have to be used in exploring them. Right here, in the above preparation, 4-methoxy-N-methyltryptamine (4-MeO-NMT) has been made as a chemical intermediate, but it was not characterized, and no spotlight was put on it as a potential drug in its own rights. It is the ether that corresponds to the natural ester baeocystin baeocystine, and it probably wouldnât come off gracefully, either chemically or metabolically. There is yet another mushroom analogue here. The starting material is the bare tryptamine itself, 4-MeO-T, which is the ether counterpart to norbaeocystin norbaeocystine.

The bottom line is, that all of these intriguing compounds are largely strangers to us.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-MeO-MiPT*

4-MeO-MiPT, also known as 4-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a lesser-known psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-methoxytryptamine families. It is the 4-methoxy analogue of MiPT and the O-methyl ether of 4-HO-MiPT. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. The drug produces psychedelic-like effects in animals.
4-MeO-MiPT was first described by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1985. It was subsequently further described by Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known And Loved). The drug was reported as a novel designer drug by 2016. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-MeO-MiPT.

## Use and effects

Shulgin found the effective dose to be 20 to 30 mg (or ~0.4 mg/kg body weight of subject) orally; the onset between ingestion and the first noticeable effects was 20 to 40 minutes, with a listed duration of 4 to 6 hours. The effects were significantly milder than those of 4-HO-MiPT, with 4-MeO-MiPT producing erotic-enhancing effects, and few of the visuals common with tryptamines.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-MeO-MiPT acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) and non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C receptors. Affinities towards receptors outside of the serotonin receptor family have not yet been assessed.
Increased extracellular concentrations of serotonin, resulting from SERT blockade, similarly may compete at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, altering or blunting effects mediated by this receptor, which could potentially explain anecdotal reports of subjective effects being dose-dependently milder than that of 4-HO-MiPT or 5-MeO-MiPT. This profile makes 4-MeO-MiPT a potential candidate for elucidating the role of SERT blockade in the mechanisms underlying serotonergic psychedelic action.
The drug induces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. Its potency for inducing the head-twitch response in mice is similar to that of 4-HO-MiPT and 4-AcO-MiPT, but the efficacy for doing so is markedly lower: 34 head twitches versus around 80 head twitches per 30 minutes for the aforementioned compounds.

## Chemistry

4-MeO-MiPT is synthetic derivative of the substituted tryptamine and 4-methoxytryptamine families. It is the 4-methoxy analogue of N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT) and the O-methyl ether of 4-HO-MiPT.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-MeO-MiPT has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 4-MeO-MiPT include N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine (MiPT), 4-methoxytryptamine (4-MeO-T), 4-MeO-DiPT, 4-MeO-DMT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-AcO-MiPT, 5-MeO-MiPT, 5-MeO-DMT, and psilocin (4-HO-DMT), among others.

## History

4-MeO-MiPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1985. Subsequently, it was described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known Loved) as entry #39. The pharmacology of 4-MeO-MiPT was studied and described in the 2020s. It was reported as a novel designer drug by at least 2016.
