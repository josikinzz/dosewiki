**Mexedrone** ( **3-methoxy-2-(methylamino)-1-(p-tolyl)propan-1-one** also known as **4-MMC-MeO** ) is a putative [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and possible [euphoriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cathinone) chemical class with a potency of roughly 1/10th of that of [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .

This compound has little to no history of human usage prior to its release in August 2015 as a newly available grey area research chemical. It has been primarily marketed as a legal alternative to [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) although anecdotal reports seem to universally suggest that it is largely inferior in its recreational effects due to its weaker potency, lack of [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . It may have been developed as a result of another much more effective, but problematic mephedrone derivative, N-methoxymephedrone.

## Chemistry

Mexedrone, or 3-methoxy-2-(methylamino)-1-(p-tolyl)propan-1-one, is a synthetic molecule of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) family. Cathinones are structurally similar to [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) . They contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines and cathinones are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. Cathinones contain an additional ketone group bonded at R 1 .

Mexedrone contains additional methyl substitutions at R N (similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) ) and R 4 of its phenyl ring. Mexedrone is named for the methoxy group (C 3 O-) bound to the methyl group located at R α . Mexedrone is closely analogous to mephedrone, however, mephedrone lacks the additional methoxy group bonded to the α-methyl group.

## Pharmacology

Mexedrone acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and a [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for monoamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) . Despite its chemical similarity to [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , it lacks the dopamine and noradrenaline releasing properties, and is approximately 10-20x weaker in its reuptake inhibiting and serotonin releasing properties.

This increase in neurotransmitters provides an explanation for the [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria) and anecdotal [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) effects induced by this experience. The serotonergic activity with lack of significant dopaminergic and noradrenergic activity is similar to that of [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) and consistent with usage reports that often state that mexedrone is more sedating than stimulating.

Due to the much lower potency (1/7 to 1/20th at different monoamine transporters) compared to mephedrone, considerably higher doses are required to achieve noticeable effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - The biggest difference between mexedrone and [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) is that it primarily results in moderate sedation over [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and can therefore discourage physical activities such as running, dancing or climbing.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of mexedrone can be described as a mild soft and warm tingling sensation that encompasses the entire body. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component can be considered to be less intense when compared with that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Mild emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within mexedrone and are likely a direct result of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) release.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational mexedrone use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because mexedrone has very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried mexedrone within the community suggest that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of mexedrone can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of mexedrone develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Mexedrone presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of mexedrone all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Mexedrone should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Mexedrone may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

## Legal status

Mexedrone is not a controlled substance in most countries, meaning it is ostensibly legal to possess and distribute. However, the sale for human consumption or the use for non-medical or research purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under an analogue law.

- **Brazil:** As of September 7, 2018, all cathinone analogues are controlled substances considered illegal to possess, use and distribute. This was made possible due to a blanket ban law appended to Portaria SVS/MS nº 344.
- **Sweden** : Mexedrone is a controlled substance and is therefore illegal to import, produce, sell or possess.
- **Switzerland** : Mexedrone is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E.
- **United Kingdom:** It is illegal to produce, supply, or import this drug under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
