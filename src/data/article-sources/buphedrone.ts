Buphedrone, also known as α-methylamino-butyrophenone (MABP), is a stimulant of the phenethylamine and cathinone chemical classes that was first synthesized in 1928. It is a synthetic analogue of cathinone, a stimulant naturally occurring in the khat plant. Like many other synthetic cathinones (e.g. mephedrone), it is also found in so called "legal highs" (sometimes also called "bath salts"), a class of designer drugs used to bypass legal restrictions.

## Pharmacology

This substance is part of the cathinone family, which is considered to have the two relatives, namely phenethylamines (e.g. venlafaxin and more wider also including cocaine), and amphetamines in terms of how this substance is working at the human brain (that is, these substances are not activating postsynaptic receptors by themself, but are binding to specific receptors, which then, this receptors increases the concentration of endogenous monoamines in the human brain).

## Chemistry

Buphedrone is a β-ketone and is related to the naturally occurring compounds cathinone and cathine. It is also related to methamphetamine, differing by the β-ketone substituent (at the β-carbon) and an ethyl group replacing the methyl group at the carbon at the α-position relative to the amine. Another name for buphedrone is phenylacetoethyl-methylamine.
Buphedrone as free base is very unstable; it is prone to dimerization like other α-amino ketones. Because of this, it is sold as various salts, with a hydrochloride being most common.

## Effects

Buphedrone increases spontaneous rodent locomotor activity, potentiates the release of dopamine from dopaminergic nerve terminals in the brain, and causes appetite suppression. It also causes a possibly dangerous effect of decreasing subjective feeling of thirst. Though the specific effects and toxicity of buphedrone are not well studied, in general it is expected to have overlapping effects with other synthetic cathinones.

## Legal status

As of October 2015, buphedrone is a controlled substance in China.
Buphedrone is an Anlage II controlled drug in Germany.
In the United States, buphedrone is considered a schedule 1 controlled substance as a positional isomer of mephedrone.
