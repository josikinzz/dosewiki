## Subjective Experience

This was launched under the authentic Spice brand, and as far as I can recall, was the
first variation from JWH-018 in the original series. As a novice, the difference
between them was difficult to establish.

Again, certain elements of the experience were cannabis-like, but only to a limited
extent. Some aspects were absent, and others were somewhat distorted. However, at
the time it offered a decent enough experience to repeatedly engage.

On the face of it, this chemical seemed to have a similar safety profile to its earlier
cousin. Given what was eventually to emerge in terms of synthetic cannabinoids, this
was probably a positive.

The spice brand itself disappeared not far down the track, before most of the stronger
cannabinoids became available under a huge variety of different labels and names.
Its legacy, however, including the misappropriation of its name, remained.
