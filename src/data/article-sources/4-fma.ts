**4-Fluoromethamphetamine** (also known as **4-FMA** ) is a lesser-known novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) - [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. 4-FMA is chemically related to [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . Little is known about its pharmacology, but it likely produces its effects by increasing levels of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in the brain.

4-FMA was first detected being sold in Japan as a legal high in 2006. It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) alongside [2-fluoroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FA) (2-FA), 3-fluoroamphetamine (3-FA) and [4-fluoroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) (4-FA). When 4-FA was made illegal in the Netherlands in 2017, 4-FMA grew in popularity as a legal substitute, due to their similar names and effects. In 2018, the number of analyzed 4-FA samples increasingly contained 4-FMA (and/or other fluorinated amphetamines) and the availability of actual 4-FA decreased sharply.

User reports describe the effects of 4-FMA as having characteristics of both traditional stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Its effects have been described as subjectively lying between [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) and [2-FMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-FMA) . It has been reported to be more likely to produce side effects like [headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches) and cardiovascular effects than similar substances.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 4-FMA. 4-FMA use may produce dependence and abuse as well as damage to the brain and other organs. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

4-Fluoromethamphetamine (4-FMA) is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) family. Molecules of this class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . The term "amphetamine" is the contracted form of a lpha-methyl phen e t hyl amine . 4-fluoromethamphetamine contains a fluorine atom at R 4 of its phenyl ring and is therefore a fluorinated analogue of methamphetamine.

## Pharmacology

Similar to its structural analog [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , 4-Fluoromethamphetamine is thought to act as a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , producing stimulating amphetamine-like effects at lower doses and more euphoric, [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects similar to MDA at dosages above 125mg. [*[avoid opinion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Content_Style_Guide_-_Substance#Writing_style)*] Researchers have found some evidence that indicates some similarities between the "Serotonin Release" of 4-FMA and other popular empathogens such as: [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [4-Methylmethcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , and [4-fluoroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) . .

The mechanism of action of 4-FMA effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in higher doses in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally clear these monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin to accumulate within various regions of the brain, including its reward pathways, resulting in stimulating, euphoric and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects.

4-FMA is a CYP450 inhibitor. It reduces the metabolism of methamphetamine, which has the effect of increasing its potency, duration and systemic toxicity while also reducing its cellular toxicity.

## Subjective effects

In low doses, 4-FMA has been reported to be a lackluster [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) for general productivity. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Such usage would be strongly discouraged however, due to the increased risks for neurotoxicity and other dangerous side-effects. The reasoning for this warning is based on the studies showing that 4-FMA is similar to [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , and belongs to the [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) class. Using any entactogen frequently is considered dangerous, and it is seen as unwise to take "microdoses" below the minimum dose required to experience a "roll" with members of the [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) class. At higher dosages, it is known to become dysfunctional and recreational due to the scattering quality of its [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Similar to [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) , [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , and other substances that produce distinct pleasurable tactile "roll"-like sensations, which is typically linked to serotonin-releasing properties, 4-FMA has been reported to be able to produce similar [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects in addition to traditional stimulant ones. Some reports suggest it tends to come with more side effects and bodily strain than other fluorinated amphetamines, explaining its lack of popularity and availability.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - As with most strong stimulants, 4-FMA has been reported to produce states of paranoia, although it is not clear to which extent this happens relative to other stimulants and under what conditions. ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 4-Fluoromethamphetamine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4Fluoromethamphetamine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

**Do not use 4-FMA if you have a history of heart-related issues or experience severe headache after its use.** We have been made aware of a report released by Trimbos-instituut and Nationaal Vergiftigingen Informatie Centrum (NVIC), describing incidents of strokes after an increased use of the closely related analogue 4-FA, and there is no reason this does not apply to 4-FMA as well. In addition to the common amphetamine-like effects (agitation, anxiety, tachycardia, hypertension, chest pain et al.), serious cardio- and cerebrovascular complications have been reported, including rhythm (sinus arrhythmia, ventricular extrasystoles (bigeminy), conduction disturbances) and acute cardiac failure. Although a causal relationship has not been confirmed, when presented with a severe headache and lateralization after 4-FA usage, a medical evaluation at an emergency department should be conducted immediately.

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-FMA use has not been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 4-FMA has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) (mouse; i.p.) of 4-FMA is unknown. While 4-FA does not cause long-lasting depletion of brain [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) unlike [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) 's analogs [4-CA](/w/index.php?title=4-CA&action=edit&redlink=1) and [4-BA](/w/index.php?title=4-BA&action=edit&redlink=1) , it is unknown whether this also applies to 4-FMA as well.

4-FMA is reported to be particularly caustic in comparison to other compounds and can, therefore, cause chemical burns within the nasal passage and throat if it is [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflated) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of 4-FMA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 4-FMA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). This is how long it takes to reduce the tolerance for the stimulating effects. Tolerance for the [entactogenic effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement) may take a longer period to reduce. 4-FA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-FMA all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the amphetamine chemical class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Legal status

  "wikipedia": `# 4-Fluoromethamphetamine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Fluoromethamphetamine*

4-Fluoromethamphetamine (4-FMA) is a stimulant drug related to methamphetamine and 4-fluoroamphetamine. It has been reported to be sold as a designer drug, but little is known about its pharmacology or toxicology. It was first detected from legal highs sold in Japan in 2006 and became illegal to sell or to possess for the purpose of distribution (although not to simply possess for personal use) in Japan in 2008. It was initially reported to be contained as an ingredient in some of the range of party pills sold internationally by the Israeli company Neorganics from around 2006 onwards, but this was later shown to be incorrect and this ingredient was eventually identified as the closely related compound 2-fluoromethamphetamine.

## Pharmacology

4-FMA is a CYP450 inhibitor. It reduces the metabolism of methamphetamine, which has the effect of increasing its potency, duration and systemic toxicity while also reducing its cellular toxicity.

## Legal status

### Australia

4-FMA is considered a Schedule 9 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.

### Canada

As of 1996, 4-FMA is a controlled substance in Canada, due to being an analog of methamphetamine.

### China

As of October 2015 4-FMA is a controlled substance in China.

### Finland

Scheduled in the "government decree on narcotic substances, preparations and plants" and is therefore illegal.

### United States

As a close analog of scheduled controlled substance, sale or possession of 4-FMA could be potentially be prosecuted under the Federal Analogue Act if intended for human consumption.
