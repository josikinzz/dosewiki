4,4'-Dimethylaminorex (abbreviated as 4,4'-DMAR), sometimes referred to by the street name "Serotoni", is a psychostimulant and entactogen designer drug related to aminorex, 4-methylaminorex, and pemoline. It was first detected in the Netherlands in December 2012, and has been sold as a designer drug around Europe since mid-2013.
4,4'-DMAR had been linked to at least 31 deaths in Hungary, Poland, and the UK by February 2014, mostly when consumed in combination with other drugs. Nineteen deaths linked to 4,4'-DMAR were reported in Northern Ireland in the same time period.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4,4'-DMAR is a monoamine releasing agent (MRA) and acts specifically as a highly potent and well-balanced serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA), with EC50 values for serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine release of 18.5 nM, 26.9 nM, and 8.6 nM, respectively. It also interacts with the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) with similar potency as MDMA.

In contrast to many other MRAs, 4,4'-DMAR is inactive as a trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) agonist. As a result, whereas many other MRAs may auto-inhibit and constrain their effects via TAAR1 agonism, this may not occur with 4,4'-DMAR. The drug also shows very weak interactions with the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, though appears to be inactive at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor.
