**3-MeO-PCE may have a higher risk of causing [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to take this substance in high dosages, for multiple days in a row, or in combination with other substances known to increase the risk of psychosis. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCE#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**3-Methoxyeticyclidine** (also known as **Methoxieticyclidine** and **3-MeO-PCE** ) is a novel [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) substance of the [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) class that produces [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) and [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogenic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) . It is a structural analog of [PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCE) .

3-MeO-PCE began to gain popularity in 2010 and is sold on the online grey area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market as a legal alternative to [PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PCP) or [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) .

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 3-MeO-PCE, and it has a very brief history of human usage. It is strongly recommended that one use harm reduction practices if using this substance.

## Chemistry

3-MeO-PCE, or N-Ethyl-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexan-1-amine, is classed as an [arylcyclohexylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Arylcyclohexylamine) drug. Ayrlcyclohexylamine drugs are named for their structures which include a cyclohexane ring bound to an aromatic ring along with an amine group. 3-MeO-PCE contains a phenyl ring with a methoxy (CH 3 -O-) substituent at R 3 bonded to a cyclohexane ring. Bound to the same carbon (R 1 ) of the cyclohexanone ring is an amino ethyl chain -NCH 2 CH 3 . 3-MeO-PCE, like [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , contains an amino ethyl chain rather than the amino methyl chain found in [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . 3-MeO-PCE is analogous to [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , but lacks an R 2 substituted ketone. It is also homologous to [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) but lacks the additional carbons to complete a piperidine ring.

## Pharmacology

3-MeO-PCE acts principally as an [NMDA receptor antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/NMDA_receptor_antagonist) . NMDA receptors allow for electrical signals to pass between neurons in the brain and spinal column; for the signals to pass, the receptor must be open. Dissociatives close the NMDA receptors by blocking them. This disconnection of neurons leads to loss of feeling, difficulty moving, and eventually an almost identical equivalent of the famous “ [k-hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole) .”

3-MeO-PCE has Ki values of 61 nM for the NMDA receptor, 743 nM for the dopamine transporter, 2097 nM for the histamine H2 receptor, 964 nM for the Alpha-2A adrenergic receptor, 115 nM for the serotonin transporter, 4519 nM for the σ1 receptor and 525 nM for the σ2 receptor.

## Subjective effects

3-MeO-PCE can be said to share extremely similar properties to that of [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) but with a potentially higher risk of inducing states of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and potential [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) due to the greater degree of euphoric [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and the [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) it can lead to. However, the effects are reported to largely converge with those of [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) after a certain dose-point, when the [dissociating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) effects come to dominate.

It is also often reported to be significantly more stimulating and less sedating than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) while more comfortable than [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) , [MXP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXP) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) and other [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) [reuptake inhibiting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) dissociative compounds which suggests that it may have a higher affinity for [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) or [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - This drug is extremely stimulating in comparison to other dissociatives such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , or [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) . The stimulation it presents is clean and comfortable in a manner which is far closer to that of [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) than that of [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)**
- **[Restless legs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_legs)**
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The body high of this compound can be described in terms of its style variations as a motionless, constant, sharp, all-encompassing, euphoric general activation of nerve endings across the body. This feels halfway between the same sensations induced by [3-MeO-PCP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCP) and [O-PCE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/O-PCE) and disappears at higher doses due to the disconnecting and anesthetic effects it produces.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - At lower to moderate dosages, the sensation itself can be described as feelings of physical comfort, warmth and euphoria which spreads throughout the body. However, at heavier dosages, this sensation becomes neutral or potentially uncomfortable in terms of its enjoyability.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)** - At lower dosages this compound typically induces enhancements in bodily control. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards losses in gross and fine motor control.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** & **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - At lower dosages, this compound tends to induce tactile enhancements. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards tactile suppressions and [anesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) .
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - At lower dosages this compound typically induces enhancements in bodily control. At higher dosages, this enhancement shifts towards losses in gross and fine motor control.
- **[Changes in felt gravity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Changes_in_felt_gravity)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)**
- **[Pain relief](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** - This effect is typically present at the higher doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** - An uncomfortably increased heart rate may become present at heavier dosages but is not noticeable at low to moderate dosages. It tends to become more prominent towards the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of the trip. This effect has been reported as being more pronounced than other dissociatives, such as [DCK](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DCK) or [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) .
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)** - This effect has been reported to be present at heavier dosage levels. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Physical autonomy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_autonomy)**
- **[Olfactory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucinations)**
- **[Optical sliding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Optical_sliding)**
- **[Spatial disorientation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spatial_disorientation)**
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** ### Disconnective effects
 
- - **[Tactile disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_disconnection)**
- **[Visual disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection)** - This eventually results in 3-MeO-PCE's equivalent of the notorious " [k-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-hole) " or, more specifically, *[holes, spaces and voids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Holes.2C_spaces_and_voids)* alongside of *[structures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_disconnection#Structures)* .
- **[Consciousness disconnection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Consciousness_disconnection)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_suppression)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania)** - This effect is reportedly more common on 3-MeO-PCE than most other dissociatives. It typically occurs during the offset of the trip, but can also occur during the onset and come up as well.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)** - Like psychosis, this effect is reportedly more common on 3-MeO-PCE than most other dissociatives. 
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions#Delusions_of_sobriety)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - This effect is more prominent based on the route of administration used. For example, it is especially present when smoked or vaporized, due to the relative abruptness of the substance entering and leaving the bloodstream.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry found within 3-MeO-PCE can be described as very dark and bland when compared to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) or [DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) and often consists of many tiny interlocking and woven lines. It does not extend beyond level 4 and can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as simplistic in complexity, algorithmic in style, synthetic in feel, unstructured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, multicolored in scheme, glossy in shading, soft in edges, small in size, slow in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity.
 
#### Hallucinatory states

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 3-MeO-PCE use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 3-MeO-PCE has very little history of human usage.

### Psychosis

3-MeO-PCE has been reported to cause [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , and [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) at a significantly higher rate than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) such as [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . There are a large number of experience reports online which describe states of "psychotic delirium, amnesia, mania, and other serious consequences" after abusing the substance.

It is strongly recommended that one use extreme caution and [harm reduction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) practices when using this substance.

- Users should avoid using the substance multiple days in a row or becoming addicted to it as this increases the risk of severe adverse effects.
- The recommended dosage range should not be exceeded as high doses can trigger these effects as well.
- Users should start with extremely low doses and work their way up as slowly as possible. [Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) should preferably be used due to the substance's potency; most standard milligram scales cannot accurately weigh out doses below 10-15mg.
- [Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) before one has fully sobered up is not recommended and can result in too high of a dose.

Due to the risk of psychosis, it is not recommended to combine this drug with other substances, especially [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , or other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) like [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of 3-MeO-PCE can be considered highly addictive with a high potential for adverse side effects such as psychosis. In comparison to other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) , 3-MeO-PCE has been reported to be more habit-forming than [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) , [diphenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diphenidine) , [ephenidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephenidine) , and [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) . When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. There have been multiple reports across the internet of people becoming seriously addicted daily users of this substance so serious precautions and considerations should be taken before trying this substance.

Tolerance to many of the effects of 3-MeO-PCE develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 3-MeO-PCE presents cross-tolerance with all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) , meaning that after the use of 3-MeO-PCE, all [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) will have a reduced effect.

### Urinary tract effects

Regarding its long-term health effects when used repeatedly and over excessive periods, 3-MeO-PCE seems to exhibit almost identical bladder and urinary tract problems to those found within [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) , but to a lesser extent. This is because 3-MeO-PCE is far more potent than ketamine, so significantly less of drug needs to be consumed. Symptoms of ketamine-induced cystitis can become severe and can be described as:

- **Urinary frequency** - Urinary frequency is the need to empty the bladder every few minutes.
- **Urinary urgency** - This can be described as a sudden, compelling need to urinate.
- **Urinary pressure** - This is experienced as a constant sensation of fullness in the bladder that is unrelieved by urination.
- **Pelvic and bladder pain** - Pain can develop suddenly and severely, especially since the bladder fills with urine.
- **Hematuria** - Hematuria is visible blood in the urine.
- **Incontinence** - This is the leakage of urine.

All of these, however, can easily be avoided by simply not using 3-MeO-PCE on a daily or even weekly basis and consciously limiting one's usage of the substance.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics)** - This combination is not advised because 3-MeO-PCE has been reported to cause extreme psychological disturbances such as [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and mania at a significantly higher rate than other [dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives) .
- **Stimulants** - Both stimulants and dissociatives carry the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and these risks are exacerbated when the two substances are combined.
- **Depressants** - Because both depress the respiratory system, this combination can result in an increased risk of suddenly falling unconscious, vomiting and choking to death from the resulting suffocation. If [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) or vomiting occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

  "wikipedia": `# 3-MeO-PCE
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-MeO-PCE*

3-Methoxyeticyclidine (3-MeO-PCE), also known as methoxieticyclidine, is a dissociative anesthetic that is qualitatively similar to PCE and PCP and has been sold online as a designer drug.
On October 18, 2012, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in the United Kingdom released a report about methoxetamine, saying that the "harms of methoxetamine are commensurate with Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act (1971)", despite the fact that the act does not classify drugs based on harm. The report went on to suggest that all analogues of methoxetamine should also become class B drugs and suggested a catch-all clause covering both existing and unresearched arylcyclohexamines, including 3-MeO-PCE.
This report also described the receptor binding profile of methoxetamine and three additional dissociatives 3-MeO-PCP, 4-MeO-PCP, and 3-MeO-PCE, showing them to have significant affinity for the PCP site of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) and was later published in more detail.
3-MeO-PCE has Ki values of 61 nM for the NMDAR, 743 nM for the dopamine transporter, 2097 nM for the histamine H2 receptor, 964 nM for the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor, 115 nM for the serotonin transporter, 4519 nM for the σ1 receptor, and 525 nM for the σ2 receptor.

## Legal status

3-MeO-PCE is banned in Sweden and Switzerland.
As per Chile's Ley de drogas, aka Ley 20000, all esters and ethers of PCE are illegal. As 3-MeO-PCE is an ether of PCE, it is thus illegal.
