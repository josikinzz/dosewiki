N-Ethylpentedrone (also known as α-ethylaminopentiophenone, α-EAPP, α-ethylamino-valerophenone, N-ethylnorpentedrone, and NEP) is a chemical compound of the substituted cathinone class. Since the mid-2010s, NEP has been sold online as a designer drug. It is the N-ethyl analog of pentedrone.

## Legal status

NEP is illegal in Japan and China, and is classified as a '"potentially harmful substance"', thus, controlled, but not banned in Sweden and UK.
