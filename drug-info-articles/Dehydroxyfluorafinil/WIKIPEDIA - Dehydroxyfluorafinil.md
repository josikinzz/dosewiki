Modafiendz, also known as N-methyl-4,4-difluoromodafinil or as N-methylbisfluoromodafinil, is a wakefulness-promoting agent related to modafinil that was never marketed. It is sold online and used non-medically as a nootropic (cognitive enhancer).
Modafiendz is the bis-fluoro and N-methylated derivative of modafinil as well as the N-methyl analogue of flmodafinil (CRL-40,940; bisfluoromodafinil) and fladrafinil (CRL-40,941; bisfluoroadrafinil).
Modafinil and its analogues have been found to act as selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors and this is thought to be involved in their wakefulness-promoting effects.
