25E-NBOMe, also known as 2C-E-NBOMe or NBOMe-2C-E, is a derivative of the phenethylamine 2C-E. It acts in a similar manner to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe, which are potent agonists at the 5-HT2A receptor. 25E-NBOMe has been sold as a drug and produces similar effects in humans to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe.

## Use and effects

The dose range of 25E-NBOMe has been given as 0.1 to 1.0 mg sublingually, with a typical dose estimate of 0.3 mg.

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxic and cardiotoxic actions

### Emergency treatment

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

25E-NBOMe acts as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. In accordance with its psychedelic effects in humans, it produces the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents.
25E-NBOMe has shown reinforcing effects in rodents. This included conditioned place preference (CPP) and self-administration. The reinforcing effects of 25E-NBOMe were mediated by increased dopaminergic signaling in the nucleus accumbens. Blockade of the dopamine D1 receptor could attenuate the CPP induced by 25E-NBOMe.

## History

25E-NBOMe was first described in the scientific literature by 2012.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Sweden

Sweden's public health agency classified 25E-NBOMe as a narcotic substance, on January 18, 2019.

#### United Kingdom

This substance is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the N-benzylphenethylamine catch-all clause in the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.
