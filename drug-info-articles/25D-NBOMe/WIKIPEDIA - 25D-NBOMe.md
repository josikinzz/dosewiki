25D-NBOMe, also known as NBOMe-2C-D and "divination", is a derivative of the phenethylamine derived hallucinogen 2C-D. It acts in a similar manner to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe, which is a potent agonist at the 5-HT2A receptor. 25D-NBOMe has been sold as a street drug since 2010 and produces similar effects in humans to related compounds such as 25I-NBOMe and 25C-NBOMe. It was banned as a Temporary Class Drug in the UK on 10 June 2013 after concerns about its recreational use.

The dose range of 25D-NBOMe has been given as 0.3 to 1.2 mg or more sublingually, with a typical dose estimate of 1.0 mg.
