Desomorphine (Krokodil)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
Krokodil is a street name that refers to desomorphine, a semi-synthetic opioid commonly synthesized from [codeine](https://erowid.org/pharms/codeine/codeine.shtml) . Desomorphine's effects are similar to [heroin](https://erowid.org/chemicals/heroin/heroin.shtml) or [oxycodone and include euphoria, sedation, pain relief, and suppression of the body's natural drive to breathe. Codeine is converted into desomorphine to increase potency and make the resulting drug more euphoric. [ Main Desomorphine Vault ]](https://erowid.org/pharms/oxycodone/oxycodone.shtml)
 
Dose #
 
Krokodil is commonly used orally or injected as an impure liquid. The dose varies widely based on the purity of the substance and the tolerance of the user. In early human studies of pure desomorphine, the effects of 1 mg were approximately equivalent to the effects of 10 mg of morphine when the substances were injected under the skin. 1
 
Price #
 
In 2011, anecdotal reports from Russia suggest that 10 tablets of over-the-counter codeine with acetaminophen could be purchased for 120 Russian Rubles or \$3.71 USD. This quantity was said to produce enough desomorphine to substitute for 500 Rubles or \$15.46 USD worth of heroin. 2 Although there are reports of street desomorphine appearing in the United States, we do not have reliable price information.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/desomorphine_law.shtml) #
 
Desomorphine is a Schedule I drug under the United States Code (USC) Title 21 Controlled Substance Act. Desomorphine is also controlled internationally under Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.
 
Chemistry #
 
Desomorphine is an opioid analog with a chemical structure similar to morphine. The structural differences produce a more rapid onset and shorter duration of action than morphine. Desomorphine salts are most commonly injected and are highly soluble in water. The solubility of desomorphine freebase in water is 1425 mg/L at 25 degrees C. 3 It is soluble in acetone and ethyl acetate and appears dark red when dissolved in alcohol solutions. 4 The pKa1 of the amine is 9.69. 5 
 
 In Moscow, analytical labs have found a number of different chemicals in street krokodil: Desomorphine (Morphinan-3-ol, 4,5-epoxy-17-methyl-, (5alpha)-); Tropicamide (N-Ethyl-3-hydroxy-2-phenyl-N-(4-pyridinylmethyl) propanamide); 6-desoxycodeine (Morphinan-3-ol, x,y-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-3-O-methyl-17-methyl-); 6-desoxymorphine (Morphinan-3-ol, x,y-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-17-methyl-); Metamizole/Analgin ([(1,5-Dimethyl-3-oxo-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylamino]methanesulfonic acid, sodium salt). 12
 
Pharmacology #
 
There is incomplete data regarding the pharmacology of desomorphine. The reported effects of desomorphine and the structural similarity to morphine suggest that desomorphine is a potent mu opioid agonist. 
 
 In 1942, a study was conducted comparing the effects of 1 mg desomorphine to 10 mg morphine injected subcutaneously in 902 patients with cancer. Pain relief averaged 2 hours and 25 minutes in the 126 patients that received desomorphine and 3 hours and 7 minutes in the 776 patients that received morphine. 1
 
Production & Synthesis #
 
Clandestine manufacture of desomorphine involves two steps: the extraction of codeine from pharmacuetical products, followed by the synthesis of desomorphine from the codeine. The extraction of codeine involves mixing the codeine source (which often contains acetaminophen and other substances) with organic solvents such as gasoline, adding a strong base such as lye and then adding an acidic solution such as hydrochloric acid to produce water soluble codeine salts that will reside in the aqueous layer. The codeine can be further extracted but many will proceed directly with the next step. The extracted codeine is mixed with iodine, hydrochloric acid, and red phosphorus to reduce the codeine to desocodeine. Subsequently the desocodeine is demethylated itto desomorphine in a one-pot synthesis that may take 45 minutes. There are some reports of attempts at neutralization at the end of the reaction using cigarette ash or sodium bicarbonate. Despite these efforts the solution is often quite acidic with a pH less than 3. 2 Analysis of Russian samples shows that what is purported to be desomorphine is often a sloppy mixture of 4 synthetic analogues of desomorphine, codeine, and other chemicals resulting from poor synthesis procedures. The actual desomorphine content of krokodil samples ranged from traces to 75%. 6
 
History #
 
Desomorphine was first patented in 1932 in the United States as a derivative of morphine. It gained international attention in 2010 when Russian news sources reported an outbreak of severe medical cases resulting from intravenous injection of impure street Krokodil. Reports of use in Russia date back to at least 2003. 8
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Desomorphine, krokodil, crocodile.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/desomorphine_effects.shtml) #
 
The effects of desomorphine are similar to the other opiates. Positive effects often include euphoria, sedation, and analgesia (relief of pain). Common negative effects include constipation, nausea and vomiting, itching, urinary retention, decreased libido, and respiratory depression. Neutral reactions include constriction of the pupils (miosis), flushing, and a pins-and-needles feeling (parathesia). Serious medical complications can include respiratory failure, allergic reactions, seizures, and physical and psychological dependency, which can all lead to death. When impure or acidic desomorphine is injected, it can cause pain, skin discoloration, and additional serious medical problems.
 
Onset #
 
When injected intravenously, the effects can be felt within seconds to minutes. When taken orally, effects take between 15 and 90 minutes to begin, based on experience and stomach contents.
 
Duration #
 
Like other opiates, when injected intravenously, a rapid euphoria is produced followed by a longer period of sedation lasting approximately 2-3 hours.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Desomorphine is not known to cause any visual effects outside of those associated with simple sedation and drowsiness.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive.
- Opioids should not be mixed with other opioids, any sedative, or with any central nervous system depressant because those combinations can increase the risk of death.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Desomorphine has been shown to have a greater addictive potential than morphine. 7 The rapid onset of action produces an intense "rush" that is both pleasurable and drives many users to compulsively use and abuse the substance in a manner similar to heroin. 
 
 Repeated administration of any opiate can cause physical dependency, which requires increasing doses to produce the desired effect and a withdrawal syndrome if the substance is no longer taken.
 
Long Term Health Problems #
 
Desomorphine, when produced in clandestine home labs is notoriously impure and contaminated with toxic substances. Injection can cause immediate damage and destruction of skin, blood vessels, muscles and bone. Iodine used in the synthesis process can cause thyroid and muscle damage. Phosphorus, also a contaminant, is known to damage cartilage. The damaged tissue is susceptible to infection, which may lead to abscesses, inflammation and destruction of the veins (thrombophlebitis), and death of the soft tissue. The constellation of related tissue damage has lead many media reports to refer to desomorphine as a "flesh eating" or "flesh rotting" drug. 9 10 Pure desomorphine itself is not known to cause these effects. Intravenous injection of street krokodil is also well known to cause life threatening blood stream infections, destruction of the heart valves, and death. Because desomorphine is short acting compared to morphine and heroin, the need for more frequent injection increases the risks of infection from Hepatitis C Virus and HIV. 8
 
Risk of Death #
 
As with most opioids, death can occur at high doses because of respiratory depression. Street desomorphine carries additional potentially fatal risks associated with injecting impure chemicals into the body.

**Desomorphine** (also known as **Dihydrodesoxymorphine** ) is an [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) substance of the [morphinan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphinan) chemical class that produces [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) , [muscle-relaxing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , and [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is a structural analog of [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) and the psychoactive component of the mixture known as **Krokodil** (also known as **Crocodile** , **Krok** , or **Croc** ).

Developed by Roche in the 1930s, desomorphine first saw use in Switzerland under the trade name **Permonid** . It was described as having a fast onset, a short duration of action, relatively little nausea, and analgesic potency 8 to 10 times higher than morphine. Concerns about its dependence and abuse potential stemming from these properties led it to fall out of clinical use.

Desomorphine first emerged in the Russian drug scene around 2003 under the term **Krokodil** . The name is a reference to the scaly, green-black skin discoloration frequently noted in its users. Its use and prevalence has been attributed to widespread availability of codeine tablets as inexpensive over-the-counter drugs, along with a simple production process that can be done in a kitchen laboratory using iodine, red phosphorus, paint thinner, and hydrochloric acid.

The application of krokodil regularly induces immediate damage to blood vessels, muscles, and bone and can induce multiple organ failure. These severe complications are, however, caused by the toxic byproducts of the home production process rather than desomorphine itself.

It should be noted that the scientific coverage of Krokodil is lacking and most of the knowledge concerning krokodil is based on media coverage. A small number of cases involving krokodil use outside of Russia, including Germany and the United States, have been reported but have failed to be substantiated. As of 2018, the only confirmed reports of krokodil use are from Russia.

## History and culture

Desomorphine was first synthesized and patented in the United States in 1932. It was originally synthesized with the intention to create an alternative to morphine in terms of tolerance and addiction properties and improve the side effect profile. However, desomorphine fell short of these expectations and showed an increased dependence potential compared with morphine.

Desomorphine was used in Switzerland and introduced to the Swiss market in 1940 by the company Hoffman-La Roche, under the registered trade name of **Permonid** . It was used predominantly for postoperative pain due to its fast onset of action and reduced the tendency to cause respiratory depression and nausea. Toward the end of 1952, Permonid was withdrawn from the market. Notably, the production of Permonid was continued in Switzerland until 1981 due to the idiosyncratic analgesic needs of a single patient in Bern, Switzerland, who suffered from a rare disease.

In Russia, krokodil is considered an inexpensive and highly addictive substitute for heroin. Its name is derived from crocodile (krokodil in Russian) and refers to the scaly, green-black skin discoloration frequently noted in its users. Krokodil is produced by synthesizing desomorphine from codeine and combining it with other low-cost, easily obtained additives. These additives can include hydrochloric acid, red phosphorus (from matchbook striking surfaces), iodine, gasoline, and paint thinner and have been proposed to underly krokodil's severe skin and systemic effects. This production process is similar to that used to make street methamphetamine.

Since 2003, the prevalence of krokodil use in Russia has been increasing rapidly, presumably as a consequence of its low cost and its high dependence potential.

## Chemistry

Desomorphine, a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, is an opioid of the morphinan class. Dorphine and other molecules of this class contain a polycyclic core of three benzene rings fused in a zig-zag pattern called phenanthrene. A fourth nitrogen-containing ring is fused to the phenanthrene at R 9 and R 13 with the nitrogen member looking at R 17 of the combined structure. This structure is called morphinan.

Desomorphine (along with other morphinans) contains an ether bridge between two of its rings, connecting R 4 and R 5 through an oxygen group. It contains one hydroxy group (OH-), bound at R 3 , and a methyl group located on the nitrogen atom at R 17 . It chemically differs from morphine with regard to the absent secondary hydroxy group at R 6 and the saturated double bond.

## Pharmacology

he drug can be made from codeine and iodine derived from over-the-counter medications and red phosphorus from match strikers, in a process similar to the manufacturing of methamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. Like methamphetamine, desomorphine made this way is often contaminated with various agents. The street name in Russia for homemade desomorphine is **krokodil** (Russian: крокодил, crocodile), possibly related to the chemical name of the precursor α-chlorocodide, or the resemblance of the skin damage caused by the drug to a crocodile's leather.

Desomorphine is a morphine analogue where the 6-hydroxyl group and the 7,8 double bond have been reduced. The traditional synthesis of desomorphine starts from α-chlorocodide, which is itself obtained by treating thionyl chloride with codeine. By catalytic reduction, α-chlorocodide gives dihydrodesoxycodeine, which yields desomorphine on demethylation.

Like other opiates, desomorphine exerts its effects by binding to and activating the [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) as an [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) . This occurs due to the way in which opioids functionally mimic the body's natural endorphins. Endorphins are responsible for analgesia (pain reduction), sleepiness, and feelings of pleasure and enjoyment. They can be released in response to pain, strenuous exercise, orgasm, or excitement. This mimicking of natural endorphins results in the drug's [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) , [analgesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pain_relief) (pain relief), and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) (anti-anxiety) effects.

## Subjective effects

Due to a lack of anecdotal reports using high purity desomorphine, the following effects are extrapolated from early clinical reports and inferences based on its relation to [codeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Codeine) and [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) . Desomorphine is considered to be powerfully euphoric opiate analgesia, with a fast onset and shorter duration that can encourage compulsive usage.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Toxicity of desomorphine

Like most opioids, unadulterated desomorphine does not cause many long-term complications other than dependence and constipation. Outside of the extremely powerful addiction and physical dependence potential, the harmful or toxic aspects of desomorphine usage are exclusively associated with not taking appropriate precautions in regards to its administration, overdosing and using impure products derived from low-quality black-market self-manufacture.

Animal studies comparing pure desomorphine to morphine showed it to have increased toxicity, more potent relief of pain, higher levels of sedation, decreased respiration, and increased digestive activity

Heavy dosages of desomorphine can result in [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , leading to fatal or dangerous levels of anoxia (oxygen deprivation). This occurs because the breathing reflex is suppressed by [agonism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonists) of [µ-opioid receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid_receptors) proportional to the dosage consumed.

Desomorphine can also cause nausea and vomiting; a significant number of deaths attributed to opioid overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious victim. This is when an unconscious or semi-conscious user who is lying on their back vomits into their mouth and unknowingly suffocates. It can be prevented by ensuring that one is lying on their side with their head tilted downwards so that the airways cannot be blocked in the event of vomiting while unconscious (also known as the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) ).

### Toxicity of "krokodil"

Illicitly produced desomorphine is typically far from pure and often contains large amounts of toxic substances as a result of being "cooked" and used without any significant effort to remove the byproducts and leftovers from synthesis. Injecting any such mixture can cause serious damage to the skin, blood vessels, bone, and muscles, sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users.

Causes of this damage include iodine, phosphorus, and leftover solvents like gasoline and paint-thinner that are not adequately removed after synthesis. Strong acids and bases such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are also employed without measuring pH of the final solution. Failure to remove insoluble fillers and binding aids from the codeine tablets used as starting material, as well as co-administration with pharmaceuticals such as tropicamide and tianeptine , are also cited as possible contributors to the high toxicity observed in users.

The frequent occurrence of tissue damage and infection among illicit users are what gained the drug its nickname of the "flesh-eating drug." The pure form of the drug itself does not cause this damage. Despite the severe health impacts and short survival times commonly reported, there are also rarer cases of krokodil users more skilled in the manufacturing process who have used the drug for many years without experiencing the tissue damage associated with the impure "street" product.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other opiate-based painkillers, the chronic use of desomorphine can be considered extremely addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of desomorphine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. The rate at which this occurs develops at different rates for different effects with tolerance to the euphoric effects growing most quickly. Desomorphine presents cross-tolerance with all other [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) , meaning that after the consumption of desomorphine all [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) will have a reduced effect.

### Overdose

Depending on drug interactions and numerous other factors, death from overdose can take anywhere from several minutes to several hours. Death usually occurs due to lack of oxygen resulting from the lack of breathing. Many fatalities reported as opiate overdoses are probably caused by interactions with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as alcohol or benzodiazepines. It should also be noted that since opiates can cause nausea and vomiting, a significant number of deaths attributed to opiate overdose are caused by aspiration of vomit by an unconscious person.

The risk of fatal opioid overdoses rise sharply after a period of cessation and relapse, largely because of reduced tolerance. To account for this lack of tolerance, it is safer to only dose a fraction of one's usual [dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage) if relapsing. It has also been found that the environment one is in can play a role in opioid tolerance. In one scientific study, rats with the same history of heroin administration were significantly more likely to die after receiving their dose in an environment not associated with the drug in contrast to a familiar environment.

Opiate overdose is usually treated with an [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) , such as naloxone (Narcan). This reverses the effects of opioids like desomorphine and causes an immediate return of consciousness but may result in withdrawal symptoms. The half-life of naloxone is shorter than most opioids, so it may have to be administered multiple times until the body has metabolized the opioid.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) and [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) caused by each other and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desomorphine*

Desomorphine (or in some formulations known as Krokodil) is a semi-synthetic opioid commercialized by Roche, with powerful, fast-acting effects, such as sedation and analgesia. It was first discovered and patented in Germany by a German team working for Knoll in 1920 but was not generally recognized. It was later synthesized in 1932 by American chemist Lyndon Frederick Small. Small also successfully patented it in 1934 in the United States. Desomorphine was used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland under the brand name Permonid and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea compared to equivalent doses of morphine. Dose for dose it is roughly ten times more potent than morphine, with 1 mg desomorphine being equivalent 10 mg morphine, via the intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) routes.
Desomorphine is a morphine analogue where the 6-hydroxyl group and the 7,8 double bond have been reduced. The traditional synthesis of desomorphine starts from α-chlorocodide, which is itself obtained by treating codeine with thionyl chloride. By catalytic reduction, α-chlorocodide gives dihydrodesoxycodeine, which yields desomorphine on demethylation.
A desomorphine product, usually based on codeine, has been developed as a recreational drug. The product in question is typically a highly impure variant of desomorphine. The scaly sores and necrosis that develop around the injection site has prompted the name krokodil (Russian for crocodile).

## Uses

### Medical

Desomorphine was previously used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland for the treatment of severe pain. While medical usage of desomorphine was terminated in 1981, during the final years leading up to that it was being used to treat a single patient in Bern, Switzerland with a rare illness. While desomorphine was found to be faster acting and more effective than morphine for the rapid relief of severe pain, its shorter duration of action and the relatively more severe respiratory depression produced at equianalgesic doses, as well as a high incidence of other side effects such as hypotension and urinary retention, were felt to outweigh any potential advantages.

### Recreational

Desomorphine abuse in Russia attracted international attention in 2010 due to an increase in clandestine production, presumably due to its relatively simple synthesis from codeine available over the counter. Abuse of homemade desomorphine was first reported in Siberia in 2003 when Russia started a major crackdown on heroin production and trafficking, but has since spread throughout Russia and the neighboring former Soviet republics.
The drug can be made from codeine and iodine derived from over-the-counter medications and red phosphorus from match strikers, in a process similar to the manufacturing of methamphetamine from pseudoephedrine. Like methamphetamine, desomorphine made this way is often contaminated with various agents. The street name in Russia for homemade desomorphine is krokodil (Russian: крокодил, crocodile), possibly related to the chemical name of the precursor α-chlorocodide, or the resemblance of the skin damage caused by the drug to a crocodile's leather. Due to difficulties in procuring heroin, combined with easy and cheap access to over-the-counter pharmacy products containing codeine in Russia, use of krokodil increased until 2012. In 2012 the Russian federal government introduced new restrictions for the sale of codeine-containing medications. This policy change diminished but did not extinguish krokodil use in Russia. It has been estimated that around 100,000 people use krokodil in Russia and around 20,000 in Ukraine. One death in Poland in December 2011 was also believed to have been caused by krokodil use, and its use has been confirmed among Russian expatriate communities in other European countries. In 2013 two cases of Krokodil use were reported in the United States. A single case of oral desomorphine use was reported in Spain in 2014. There are reports of krokodil use in the United Kingdom.

## Adverse effects

### Toxicity

#### Toxicity of desomorphine

Animal studies comparing pure desomorphine to morphine showed it to have increased toxicity, more potent relief of pain, higher levels of sedation, decreased respiration, and increased digestive activity.

#### Toxicity of krokodil

Illicitly produced desomorphine is typically far from pure and often contains large amounts of toxic substances and contaminants as a result of the drug producers neglecting to remove highly toxic reactants and solvents left over from synthesis. This neglect could be due to the producers having a limited understanding of chemistry or as a way to avoid the costs of extracting the toxic material. Injecting any such mixture can cause serious damage to the skin, blood vessels, bone, and muscles, sometimes requiring limb amputation in long-term users. This highly impure product may have received the name of krokodil due to the dire effects of the body which can readily be noticed.
Causes of this damage are associated with iodine, phosphorus and other toxic substances that are present after synthesis. Desomorphine producers would use cheap, readily available but relatively toxic and impure solvents such as battery acid, gasoline or paint thinner during the reaction scheme, without adequately removing them afterwards before distribution. Strong acids and bases such as hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide are also employed without measuring the pH of the final solution, and analysis of leftover solutions of "krokodil" in used syringes showed the pH was typically less than 3 (i.e. as acidic as lemon juice). Failure to remove insoluble fillers and binding aids from the codeine tablets used as starting material, as well as co-administration with pharmaceuticals such as tropicamide and tianeptine, are also cited as possible contributors to the high toxicity observed in users.
The frequent occurrence of tissue damage and infection among illicit users are what gained the drug its nickname of the flesh-eating drug, or the zombie drug, as homemade versions made under inadequate conditions contain multiple impurities and toxic substances that lead to severe tissue damage and subsequent infection as a direct consequence of use.
Gangrene, phlebitis, thrombosis (blood clots), pneumonia, meningitis, septicaemia (blood infection), osteomyelitis (bone infection), liver and kidney damage, brain damage, and HIV/AIDS are common serious adverse health effects observed among users of krokodil. Sometimes, the user will miss the vein when injecting the desomorphine, creating an abscess and causing death of the flesh surrounding the entry-point.

### Reinforcement disorders

Abuse potential studies of desomorphine in animals 
had shown that it exhibited limited addiction liability. In monkeys, desomorphine had 10 times the depressant effect of morphine, developed tolerance less rapidly and less completely, and did not lead to the appearance of abstinence symptoms during withdrawal. Studies in rats receiving a daily injection of desomorphine at a constant 
dose showed they slowly developed tolerance to the depressant effect of desomorphine.

## Chemistry

Desomorphine has a molecular weight of 271.35 g/mol and three salts are known: hydrobromide (as in the original Permonid brand; free-base conversion ratio 0.770), hydrochloride (0.881) and sulfate (0.802). Its freebase form is slightly soluble in water (1.425 g/L at 25 °C), although its salts are very water-soluble; its freebase form is also very soluble in most polar organic solvents (like acetone, ethanol and ethyl acetate). Its melting point is 189 °C. It has a pKa of 9.69. Desomorphine comes in four isoforms, A, B, C, and D and the latter two appear to be the more researched and used.
Krokodil is made from codeine mixed with other substances. The codeine is retrieved from over-the-counter medicine and is then mixed with ethanol, gasoline, red phosphorus, iodine, hydrochloric acid and paint thinner (a mixture of aliphatic C7 to C12 hydrocarbons, either open-chain or alicyclic). Toxic nitrogen oxide fumes emerge from the drug when heated.

## History

Desomorphine was first discovered and patented in Germany by a German team working for Knoll in 1920. Desomorphine was later synthesised in the U.S. in 1932 and patented on 13 November 1934. In Russia, desomorphine was declared an illegal narcotic analgesic in 1998. However, while codeine-containing drugs generally have been prescription products in Europe, in Russia they were sold freely over the counter until June 2012. The number of users in Russia was estimated to have reached around one million at the peak of the drug's popularity.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

In the US, desomorphine is a Schedule 1 controlled substance, indicating that the United States FDA has determined that there are no legal medicinal uses for desomorphine in the United States. It has maintained this status as a controlled substance since 1936. The drug is a Narcotic in Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act 1970 of the United States as drug number (ACSCN) 9055. It is therefore subject to annual aggregate manufacturing quotas in the United States, and in 2014 the quota for desomorphine was 5 grams. It is produced as a hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.85) and sulphate (0.80).

### North American media

Media in the U.S. and Canada have brought awareness to desomorphine. There have been incidents reported where desomorphine had supposedly been present within either country, but no incidents have been confirmed by any drug testing or analytical results, and desomorphine use in North America is still considered unconfirmed.
