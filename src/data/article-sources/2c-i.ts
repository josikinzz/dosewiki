**2C-I** or **2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine** is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. It was described in Shulgin’s 1991 book PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. The drug is used recreationally for its psychedelic and entactogenic effects and is sometimes confused for the analog 25I-NBOMe. 2C-I is commonly sold in its hydrochloride salt form, which is a fluffy, sparkling, white powder, which can sometimes be pressed into tablet form. 2C-I has been explored as a potential stimulant nootropic in doses between 1-8mg.

In terms of its chemistry, 2C-I is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups attached carbons R2 and R5 as well as an iodine molecule attached to carbon R4. It is thought to have efficacy at the 5-HT2A receptor as a partial agonist.

The 2C-I experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe.**
**

**Physical effects:**

The physical effects of 2C-I can be broken down into five components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of 2C-I is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. Alongside of this, many users commonly report that the body high can be particularly uncomfortable and sometimes accompanied by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one’s body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups.
- **Euphoria** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common and very pleasurable. These move from the top of the head downwards before envoloping ones whole body.
- **Stimulation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, 2C-I is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to that of MDMA although encouraged instead of forced.
- **Increased bodily control**
- **Enhancement of touch**
- **Nausea** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the tripper has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **Loss of temperature regulation**
- **Head aches **- Some users report mild but uncomfortable head pressures which can occasionally intensify during the offset of the experience.

**Cognitive effects:**

The head space of 2C-I is described by many as one which is relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high dosages. It is often said to lack insight when compared to that of 2C-E, 2C-B and LSD.
The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes:

- **Increased empathy, love and sociability** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as MDMA and 2C-B but still prove strong enough to provide long lasting therapeutic effects.
- **Time distortion**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Sexual arousal**
- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**

**Visual effects:**

*Enhancements*

2C-I presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally includes:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colour**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

2C-I presents a full and complete array of possible visual distortions which generally includes:

- **Drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as simplistic and bland in detail, slow and smooth but sometimes jittery in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **Tracers**
- **Symmetrical texture repetition **- In comparison to other psychedelics such as LSD and 2C-E this particular effect is bland and simplistic.
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of LSD or 2C-B than that of 2C-E, psilocin, or ayahuasca although it is much more bland and less detailed. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, both soft and sharp in their edges as well as equally rounded and angular in their corners. They seem high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7A visual geometry over Level 7B.

*Hallucinatory states*

Like LSD, while 2C-I is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states, this is extremely rare and inconsistent at higher levels but common at lower and generally includes the following effects:

- **External hallucinations **- The experience of effects such as open eye transformations are common within 2C-I but not consistent.
- **Internal hallucinations** - Although 2C-I is technically capable producing of hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with psilocin or DMT in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as LSA, Ayahuasca and Mescaline will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-I hallucinations will not extend beyond imagery and higher dosages will for most will simply go straight into Level 7A visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that for most, 2C-I is simply not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.

**Auditory effects:**

The auditory effects of 2C-I are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health effects, addiction potential and tolerance:**

The toxicity and long term health effects of recreational 2C-I use does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 2C-I is a research chemical with very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried 2C-I within the psychedelic community suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying this drug at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-I use. Using 2C-I two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day. However, this effect is nearly non-existent when spaced 5-7 days apart.

**Legal issues:**

- **European Union:** In December 2003, the European Council issued a binding order compelling all EU member states to ban 2C-I within three months.
- **Denmark:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Germany:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Greece:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Ireland:** The drug is a controlled substance.
- **Italy:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Netherlands:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Poland:** It is a controlled substance.
- **Sweden:** Sveriges riksdag added 2C-I to schedule I (“substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use”) as narcotics in Sweden as of March 16, 2004.
- **United Kingdom:** It is controlled as a Class A substance.
- **USA:** As of July 9, 2012, in the United States, 2C-I is a Schedule I substance under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal.

**Conclusion:**

2C-I is a worthwhile experience but is not as deep as other drugs of the same family. It is a substance which works better for some than others. For example, while many find it to be extremely uncomfortable others find it perfect for recreational use in public and social environments.

## Subjective Experience

First synthesised by Alexander Shulgin in 1976, 2C-I began to emerge as a popular
recreational drug in the late 1990’s. Sometimes confused with 2C-I-NBOMe and
dubbed with the name Smiles by the media, it was no surprise when it was scheduled
in the United States in 2012. It had already been classified in the UK in 1998.

My sample came in the form of an 18mg pill, reputedly sourced from China and
pressed in the UK. I tested it on a swelteringly hot summer’s day; the sort of day on
which it is difficult to escape the background heat. This was one of the reasons I went
low with the dose: uncomfortable body load could well be multiplied in such
conditions.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I weigh the pill and then break it into pieces, accumulating 9mg on
the scales. I swig the crumbled debris down with spring water. The operation
isn’t particularly clean and I catch the unpleasantness of the taste and
constitution of the pill at the back of my throat. [15:20]
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:20 Only the mildest of mental stimulation is apparent, but I do feel a
little more comfortable with the conditions.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 The hazy headspace has only developed a little, but there is now a
light sheen to vision.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 There is a sweaty touchy feel to this, with the familiar dreamy 2C type
of mindset, which is quite smooth, although unexciting. Rationality is fully
maintained, although as is often the case with 2C’s, concentration upon
specific external factors or subject matter can be heightened from time to
time.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I hesitate to use the word comfortable again, but that is the general vibe as I
walk around. There are no real visuals to report.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:15 This is quite a physical experience: sentient, clammy hands, with horn
available. The headspace is now more solid and the sheen on my vision has
strengthened, but not into any definable OEVs or CEVs.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is quite pleasant at this point. I notice that my pupils are semi-dilated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I have been on a plateau for some time. This will clearly go no further.
It is stable with the mild dreamy mood and the tactile body warmth.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:00 I have now started to slide down the gears. The gentle psychedelic
headiness remains, as does the warmth and sensuality, but at increasingly
lower levels.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+5:00 I bathe in the afterglow, with the dying embers of enhanced
colouration and the soft landing of the head and body high flowing down
towards base.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
With certain senses enhanced and anxieties chased away a walk into suburbia
becomes a genuine pleasure.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I retire to bed at 11:30pm, eight hours after initial ingestion.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+16:00 I drifted off fairly quickly and the night’s sleep was a good one. This
morning I feel completely normal.
\`\`\`
Overall, on this dose this was a fairly mild and pleasant experience. It didn’t have the
depth of, for example, 2C-E, or indeed, a great deal of excitement, but for a gentle
afternoon sojourn it was positive and enjoyable.

For a fully engaged psychedelic ride I suspect that the consensus, of a dose of
perhaps 12-15mg, is probably about right.

2C-I
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
2C-I is a phenethylamine somewhat similar in effects to 2C-B. It became available on the grey markets in 2002, but distribution dropped off after a series of [DEA busts in 2004](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) and the prosecutions of vendors selling research chemicals for recreational use. It is available primarily in powder form--though some pressed tablets have been seen--and is generally taken orally. 
 
[ [Main 2C-I Vault](https://erowid.org/2ci.shtml) ]
 
[Dose](https://erowid.org/2ci_dose.shtml) #
 
A standard oral dose of 2C-I is between 10-25 mg. Recent reports suggest that 2C-I is just slightly more potent than 2C-B (slightly less material needed for the same level of effects).
 
Price #
 
2C-I is sold at \$300-500 USD per gram retail, and \$50-200 USD per gram wholesale (2011).
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/2ci_law.shtml) #
 
2C-I is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States meaning that possession or distribution without a DEA license is illegal. It became controlled under federal law in the US in 2012. 2C-I is scheduled in Germany and Denmark, but not in the European Union (EU).
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/2ci_chemistry.shtml) #
 
2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Iodophenethylamine (2C-I) is a synthetic chemical phenethylamine related structurally to 2C-B.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
The bulk of available 2C-I is primarily produced by experienced chemists in commercial labs.
 
History #
 
2C-I first gained public awareness after the publication of PiHKAL by Alexander & Ann Shulgin.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
2C-I.
 
The Experience:
 
Tripping.
 
EFFECTS #
 
Onset #
 
Depending on how much and how recently the user has eaten, oral 2C-I takes between 45-75 minutes to take effect. On a full stomach, onset can be considerably slower.
 
Duration #
 
The primary effects of 2C-I last approximately 5-8 hours when taken orally.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Problems Summary Needed.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take 2C-I if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorix or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). 2C-I and MAOIs are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI. Do not operate heavy machinery. Do Not Drive. Individuals currently in the midst of emotional or psychological upheaval in their everyday lives should be careful about choosing to use psychedelics such as 2C-I as they can trigger even more difficulty. Individuals with a family history of schizophrenia or early onset mental illness should be extremely careful because psychedelics have been known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
2C-I is neither physically addicting nor likely to cause psychological dependance. Withdrawal effects following discontinuation have not been reported. As with most substances, some people will use it more frequently than they are comfortable with. There is a short period of tolerance after 2C-I use. Using 2C-I two days in a row is likely to lead to a diminished experience the second day, though spaced 5-7 or more days apart, this effect is nearly non-existent.

E.U. #
 
EU Council published an order on Dec 6 2003, asking all member states to control 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, and TMA-2 within 90. See [Final Rule here](https://erowid.org/../2ci/2ci_law2.shtml) . This binding order went against a non-binding EU Commission's recommendation from earlier in 2003. The Commission did not recommend controlling these chemicals because of lack of evidence of problems: [Commission of the European Communities : Report from the Comission to the Council : TMA-2, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, and 2C-T-7](https://erowid.org/../2ci/2ci_info1.shtml) .

## SYNTHESIS
To a solution of 12.9 g N-(2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethyl)phthalimide in 130 mL warm (35 Â°C) acetic acid which was being vigorously stirred, there was added a solution of 10 g iodine monochloride in 40 mL acetic acid. This was stirred for 1 h, while being held at about 30 Â°C. The reaction mixture was poured into 1500 mL H2O and extracted with 4Ã75 mL CH2Cl2. The extracts were pooled, washed once with 150 mL H2O containing 2.0 g sodium dithionite, and the solvent removed under vacuum to give 16.2 g of N-(2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)ethyl)phthalimide as yellow amber solids with a mp of 133â141 Â°C. This mp was improved by recrystallization from 75 mL CH3CN, yielding 12.2 g of a pale yellow solid with mp 149â151 Â°C. A small sample from a large quantity of IPA gives a white product melting at 155.5â157 Â°C.

A solution of 12.2 g N-(2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)ethyl)phthalimide in 150 mL hot IPA was treated with 6.0 mL of hydrazine hydrate, and the clear solution was heated on the steam bath. After a few minutes there was the generation of a white cottage cheese-like solid (1,4-dihydroxyphthalizine). The heating was continued for several additional h, the reaction mixture cooled, and the solids removed by filtration. These were washed with 2Ã10 mL EtOH, and the pooled filtrate and washes stripped of solvent under vacuum giving a residue which, when treated with aqueous hydrochloric acid, gave 3.43 g of voluminous white crystals. This, after recrystallization from 2 weights of H2O, filtering, washing first with IPA and then with Et2O, and air drying, gave 2.16 g 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine hydrochloride (2C-I) as a white microcrystalline solid, with a mp of 246â247 Â°C. Anal. (C10H15ClINO2) C,H,N.

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
Erowid received several requests for clarification of this note. Alexander Shulgin confirmed that this experience was a contact-high from being near a group of people on 2C-I. He writes:

I realize that some readers think that Ann and I are the authors  of all the commentaries but in reality they have come from many  different authors.

I have dug around in my notes and have finally found the  origin of the zero milligram comment. It was a group experiment  with 2C-I. Two members of the group arrived after everyone else had started and decided not to make a late entry, simply enjoy being observers. They reported that one of them turned on almost immediately, and went up to a plus two and a half. Further into his research notes he  wrote that he had âabsorbed the ambience of the folks who had  actually imbibed the material,â and this was transferred directly  to PiHKAL. I hoped that this would make it obvious that it was a  contact high, not a drug-induced high.

Alexander Shulgin, October 2004

[Erowid] hopes that clarifies the issue.

(with 15 mg) âComfortable onset. Most notable are the visuals, patterning like 2C-B (Persian carpet type), very colorful and active. Much more balanced emotional character, but still no feeling of insight, revelation, or progress toward the true meaning of the universe. And at 5 1/2 hours drop-off very abrupt, then gentle decline. I would like to investigate museum levels.â

(with 16 mg) âThere was an immediate alert within minutes. As usual, it was only an awareness, then nothing happened for a while. In retrospect, I see some type of activity or awareness within 40 minutes, which then builds up over time. The peak was at 2 hours and seemed to maintain itself for a while. Near the peak, there was some hallucinogenic activity, though not a lot. The pictures in the dining room had color and pattern movement that was fairly detailed. Focusing on other areas, such as walls or the outside of the house, produced little activity, though I tried. There was certainly a lot of color enhancement. There was also that peculiar aspect of the visual field having darkened or shadowed areas. These darker areas seemed to shift around to some degree. That aspect seems to be similar to 2C-B. I donât think I was more than +2.5 at the peak. Coming down was uneventful. I was down within 6 hours. I had no problems driving home, nor were there any difficulties with sleep. There were no body problems with this material. I ate like a horse.â

(with 16 mg) âThe 16 was a bit much, I realized, because my body was not sure of what to do with all the energy. Next time Iâll try 14 or 15. However, my conversations were extremely clear and insightful. The degree of honesty was incredible. I was not afraid to say anything to anyone. Felt really good about myself. Very centered, in fact. A bit tired at dayâs end. Early bedtime.â

(with 20 mg) âI think there is slightly less than full immersion in the sensual, with this material, compared with 2C-B, but I suspect itâs more a matter of getting used to the language of 2C-I and the feelingsâgetting tuned to a slightly different frequency, reallyârather than that the material is less sensual or less easy to use sensually. Just different frequency, and we are very, very used to 2C-B. Good on the body. Transition, for me, not as strongly dark as 2C-B. But it could certainly take a lot more exploring, if we were able to give the time (about 9 hours) to it. Next day: sleep excellent. Energy next day unusually good. Quite tired by evening.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
But, on the brighter side of the picture, you have a heavy atom here, and this atom is intrinsic to the central activity of the compound. So, these materials are naturals for radio-labelling experiments. 2C-I has been made radioactive with radio-iodine, but the most impressive findings have been made with the 3-carbon analog, DOI.

One quotation from an observer of a group experiment is enclosed; an experiment with zero milligrams being taken. This is a instructive observation of what has been called a contact high.

There is one Iodotweetio known. In Scrabble, would you challenge a word that had seven of its eleven letters as vowels? Especially if the vowels were, specifically, iooeeio? It sounds just a little like the noise coming out of Old McDonaldâs farm. But a Tweetio there is, namely, the 2-EtO-homologue of 2C-I. This is 2-ethoxy-4-iodo-5-methoxyphenethylamine, or 2CI-2ETO. The hydrochloride salt was a white, crystalline product with a melting point of 175â175.5 Â°C. The threshold level of activity was seen at an oral dose of 5 milligrams, and the generated effects were completely dispersed in a couple of hours. Most interestingly, larger doses, of up to 50 milligrams orally, seem to produce no more intense an effect, but simply to stretch out this threshold for an additional couple of hours. At no level that has been tried, has 2CI-2ETO produced even a plus-two response.

Where else can one go, from 2C-I? The iodine is the fourth, and the last of the so-called halogens, at the bottom of the classical periodic table. But, thanks to the miracles that have accompanied us into the nuclear age, there is a fifth halide now known, Astatine. All of its isotopes are radioactive, however, and it seems unlikely that there will ever be an entry (other than this one) for 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-astatophenethylamine. What might be speculated as to its activity? Probably similar in potency to 2C-I, requiring maybe 10 or 20 milligrams. The duration would be dicey to measure, since the isotope with the longest known half-life is half decayed in about 8 hours, and the longest lived natural isotope (for those who insist on natural rather than man-made things) is half decayed in less than a minute. Two predictions would be pretty solid. You might have quite a job accumulating your 10 milligrams of Astatine, as the most that has so far been made at one time is only about 0.05 micrograms, approximately a millionth of the amount needed. And the second prediction? You would not survive the screaming radiation that would bombard you if you could get the needed 5 or 10 milligrams of radio-astatine onto that magic 4-position, and the resulting 2C-A into your tummy!

**2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine** (also known as **2C-I** and " **Smiles** ") is a [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a member of the [2C-x family](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x_family) of psychedelic phenethylamines, all of which were derived from the systematic modification of the [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) molecule.

2C-I was first synthesized and investigated for human activity by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in 1976 and later described in his 1991 book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved"). Its PiHKAL entry notes it for being "very colorful and active" but without "feelings of insight, revelation, or progress toward the true meaning of the universe." It first briefly gained some popularity in the late 1990s and early 2000s, where it was sold in several smart shops as a replacement for [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) following its scheduling in 1995. It also has a history of being sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) before becoming scheduled.

2C-I is typically used [recreationally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) for its [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) as well as moderate [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects. It has been explored as a potential [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) in the 1-8mg dosage range. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 2C-I, and it has a limited history of human use. 2C-I is sometimes confused for the analog [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) (an abbreviated form of **2C-I-NBOMe** ). It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

2C-I, or 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine, is a substituted [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) comprising a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain. 2C-I contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as an iodine atom attached to carbon R 4 of the phenyl ring. 2C-I belongs to the 2C family of phenethylamines which contain methoxy groups on the 2 and 5 positions of the benzene ring.

## Pharmacology

2C-I is a psychedelic phenethylamine of the 2C-x family. 2C-I is taken orally in tablet or capsule forms or snorted in its powder form. It has also been found impregnated on small squares of blotter paper for oral administration, which is a technique often seen for the distribution and abuse of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . 2C-I primarily causes stimulant and hallucinogenic effects, including increased visual, auditory, and tactile sensations. Moderate doses can cause full hallucinations and can also produce a euphoric high.

2C-I's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience remains the subject of ongoing scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 2C-I is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is quite comparable to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , although it is 'encouraged' instead of 'forced'.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of 2C-I is manifested as one of the most proportionally intense in comparison to almost all of the classical psychedelics. The sensation itself can be described as an intense and slightly uncomfortable energetic pins and needles sensation that constantly encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting, tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves. Alongside this, many users commonly report that the "body high" can be particularly uncomfortable and sometimes accompanied by dysphoric aches and urges to shift the position of one's body and prolonged tensing of unusual combinations of muscle groups. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Feelings of frequent but unpredictable rushes of warm physical euphoria are extremely common. These can move from the top of the head downwards before enveloping one's whole body.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)**
- **[Muscle contractions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_contractions)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)**
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is consistently reported when consumed in moderate to high doses and either passes once the user has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as simplistic and bland in detail, slow and smooth but sometimes jittery in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Environmental cubism](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_cubism)** - This effect is unique in that is it usually manifests simultaneously alongside or directly as a result of [external geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_geometry)
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) than that of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) although it is much blander and less detailed. They can be comprehensively described as unstructured in their organization, algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, both soft and sharp in their edges as well as equally rounded and angular in their corners. They seem high in algorithmic visuals such as fractals and at higher doses are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
Like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , while 2C-I is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states, this is extremely rare and inconsistent at higher levels but common at lower ones.
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Although 2C-I is technically capable of producing hallucinatory states in a fashion that is on par with [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) in its vividness and intensity, in comparison, these effects are extremely rare and inconsistent. Whilst traditional psychedelics such as [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) , [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) and [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) will induce internal hallucinations near consistently at level 5 geometry and above, 2C-I hallucinations will not extend beyond imagery and higher doses will for most simply go straight into [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8A) visual geometry. This lack of consistently induced hallucinatory breakthroughs means that, for most, 2C-I is not as deep of an experience as certain other psychedelics.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The head space of 2C-I is described by many as one which is relatively normal in its thought processes even at moderate to high doses. It is often said to lack insight when compared to that of [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) , [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . 
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, affection and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)** or **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** In contrast to some other psychedelics, this effect does not readily occur except at very high doses.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 2C-I use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 2C-I is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 2C-I suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the substance by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as [volumetric dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_dosing) , when using this substance so as to ensure the accurate administration of the intended dose.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Although no formal studies have been conducted, it is not unreasonable to assume that as is the case with psychedelics in general, 2C-I is not habit-forming and that the desire to use it can actually decrease with use.

Tolerance to the effects of 2C-I is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3-5 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7-10 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 2C-I presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 2C-I all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 2C-I. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Effects
Perceptions and feelings become more intense. From 10-15 mg (snorted already from 7 mg), the effect usually takes on a hallucinogenic character. The boundaries between inside and outside can dissolve. Often moving coloured patterns and luminous fields around objects and persons are perceived. However, the intoxication is felt to be less profound than with LSD.

## Dosage
2C-I is effective even in small doses; even 2 mg more or less can make a big difference in the effect experienced; a gradual approach to the individual dose is recommended. Doses above 35 mg can be experienced as unpleasantly strong even by experienced users.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The pupils dilate, blood pressure rises and nausea, sweating and dizziness may occur. Some users report stomach and intestinal problems, and mild allergic reactions (such as coughing due to increased mucus production) may occur. Disorientation, confusion and feelings of anxiety, even fear of death, are risks on a psychological level.

### Long-term Risks
There are no research results on long-term risks so far.

## Safer Use
- 2C-I seems very setting-dependent and is only suitable for parties to a limited extent.
- Be aware of set and setting: Use 2C-I only in places where you feel comfortable and safe. Do not use if you are afraid of the drug.
- Never consume 2C-I alone and only when you feel mentally and physically well and are well rested.
- Do not add more, dose carefully.
- Drink enough water during the trip.
- Follow the safer-sniffing rules when sniffing.
- People with cardiovascular diseases and diabetics are at increased risk when consuming 2C-I.

2C-I is a psychedelic phenethylamine and a member of the 2C family ( [2C-B](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-b/) , [2C-E](http://thedrugclassroom.com/video/2c-e/) , 2C-P, etc). It is less popular than 2C-B. Its derivative, 2C-I-NBOMe (25i-NBOMe) has been more widely used.

The drug was sold by some shops in the early 2000s. Since then, it has been a niche drug and has seen little use.

We don’t know what a lethal amount of the drug may be. As such, it’s wise to use a dose in the “common” range and avoid combinations or frequent use.

  "wikipedia": `# 2C-I
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2C-I*

2C-I, also known as 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and 2C families. It is taken orally.
2C-I was first synthesized and described by Alexander Shulgin in 1977 and was described in further detail in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug is used recreationally. 2C-I is sometimes confused with other related psychedelic drugs such as 25I-NBOMe (NBOMe-2C-I), nicknamed "Smiles" and "N-bomb" in the media.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), 2C-I has a dose range of 14 to 22 mg orally and a duration of 6 to 10 hours. Its onset is within 40 minutes and peak effects occur after about 2 hours. In addition to oral administration, 2C-I may also be insufflated. The effects of 2C-I have been reported to include color enhancement, psychedelic visuals, emotional enhancement, limited insights, increased energy, enhanced conversation and honesty, improved mood, and sensual immersion. The sensual effects of 2C-I were described as different from and possibly less than those of 2C-B.

## Interactions

2C-I is metabolized by the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine, tranylcypromine, moclobemide, and selegiline may potentiate the effects of 2C-I. This may result in overdose and serious toxicity.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

2C-I acts as a serotonin receptor agonist. It produces psychedelic effects via serotonin 5-HT2A receptor activation.
It is inactive as a monoamine releasing agent and shows negligible activity as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor.
2C-I is a highly potent anti-inflammatory drug similarly to various other serotonergic psychedelics. However, 2C-I showed the highest anti-inflammatory potency of any other assessed drug in a large series in one study. It was more potent than (R)-DOI in terms of anti-inflammatory activity.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 2C-I has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of 2C-I include 2C-H (2,5-DMPEA), 2C-B, 2C-C, DOI, and 25I-NBOMe, among others.

## History

2C-I was first described in the scientific literature by Alexander Shulgin and colleagues in 1977. Its properties and effects in humans were described by Shulgin in 1978. The drug was subsequently described in greater detail by Shulgin in his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved). In the early 2000s, 2C-I was sold in Dutch smart shops as a recreational drug after the related drug 2C-B was banned.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Australia

2C-I is a schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (October 2015). A schedule 9 drug is outlined in the Poisons Act 1964 as "Substances which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of the CEO".

#### Canada

As of October 31, 2016, 2C-I is a controlled substance (Schedule III) in Canada.

#### European Union

In December 2003, the European Council issued a binding order compelling all European Union member states to ban 2C-I within three months.

#### Finland

Illegal: scheduled in the "government decree on substances, preparations and plants considered to be narcotic drugs".

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdag added 2C-I to schedule I ("substances, plant materials and fungi which normally do not have medical use") as a narcotic on March 16, 2004, published by the Medical Products Agency in their regulation LVFS 2004:3.

#### United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, 2C-I is controlled as a Class A substance.

#### United States

As of July 9, 2012, in the United States 2C-I is a Schedule I substance under the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012, making possession, distribution and manufacture illegal. A previous bill, introduced in March 2011, that would have done the same passed the House of Representatives, but was not passed by the Senate.
