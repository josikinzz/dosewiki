4-Hydroxy-DIPT Dose
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
4-Hydroxy-DIPT (or 4-HO-DIPT) is a tryptamine very similar to the more common 4-Acetoxy-DIPT. It is found as a slightly off-white powder and is usually taken orally. Dosages of 4-Hydroxy-DIPT are slightly lower than for 4-Acetoxy-DIPT.

4-HO-DiPT and [4-Acetoxy-DiPT](https://erowid.org/../4_acetoxy_dipt/4_acetoxy_dipt_chemistry.shtml) are closely related chemicals. It is possible that 4-Acetoxy-DiPT is metabolized into 4-HO-DiPT in the body in much the same way that Psilocybin is metabolized into Psilocin before it reaches the brain. They will both have very similar effects when taken orally, though dosage will be slightly different.

## SYNTHESIS
To a stirred suspension of 0.25 g LAH in 10 mL anhydrous THF, stirred, under nitrogen and at room temperature, there was added a solution of 0.33 g 4-acetoxyindol-3-yl-N,N-diisopropylglyoxylamide in 10 mL anhydrous THF. This was added dropwise at a rate that maintained the reaction at reflux. When the addition was complete, the reflux was maintained for an additional 15 min and then the reaction was cooled to 40 Â°C. The excess hydride and the product complex were destroyed by the addition of 0.5 mL EtOAc followed by 1.5 mL H2O. The solids were removed by filtration, the filter cake washed with THF, the filtrate and washings pooled, and the solvents removed under vacuum. The residue was distilled at the KugelRohr and the distillate dissolved in 1 mL MeOH. One equivalent of dilute HCl was added, and the volatiles were removed under vacuum. The solid residue was recrystallized from MeOH/Et2O to give 0.13 g (47%) of 4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine hydrochloride (4-HO-DIPT) with a mp 263 Â°C with decomposition. Anal: C,H,N.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 15 mg, orally) âThere was an alerting, noisy and nice, in 30 minutes. I swear I am already there. Nice friendly place. Perhaps some light tension, like a chill, maybe my body temperature response is confused. At the two hour point I am substantially out of the experience. Short, intense experience, basically enjoyable. Another hour and I am back to where I started in every way.â

(with 20 mg, orally) âIt has a bitter taste. Early signs noted at 15â20 minutes which include mild sensation of central stimulation, âlooseningâ of muscles in arms, legs, and neck. Mild distortion of objects and slight color effects, typically ârainbow halosâ around objects. Plateau reached in 20 minutes. Mild elation with relatively simple intellectual musings about the nature of the compound and how one could describe the nature of the state of mind and body caused by this material. 2.0 hours, mild effects. 2.5 hours, nearly normal. Mild but entirely pleasant experience with rather abrupt termination of effects. Could be a good candidate for psychotherapy sessions, certainly good for ânoviceâ introduction to hallucinogens.â

(with 20 mg, orally) âFifteen minutes, it starts and develops fastâvery niceâsome leg tremor. Thirty minutes, I am already well over a plus 2. Speed of onset is incredibleâI could not driveâI feel robbed of voluntary action. Forty minutes, this could not get any deeper. Fifty minutes, incredible orgasm. Fifty five minutes, I struggle to put a name to it, just +++ smashedâwith eyes closed very littleâI am somewhat chilledâno visual, no sensory, this seems like an extreme Aleph-7 Beth state (see Places in the Mind, chapter 10) beth state as it was described in PiHKAL. One hour ten minutes, Rubenesque fancyâno sex but back-to-mother cuddly imageryâremoved from physical angles. One hour thirty minutes, go for two very significant pieces of wood for the fireplaceâif all my actions are preprogrammed and I am following commands, then I have no free willâif the command is âto have free willâ, then I obey. Whom? Who? Why obey an undefined, unheard commander? Still +++. Nothing is inventive, all is preprogrammed. One hour forty minutes, back to ++, still very much in the grips of âlack of self determination.â I could function rationally in the lab, but following âwhoseâ directions? Is this finally God? Is this a religious experience? One hour fifty minutes, down to +, This has to have been a religious awakening. Two hours, still a little zombie-like, but largely down. Two hours twenty minutes, I am still shaken to my roots by these realizations. Three hours, completely together.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Speed: The effects are noted with a quarter hour following ingestion. LSD is one of the few psychedelic drugs that can show its early effects in the first few minutes. This suggests fundal absorption.

Intensity: The second 20 milligram report sounds as if there was some flirting with the magical plus-four transcendental peak experience. I happened to be the subject, and I was impressed.

Brevity: To be on a trip and then to be back pretty much in two hours and really baseline in another hour? Most unusual. If there will ever be an acceptance of drugs such as these, in a psychotherapeutic context, a short duration is of extreme value to both the patient and the therapist.

Sensitivity to dose: There have been a number of trials at and below the 10 milligram bottom, and most have been substantially without activity. And yet, there have been no trials at higher than 20 milligrams, as far as I know. That is a lot of steepness in the dose-response curve.

And similar comments can be made regarding the consistency of physical side-effects. There seemed to be a muscular tremor, and a vague body malaise, that is part of the trip. At least when the psyche got going, the body going got less noticeable.

An interesting sideline. This is the same nitrogen substitution pattern, N,N-diisopropyl, that is present in the rather dramatic sex-enhancer 5-MeO-DIPT. I wonder what might come out of an exploration of this substitution pattern in the world of the phenethylamines? As a rule, most phenethylamines lose their appeal with substitution on the nitrogen atom. But has anyone tried to make an N,N-diisopropyl homologue of MDMA, for example? Or of mescaline? Or of DOM? It would be interesting to explore these areas.

**4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine** (also known as **4-HO-DiPT** and **Iprocin** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class that produces [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) -like [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) . It is the 4-hydroxy analog of [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) and is structurally related to tryptamines like [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) ( **Psilocin** ), [4-HO-MiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-MiPT) ( **Miprocin** ), and [4-HO-DET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DET) ( **Ethocin** ).

Following the publication of its synthesis by David B. Repke in 1977, its effects in humans were investigated by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) . It is characterized in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ( *"Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"* ) and is noted for being unique among psychedelics in terms of its speed (apparent 15 minutes after ingestion), intensity (20 milligrams can produce a transcendent peak experience), brevity (2-3 hours), and dose sensitivity. Additionally, idiosyncratic physical effects like muscle tremors and bodily malaise were noted.

Today, 4-HO-DiPT is used for both recreational and [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) purposes. It is relatively uncommon and occasionally distributed on the online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) market. Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity in humans, and it has a limited history of human use. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DiPT, or 4-Hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the tryptamine chemical class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 4-HO-DiPT is substituted at R4 of its indole heterocycle with a hydroxyl functional group OH−. It also contains two isopropyl groups bound to the terminal amine RN of its tryptamine backbone.

4-HO-DiPT is a 4-hydroxy analog of [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) and the N-substituted isopropyl homolog of [4-HO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-HO-DMT) .

## Pharmacology

Like most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, 4-HO-DiPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from 4-HO-DiPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors. However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: 4-HO-DiPT](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_4HODiPT.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational 4-HO-DiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because 4-HO-DiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried 4-HO-DiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

4-HO-DiPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 4-HO-DiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 4-HO-DiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 4-HO-DiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 4-HO-DiPT. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of 4-HO-DiPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : 4-HO-DiPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person, placing it on the market and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not punishable. The legislator considers it possible that orders of 4-HO-DiPT are punishable as an incitement to place it on the market.
- **Sweden** : 4-HO-DiPT is classified as a "health hazard" under the act "Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor" (translated to the "Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health") as of March 1, 2005 in their regulation SFS 2005:26, making it illegal to sell or possess.
- **Switzerland** : 4-HO-DiPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : 4-HO-DiPT is a Class A drug in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : 4-HO-DiPT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) ( *4-HO-DMT* ), a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or industrial intents and purposes could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 
- **Florida** : 4-HO-DiPT is a Schedule I controlled substance in the state of Florida, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess.

  "wikipedia": `# 4-HO-DiPT
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-HO-DiPT*

4-HO-DiPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine or as iprocin, is a psychedelic drug of the tryptamine and 4-hydroxytryptamine families related to psilocin (4-HO-DMT). It is taken orally. The drug has an unusually fast onset, short duration, and narrow dose range.
It acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Unlike many other psychedelic tryptamines, the drug appears to have far lower potency as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor relative to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It is a derivative of DiPT, a higher homologue of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and 4-HO-DET, and a skeletal isomer of 4-HO-DPT. 
4-HO-DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by 1977. It was later described in greater detail by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug by 2005. In the 2020s, a prodrug of 4-HO-DiPT known as luvesilocin (RE-104, FT-104; 4-GO-DiPT) was developed and is in clinical trials for the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as postpartum depression.

## Use and effects

In his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved) and other publications, Alexander Shulgin reported that 4-HO-DiPT had a dose range of 15 to 20 mg orally and a duration of 2 to 3 hours. However, a wider dose range of 3 to 30 mg or more orally has also been reported. Shulgin has stated that 4-HO-DiPT has an especially steep dose–response curve and narrow dose range, with doses below 10 mg producing few to no effects and doses of more than 20 mg having not been tested due to the intensity of its effects. He personally found that a 20 mg dose produced an intense plus-three experience on the Shulgin Rating Scale that "flirted with" the magical plus-four transcendental peak experience. The drug's onset of action is 15 to 20 minutes and peak effects occur after 20 to 30 minutes. Shulgin has stated that he "truly doubt[s] that there is another psychedelic drug, anywhere, that can match [4-HO-DiPT] for speed, for intensity, for brevity, and [sensitivity] to dose, at least one that is active orally."
The effects of 4-HO-DiPT have been reported to include introspective changes, insights and realizations, mild object distortion, slight color effects, rainbow halos around objects, very little in the way of closed-eye visuals, little in terms of psychedelic visuals or sensory changes in general, mild stimulation, mild elation, light tension, orgasmic enhancement, and powerful religious-esque experiences. Other effects included sensations of muscle loosening, leg tremors, chill-like sensations, and vague body malaise. Shulgin has stated that he doubts that 4-HO-DiPT could be distinguished from psilocin (4-HO-DMT) in any blinded clinical study. Due to its rapid onset and short duration among other qualities, 4-HO-DiPT has been described as a "good 'novice' introduction to hallucinogens".

The effects of 4-HO-DiPT have been clinically studied in the form of its prodrug luvesilocin (RE-104; FT-104; 4-GO-DiPT). Luvesilocin was evaluated at doses of 5 to 40 mg (equivalent to ~4–32 mg 4-HO-DiPT) by subcutaneous injection in this study. It was specifically assessed in terms of modified Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ) ratings, Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) ratings, and adverse effects.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

4-HO-DiPT acts as an agonist of serotonin receptors, including the serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. It may also act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, although its potency is variable across studies. The drug appears to activate the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor with low potency and much lower than for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. However, in another study, it was only about 2.5-fold more potent as an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor relative to the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. The drug activates other serotonin receptors with lower potency as well. Unlike many other tryptamines, 4-HO-DiPT is not a ligand of the rodent trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1).
The drug has been found to produce the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. In addition, it has fully efficacious anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical research. 4-HO-DiPT has also been found to produce anxiolytic effects in rodents.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of 4-HO-DiPT have been studied. The elimination half-life of 4-HO-DiPT in humans when given in the form of its prodrug luvesilocin (4-GO-DiPT) by subcutaneous injection has been found to range from 2.7 to 4.1 hours. The average experience duration was 3.6 hours at a dose of 30 mg in the study.

## Chemistry

4-HO-DiPT, also known as 4-hydroxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, is a substituted tryptamine. It is a synthetic analogue of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and of the naturally occurring serotonergic psychedelics psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and psilocybin (4-PO-DMT).

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of 4-HO-DiPT has been described.

### Analogues

4-HO-DiPT is closely related to analogues including diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT), 5-MeO-DiPT, psilocin (4-HO-DMT), 4-HO-DET (ethocin), 4-HO-MET (metocin), 4-HO-MiPT (miprocin), 4-HO-DPT (deprocin), 4-HO-MPT (meprocin), 4-HO-DALT (dalocin), 4-HO-MALT (malocin), and 5-HO-DiPT, among others. 4-AcO-DiPT (ipracetin), 4-PrO-DiPT, and luvesilocin (4-GO-DiPT) are ester prodrugs of 4-HO-DiPT.

## History

4-HO-DiPT was first described in the scientific literature by David Repke and colleagues in 1977. Subsequently, its effects in humans were described by Alexander Shulgin in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2005. Luvesilocin (4-GO-DiPT), a prodrug of 4-HO-DiPT, was first described in 2021.

## Society and culture

#### Finland

Scheduled in government decree on psychoactive substances banned from the consumer market.

#### Germany

Scheduled in New Psychoactive Substances Act (NpSG). Use of covered substances is permitted only for industrial and scientific purposes.

#### Sweden

Sveriges riksdags health ministry Statens folkhälsoinstitut classified 4-HO-DiPT as "health hazard" under the act Lagen om förbud mot vissa hälsofarliga varor (translated Act on the Prohibition of Certain Goods Dangerous to Health) as of Mar 1, 2005, in their regulation SFS 2005:26 listed as 4-hydroxi-N,N-diisopropyltryptamin (4-HO-DIPT), making it illegal to sell or possess.

#### United States

4-HO-DiPT is not scheduled at the federal level in the United States, but it is possible that it could be considered an analog of 5-MeO-DiPT, in which case purchase, sale, or possession could be prosecuted under the Federal Analog Act. The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed scheduling 4-HO-DiPT in January 2022, but due to an effective public response, it withdrew its proposal in July 2022.

##### Florida
