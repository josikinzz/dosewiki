# Escitalopram
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB01175*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylbutylamines. These are compounds containing a phenylbutylamine moiety, which consists of a phenyl group substituted at the fourth carbon by an butan-1-amine.

### Background

Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-enantiomer of racemic
citalopram
.
11
It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety.
18
,
19
,
20
Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-enantiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-enantiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive enantiomer.
6
,
14
Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class.
13
Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.
16
,
13
,
15

### Indication

Escitalopram is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults and pediatric patients 12 years old and older and for the acute treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in adults and pediatric patients 7 years old and older.
18
,
18
It is additionally indicated for symptomatic relief of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in Canada.
19

### Pharmacodynamics

Escitalopram belongs to a class of medications called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These agents cause an increase in serotonin levels in neuronal synapses by preventing the re-uptake of serotonin (5-HT) into the presynaptic terminals of serotonergic neurons.
11
,
6
,
18
,
19
As compared to other SSRIs, it appears to have a relatively quick onset of effect due to its potency.
14
,
15
SSRIs as a class have been associated with abnormal bleeding, particularly in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other medications affecting hemostasis, and with the development of serotonin syndrome. Use escitalopram with caution in patients with a higher-than-baseline risk of bleeding and in patients receiving concomitant therapy with other serotonergic drugs. Escitalopram may also cause a discontinuation syndrome with abrupt removal of the drug, and should be slowly tapered if discontinuation of therapy is warranted.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter
Binder

### Absorption

Absorption of escitalopram following oral administration is expected to be almost complete, with an estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 80%. T
max
occurs after about 4-5 hours.
18
,
19
,
20
C
max
and AUC appear to follow dose proportionality - at steady state, patients receiving 10mg of escitalopram daily had a C
max
of 21 ng/mL and a 24h AUC of approximately 360 ng*h/mL, while patients receiving 30mg daily had a roughly 3-fold increase in both C
max
and 24h AUC, comparatively.
6

### Metabolism

The metabolism of escitalopram is mainly hepatic, mediated primarily by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 and, to a lesser extent, CYP2D6. Oxidative N-demethylation by the CYP enzyme system results in S-desmethylcitalopram (S-DCT) and S-didesmethylcitalopram (S-DDCT) - these metabolites do not contribute to the pharmacologic activity of escitalopram, and exist in the plasma in small quantities relative to the parent compound (28-31% and <5%, respectively).
18
,
19
,
20
There is also some evidence that escitalopram is metabolized to a propionic acid metabolite by monoamine oxidase A and B in the brain, and that these enzymes constitute the major route of escitalopram metabolism in the brain.

### Half-life

The elimination half-life of escitalopram is 27-32 hours, though this is increased by approximately 50% in the elderly and doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function.
11
,
18
,
19
,
20
The elimination half-life of escitalopram's primary metabolite, S-desmethylcitalopram, is approximately 54 hours at steady state.

### Toxicity

Symptoms of overdose may include CNS effects (dizziness, convulsions, coma, somnolence), gastrointestinal distress (nausea, vomiting), and/or cardiac abnormalities (hypotension, tachycardia, ECG changes).
18
,
19
,
20
There is no specific antidote for escitalopram overdose. Management of overdose should focus on monitoring for cardiac abnormalities and changes to vital signs as well as treatment with supportive measures as indicated. As escitalopram is highly distributed into tissue following oral administration, forced diuresis, dialysis, and other methods of extracting drug from plasma are unlikely to be beneficial.

### Drug Interactions

### Mechanism of action

Escitalopram, like other selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, enhances serotonergic activity by binding to the orthosteric (i.e. primary) binding site on the serotonin transporter (SERT), the same site to which endogenous 5-HT binds, and thus prevents the re-uptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron.
11
,
6
,
13
Escitalopram, along with
paroxetine
, is also considered an allosteric serotonin re-uptake inhibitor - it binds to a secondary allosteric site on the SERT molecule to more strongly inhibit 5-HT re-uptake. Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs.
16
,
13
The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT
1A
auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.
17
,
13
Escitalopram has shown little-to-no binding affinity at a number of other receptors, such as histamine and muscarinic receptors, and minor activity at these off-targets may explain some of its adverse effects.

### Protein binding

Escitalopram exhibits relatively low protein binding at approximately 55-56%.
18
,
19
,
20
,
6

### Route of elimination

After oral administration of escitalopram, approximately 8% of the total dose is eliminated in the urine as unchanged escitalopram and 10% is eliminated in the urine as S-desmethylcitalopram.
18
,
19
,
20
The apparent hepatic clearance of escitalopram amounts to approximately 90% of the total dose.
19

### Clearance

The oral plasma clearance of escitalopram is 600 mL/min, of which approximately 7% is due to renal clearance.

### General Function

Translocates drugs and phospholipids across the membrane (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:8898203, PubMed:9038218, PubMed:35507548). Catalyzes the flop of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic to the exoplasmic leaflet of the apical membrane. Participates mainly to the flop of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, beta-D-glucosylceramides and sphingomyelins (PubMed:8898203). Energy-dependent efflux pump responsible for decreased drug accumulation in multidrug-resistant cells (PubMed:2897240, PubMed:35970996, PubMed:9038218)

### Specific Function

ABC-type xenobiotic transporter activity

### Gene Name

ABCB1

### Uniprot ID

P08183

### Uniprot Name

ATP-dependent translocase ABCB1

### Molecular Weight

141477.255 Da
