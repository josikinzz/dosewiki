## Subjective Experience

Whilst MDA was first synthesized in 1910, and was subsequently tested and used for
various medicinal purposes, it didn’t emerge as a recreational drug until the 1960's.
Its effects are often compared to those of MDMA, although there appears to be a
number of significant differences, not least its apparent variability, a greater
stimulation and a stronger psychedelic edge.

It is currently a Schedule 1 controlled drug in the US and a Class A drug in the UK.

Regarding dose, MDA is often cited as requiring about half as much as MDMA to
approximate the same level of effect. Listed in PiHKAL (#100), Shulgin referred to a
dosage of 80-160mg, whilst across Internet forums a decent dose is sometimes
claimed to be 1mg per kg (about 75mg for the average man). This is broadly what I
will be pitching at.

Note that at time of testing I have become particularly cautious with drugs in this
class due to hangovers following a couple of recent experiments. Internet references
to neurotoxicity, with some citing MDA specifically, have further tempered my
enthusiasm for a more substantial foray.

```
T+0:00 I measure 80mg and bomb it in folded rizla paper. [4.00pm]
```
```
T+0:30 A mild headiness is developing along with a slight tingling of the skin,
which is enveloped within an increasing general comfort. This is coming on
quickly.
```
```
My pupils are already partly dilated.
```
```
T+0:40 I am now high. There is a very strong cognitively immersed euphoric
feel to this, and a strong empathogenic drive. Horn is also clearly available.
```
```
I am heating up quickly, so I am keeping well topped up with water, even at
this early stage.
```
```
I already know that 80mg was a plentiful dose and wonder with a little
trepidation how much further this will go.
```
```
T+1:10 This is a heady, sweaty, serene-like experience, with a sex drive and a
trippy edge. I am probably in the upper ++ Shulgin range at the moment,
hovering towards +++.
```
```
I can just about interact sensibly, but would fail with any complex or serious
social challenge, at least in terms of hiding my condition.
```
```
It is a pleasant enough roll, but with a little anxiety surfacing now and again
on the basis that it could go higher and beyond my ability to manage it.
```
```
T+1:20 For the first time I feel that I may be getting on top of this: possibly.
```
```
I am rather hot and clammy, my mind is high with a strong drifty aura, and I
feel very empathetic. There is a touch of psychedelia lurking there too, which
impacts upon clarity.
```
```
T+1:40 I am now in more control of the experience, which remains strong.
Whilst the general warmth is a heavy physical feature, there are occasional
shivers. I know in these cold snaps that it would be a mistake to add clothing
as my temperature is clearly elevated.
```
```
The empathetic quality of the high is still a dominant factor, with a strong urge
for intimacy. It is glaringly obvious why its sister, MDMA, is sometimes
referred to as the love drug. I should stress though that in most respects MDA
does seem to be more cognitively embracing than MDMA.
```

```
I am in the middle of ++ territory, as it ebbs and flows.
```
```
T+2:00 Although I am still in command of my mindset, I am warmer than
ever: I am actually sweating. I don’t feel uncomfortable with this, with the
buzzing high carrying me along. However, I can absolutely understand how
people become dehydrated, and indeed over-hydrated, as measuring the
appropriate intake of fluid is not a trivial task. I sip sensibly rather than
gulping heavily.
```
```
T+2:45 I am very much rolling, and perhaps still in the midst of a ++. The
headspace remains in situ as a nice rounded high, and I am still hot and still
drinking fluid. Drinking alcohol with this would clearly be reckless and
dangerous.
```
```
I do feel jaw tension and the urge to gurn, but I am able to resist.
```
```
T+3:10 I manage to eat a full meal without too much difficulty. It was very
slow going but there were no issues, and taste was fine.
```
```
T+4:00 I have moved down a gear or so, but I am still drifting along.
```
```
T+6:00 I am now floating down towards base. However, a sudden unexpected
visit from a neighbour demonstrates that I am still, in fact, quite heavily
influenced.
```
```
During the next few hours I edge towards normality but still sustain a drifting
headspace as I retire to bed at midnight (T+ 8 hours).
```
The night’s sleep wasn’t too bad, with only a couple of disturbances, largely caused by
the volume of water I drank.

In the morning my head was slightly heavy, and I was still a little warm. My pupils
were also partly dilated, particularly the left. Presumably this all indicates that the
MDA hangs around in the system for quite a while. The accompanying tiredness and
mental fatigue eased during the day.

Perhaps also noteworthy is that a couple of nights later I had an extremely vivid
dream, the nature of which indicated that this intake of MDA may have been related,
particularly with respect to the stimulation of those receptors associated with
hallucinogenic effects.

Make no mistake about it, this was a strong roll. 80mg came on fast and whisked me
away with a head and body high that took me to the edge. Had I taken what is
purported to be a strong dose I have little doubt that I would have careered off the
path.

Caution should be exercised both with dose and frequency of use.
