## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as dialkylamines. These are organic compounds containing a dialkylamine group, characterized by two alkyl groups bonded to the amino nitrogen.

### Background

Propylhexedrine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist often used in nasal decongestant inhalers. It is used to give temporary relief for nasal congestion from colds, allergic rhinitis, or allergies.

### Indication

It is used to provide temporary symptomatic relief of nasal congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis.

### Pharmacodynamics

Like other monoamine releasing stimulants propylhexedrine is active as a norepinephrine and dopamine releaser in the central nervous system. The acute effects of the drug closely resemble the physiological and psychological effects of an epinephrine-provoked fight-or-flight response, including increased heart rate and blood pressure, vasoconstriction (constriction of the arterial walls), bronchodilation, and hyperglycemia (increased blood sugar).

### Mechanism of Action

Synaptic vesicular amine transporter
Antagonist

### Toxicity

The signs and symptoms that are produced after the acute overdosage of Propylhexidrine include Psychosis, Burning sensation.

### Mechanism of action

Propylhexidrine causes the norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin (5HT) transporters to reverse their direction of flow. This inversion leads to a release of these transmitters from the vesicles to the cytoplasm and from the cytoplasm to the synapse. It also antagonizes the action of VMAT2, causing the release of more neurotransmitters.

### General Function

Intracellular G-protein coupled receptor for trace amines, which recognizes endogenous amine-containing metabolites such as beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), 3-iodothyronamine (T1AM), isoamylamine (IAA), cadaverine (CAD), cyclohexylamine (CHA), p-tyramine (p-TYR), trimethylamine (TMA), octopamine and tryptamine (PubMed:11459929, PubMed:11723224, PubMed:15718104, PubMed:31399635, PubMed:36100653, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118). Also functions as a receptor for various drugs and psychoactive substances, such as amphetamine and methamphetamine (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377). Unresponsive to classical biogenic amines, such as epinephrine and histamine and only partially activated by dopamine and serotonin (PubMed:11459929, PubMed:11723224). Expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous system: TAAR1 activation regulates the activity of several neurotransmitter signaling pathways by (1) decreasing the basal firing rates of the neurons involved and by (2) lowering the sensitivity of receptors to neurotransmitters (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37935377, PubMed:37963465, PubMed:38168118). Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of downstream effectors (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). TAAR1 is coupled with different G(i)/G(o)-, G(s)- or G(q)/G(11) classes of G alpha proteins depending on the ligand (PubMed:31399635, PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). CAD-binding is coupled to G(i)/G(o) G alpha proteins and mediates inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). T1AM- or beta-PEA-binding is coupled to G(s) G alpha proteins and mediates activation of adenylate cyclase activity (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). CHA- or IAA-binding is coupled to G(q)/G(11) G alpha proteins and activates phospholipase C-beta, releasing diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) second messengers (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). TMA-binding is coupled with all three G(i)/G(o)-, G(s)- or G(q)/G(11) G alpha protein subtypes (PubMed:37935376, PubMed:37963465). Amphetamine-binding is coupled with G(s)- or G(12)/G(13) G alpha protein subtypes (PubMed:31399635)

Legal Status
 
by Erowid
 
U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Paroxetine**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Over-The-Counter
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Propylhexedrine (Benzedrex) is unscheduled in the United States and is approved for over-the-counter sale. Propylhexedrine is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription. Sales for human consumption are regulated by the FDA and each formulation or product requires specific FDA approval. 
 
 It appears that Propylhexedrine was placed in Schedule V in the United States in May 4, 1988 (53 FR 10869) and then removed from Schedule V on Dec 3, 1991 (56 FR 61372). Unfortunately, we do not have access to the federal register entry to determine why it was unscheduled. [ [DEA Ref](http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/actions/chronlogical.htm#2000) ]
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Canada #
 
Propylhexedrine is Schedule V in Canada.

**Propylhexedrine** (also known as **Benzedrex** and **Obesin** ) is a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cycloalkylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cycloalkylamine) class. It is a structural analog of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . Propylhexedrine is widely used medicinally as a nasal decongestant (for relief of congestion due to colds, allergies and allergic rhinitis) and sometimes used recreationally as an over-the-counter "legal high".

Benzedrex was first manufactured by Smith, Kline and French after the Benzedrine inhaler, which contained racemic amphetamine, became unavailable following the placement of [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) on the US Schedule II status (i.e. highest abuse potential, yet with accepted medicinal uses). Propylhexedrine has also been used in Europe as an appetite suppressant under the trade name Obesin. In the United States, propylhexedrine is most commonly found in over-the-counter Benzedrex nasal inhalers.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Anecdotal reports describe propylhexedrine's effects as similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or low-dose [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) . However, it is reported to produce more peripheral effects like [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) as well as less euphoria, overall resulting in a less "clean" high. In the United States, propylhexedrine is sometimes extracted from over-the-counter Benzedrex nasal inhalers using lemon juice. The health risks of this practice have not been studied.

Due to its amphetamine-like euphoric effects, propylhexedrine is considered to have moderate abuse potential. Chronic use may result in tolerance, physical and psychological dependence. It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Propylhexedrine is chemically classified as a [cycloalkylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cycloalkylamine) . It is structurally similar to [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine_(compound)) and [its derivates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) . It is particularly similar in structure to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , with the only structural difference being the substitution of an cyclohexane ring for methamphetamine's phenyl ring. This makes propylhexedrine a structural analog of methamphetamine.

Moreover, propylhexedrine is a chiral compound (the α-carbon is chiral), and the product contained in pharmaceutical products is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is believed to be the more biologically active isomer of the two, although [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamines) with a "levo" prefix are less active than their counterparts. (S)-Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from methamphetamine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

[Freebase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_base) propylhexedrine is nonpolar, volatile, oily liquid at room temperature, but it readily forms a polar salt when protonated with hydrochloric acid, citric acid, and acetic acid to form a crystalline white substance. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] As a volatile liquid, it evaporates over time, losing potency drastically quicker than crystalline substances; However, the salt forms are crystalline, and do not evaporate.

## Pharmacology

Propylhexedrine affects the central nervous system (CNS) by acting as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) ( [SNDRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine_releasing_agent) ), binding to and reversing their transporters, pumping these neurotransmitters from the cytosol to the synaptic cleft, where these neurotransmitters can bind to their respective receptors. Additionally, propylhexedrine inhibits [VMAT2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_monoamine_transporter_2) , leading to a further increase in the aforementioned monoamines, being that VMAT2 transports all 3 from the synaptic cleft to the cytosol. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Propylhexedrine, like [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) , [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , agonizes [TAAR1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAAR1) . TAAR1 agonism, through protein kinase A & C (PKA and PKC) signaling, causes dopamine transporter (DAT) phosphorylation. Both PKA and PKC result in non-competitive dopamine reuptake inhibition, although PKC alone results in dopamine release/DAT reversal.

The pharmacological actions of propylhexedrine are similar to those of [phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamines) , such as [amphetamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) , albeit in a generally less centrally active and recreationally desirable fashion.

Since propylhexedrine has a cyclohexane ring in the place of methamphetamine's phenyl ring, it lacks the level of Brain-Blood Barrier permeability that the phenyl ring provides amphetamines, and therefore has a greater proportion of effects on the peripheral nervous system relative to the central nervous system.

Propylhexedrine has a half-life of 2.5 - 6.5 hours, which is variable based on urinary pH and the level of activity of certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes. Higher urinary pH elongates duration, while low urinary pH shortens duration. Higher activity of certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes also shortens duration.

Propylhexedrine is metabolized by certain Cytochrome P450 enzymes into norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, *cis* -4-hydroxypropylhexedrine and *trans* -4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, propylhexedrine is usually considered to be extremely energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is extremely similar to that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , and stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) . It is similar to the stimulation experienced on racemic or the levorotorary form of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or the racemic [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , encouraging physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which propylhexedrine presents can be described as forced or pressing and is noticeably more [adrenergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) and tense on the body. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of motor control.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Heart palpitations are commonly reported on common to heavy doses of this substance due to its significant peripheral nervous system activity.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Propylhexedrine has been noted by users to raise blood pressure significantly more than other stimulants. It has been speculated that this is due to its higher affinity for [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) relative to stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Due to its pronounced peripheral nervous system activity, propylhexedrine tends to increase heart rate much more drastically than comparable dosages of other stimulants.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - This effect is prominent on the onset and come up period when ingested via the cotton found inside Benzedrex inhalers, particularly when it is taken on an empty stomach.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - Propylhexedrine has been noted by users as being particularly vasoconstrictive in comparison to other stimulants. It has been speculated that this is due to its higher affinity for [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) relative to stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) . ### Visual effects
 
- As with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , the visual effects of propylhexedrine are usually less consistent and are only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to the visual effects produced by [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and are generally more frequent in darker areas. 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - An uncommon effect that only occurs at very high, potentially dangerous or toxic dosages.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** - This effect is usually subtle and barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Commonly this consists of level 1-2 drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of propylhexedrine can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of propylhexedrine is described by many as one of moderate to extreme mental stimulation, increased focus, and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or extended usage. This particularly holds true during the offset of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria)** - The euphoria capable of being produced by propylhexedrine is reported to be similiar to that of [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) at high doses.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)** - Due to depletion of the essential neurotransmitters [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephine](/w/index.php?title=Norepinephine&action=edit&redlink=1) , propylhexedrine can cause moderate to strong feelings of depression after large doses.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - According to anecdotal reports, residual feelings of wakefulness can persist for up to 12 hours after the initial high wears off.
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Pharms - Propylhexedrine](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Propylhexedrine.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity of recreational propylhexedrine use has not been studied as extensively as that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) but it is reasonable to assume that most if not all of the same risks apply.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of propylhexedrine can be considered highly addictive, and is capable of causing psychological and physiological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops or drastically decreases their usage.

Tolerance to the effects of this compound likely occurs in the same general fashion as with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Propylhexedrine presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of propylhexedrine all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) will have a reduced effect.

Like with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine the evidence on effective treatments for dependence and abuse is limited. In light of this, [fluoxetine](/w/index.php?title=Fluoxetine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [imipramine](/w/index.php?title=Imipramine&action=edit&redlink=1) appear to have some limited benefits in treating abuse and addiction

In highly dependent [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abusers, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue methamphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams. Withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence (i.e., the extent of abuse). The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) withdrawal. . It is likely that propylhexedrine abuse is subject to these same outcomes.

### Psychosis

Like with the abuse of methamphetamine, propylhexedrine abuse can result in a stimulant-induced psychotic state that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ), though likely to a lesser degree. A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Tricyclic antidepressants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant)** - Propylhexedrine may increase the effects of tricyclic antidepressants to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Propylhexedrine should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.).

  "wikipedia": `# Propylhexedrine
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propylhexedrine*

Propylhexedrine, sold under the brand name Benzedrex among others, is an alkylamine primarily utilized as a topical decongestant. Its main indications are relief of congestion due to colds, allergies, and allergic rhinitis. Propylhexedrine was first used medically in 1949, with the release of Benzedrex by Smith, Kline & French, and it has been used, mainly within the United States, since then.

## Medical use

Propylhexedrine is used to treat acute nasal congestion related to the common cold, allergies, and hay fever. For nasal congestion, the dosage is listed as four inhalations (two inhalations per nostril) every two hours for adults and children 6–12 years of age. Each inhalation delivers 0.4 to 0.5 mg (400 to 500 μg) in 800 mL of air. Use is not to exceed three days.
Historically, it has also been used for weight loss in oral tablet preparations at a dose of 25 mg. No medications containing propylhexedrine are currently approved for weight loss in any country since roughly 1976.

## Contraindications

Propylhexedrine should not be used if a MAOI has been used in the past 14 days or is currently in use by a person.
Unlike other topical decongestants, propylhexedrine is not required to carry a warning against use in individuals with hypertension.
Propylhexedrine is not recommended in individuals younger than six years of age. There is at least one case of reported accidental poisoning resulting from child access to a propylhexedrine product.

## Adverse effects

When used as an inhaler, the most common adverse effects warned about for propylhexedrine are temporary discomfort (e.g., stinging or burning sensations) or rebound congestion. The sharing of propylhexedrine inhalers may spread infection. The occurrence of these adverse effects is uncommon as propylhexedrine is generally recognized as safe and effective. However, the use of propylhexedrine products in manners not intended by their labeling can result in severe adverse effects not typically encountered in therapeutic settings. The outcomes of improperly using propylhexedrine products can include hospitalization, disability, or even death. Public health agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have advised propylhexedrine products only be used in the manners directed on their label.

## Overdose

Reports of overdoses from propylhexedrine have been documented, but they are uncommon. Most instances of overdoses attributed to propylhexedrine have been the result of improper use of a propylhexedrine product in a manner not intended by its labeling for (non-medical) recreational purposes. As noted by the FDA, the most common symptoms of propylhexedrine overdose are the following: "[r]apid heart rate, agitation, high blood pressure, chest pain, tremor, hallucinations, delusions, confusion, nausea, and vomiting." The use of propylhexedrine products in manners inconsistent with their labeling has proven fatal in some cases. Propylhexedrine products are considered to be safe and effective if used as intended. Regardless, medical attention should be sought in the case of suspected overdose.

## Interactions

Most of propylhexedrine's interactions with other medications have to do with its ability to constrict blood vessels. Propylhexedrine's most serious interaction is with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), which are contraindicated. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are used, albeit uncommonly, as an antidepressant. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised when administering propylhexedrine concurrently with other medicines.

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of action

Propylhexedrine works mainly as an adrenergic agonist, when used at therapeutic doses in an inhaler dosage form. This restricts the blood vessels in the nose and reduces swelling; thereby, it relieves nasal congestion. At higher doses, propylhexedrine affects the central nervous system as a norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (NDRA). Propylhexedrine likely exerts such effects in a manner similar to related alkylamines such as cyclopentamine, methylhexanamine, and tuaminoheptane. Propylhexedrine also exhibits antihypotensive effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

Propylhexedrine undergoes metabolism via N-demethylation, C-oxidation, N-oxidation, dehydrogenation, and hydrolysis to form various metabolites such as norpropylhexedrine, cyclohexylacetoxime, cyclohexylacetone, and 4-hydroxypropylhexedrine.

## Chemistry

Freebase propylhexedrine is a volatile, oily liquid at room temperature. The slow evaporation of freebase propylhexedrine allows it to be administered via inhalation. The evaporation of the freebase also accounts for the limited shelf-life of propylhexedrine inhalers. Many of the salts of propylhexedrine are stable, clear to off-white crystalline substances that readily dissolve in water.
Propylhexedrine is similar in chemical structure to phenylethylamines. Phenylethylamines and substituted phenethylamines are found in the core of many trace amines and sympathomimetic drugs. The main difference is the presence of an alicyclic cyclohexyl group instead of the aromatic phenyl group of a phenethylamine.

Propylhexedrine is a chiral compound. The active ingredient contained in Benzedrex inhalers is racemic (RS)-propylhexedrine as the free base. (S)-Propylhexedrine, also known as levopropylhexedrine, is the more biologically active isomer of the two. The dextrorotatory counterpart, which is mainly unused, is dextropropylhexedrine.

### Synthesis

Propylhexedrine can be synthesized from cyclohexylacetone through the reductive amination of an intermediary imine over an aluminum-mercury amalgam in the presence of a hydrogen source.

However, propylhexedrine is more commonly prepared by the catalytic hydrogenation of methamphetamine over Adams' catalyst. This transforms methamphetamine's phenyl ring to a cyclohexyl moiety.

The selective synthesis of enantiopure levopropylhexedrine can be accomplished through the initial Wenker synthesis of an intermediate aziridine followed by catalytic hydrogenation.

### Detection in bodily fluids

Administration of propylhexedrine can lead to false positives for phenethylamine derivatives on urinalysis panels. Propylhexedrine can be differentiated upon further analysis.

## History

Propylhexedrine's medical use as a decongestant evolved from desires to find safer alternatives to previous agents. After searching for such an agent, Dr. Glenn E. Ullyot patented propylhexedrine as a decongestant in 1948. This patent was issued for benefit of Smith, Kline & French. Before it was sold nationally in the United States, propylhexedrine underwent market trials in California. These market trials began on July 15, 1949. Propylhexedrine (under the brand name Benzedrex) was first introduced into commerce on August 4, 1949. 

Approval for use in the United Kingdom soon followed in 1956. Later, approval for use in Canada was granted in 1998. In 2023, B. F. Ascher & Co. decreased the amount of propylhexedrine in the Benzedrex inhaler from its historic 250 milligrams down to 175 milligrams.
Barbexaclone, an anticonvulsant containing propylhexedrine, was used in Turkey until its withdrawal from the market in 2009. Barbexaclone's former niche in Turkish medicine is now largely occupied by levetiracetam.

## Manufacturing

The manufacture of propylhexedrine products for therapeutic use is typically performed based on guidelines established in government regulations and pharmacopeia monographs.
The illicit manufacture or diversion of propylhexedrine by clandestine chemists for use as a recreational drug has been documented in academic literature. Similar to when opioids are manufactured clandestinely for recreational use, it is unlikely that propylhexedrine produced by clandestine chemists adheres to the standards for purity, identity, and strength required of therapeutic products.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### International control

Propylhexedrine was placed under international control by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances in 1985. This action was reversed in 1991.

#### Australia

Propylhexedrine is an S4 substance in Australia.

#### Brazil

Propylhexedrine is a Class B1 substance in Brazil.

#### Canada

Propylhexedrine was long reported to be a Schedule V substance in Canada. In 2022, this status changed and propylhexedrine has since been removed from control under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

#### Germany

Propylhexedrine is regulated as a prescription medicine in Germany. Initially, propylhexedrine products were available over-the-counter. However, this changed in the 1970s and propylhexedrine is now regulated as a prescription product in Germany.

#### United Kingdom

Propylhexedrine was formerly a Class C substance in the United Kingdom, but was deregulated in 1995. Propylhexedrine was used recreationally during a brief period in the 1970s after increased government regulation on earlier decongestants.

#### United States

On the 4th of April 1988, propylhexedrine was designated a controlled substance (Schedule V) in the United States. This was done to satisfy U.S. compliance with an international treaty. However, in 1991, this action was reversed and propylhexedrine was removed from control under the Controlled Substances Act. This was based on the opinion of the Drug Enforcement Administration that propylhexedrine did not warrant control. The substance has remained unregulated under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States ever since. Furthermore, pursuant to DEA regulations, certain Benzedrex inhalers are specifically exempt from the Controlled Substances Act. Propylhexedrine remains regulated under the laws of several U.S. states. These states include the states of Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, and Rhode Island.

### Recreational use

Multiple public health agencies (most notably within the United States) have warned against the recreational use of propylhexedrine and advised for its use only as directed by a product's labeling; nonetheless it has been reported, through the literature as early as 1959, that propylhexedrine products have been used for recreational purposes. Recreational use is potentially fatal, its risks are magnified when administering the substance through injection means, and the adverse effects of recreational propylhexedrine are more severe when compared to related substances. The undesirable side effects of propylhexedrine at recreational doses are less tolerable compared to other substances that produce similar effects; consequently, propylhexedrine is less desirable for recreational use. The fact that propylhexedrine is less potent than comparable substances has also limited recreational use. Even in areas with prevalent substance use, the use of propylhexedrine was reported as non-significant; nonetheless, the recreational use of nasal decongestant, anorectic, and anticonvulsant preparations of propylhexedrine has been reported. The recreational use of propylhexedrine products has been on the rise since the early 2000s.
In 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the following warning in regard to recreational use of propylhexedrine products in manners inconsistent with their labeling:

...[T]he abuse and misuse of the over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant propylhexedrine can lead to serious harm such as heart and mental health problems. Some of these complications, which include fast or abnormal heart rhythm, high blood pressure, and paranoia, can lead to hospitalization, disability, or death....Propylhexedrine is safe and effective when used as directed.
That same year, the Indian Health Service issued the following statement in reference to the recreational use of propylhexedrine products:

Only use propylhexedrine according to the instructions on the package label. Do not use it in ways other than inhalation. Seek medical attention immediately [...] by calling [emergency services] or Poison Control [...] for anyone using propylhexedrine who experiences [any of the following:] [s]evere anxiety or agitation, confusion, hallucinations, or paranoia[,] [r]apid heartbeat or abnormal heart rhythm[,] [or] [c]hest pain or tightness[.]
A year later, in 2022, the U.S. Army published the following guidance on propylhexedrine. The guidance states that recreational use of propylhexedrine is not permissible by service-members, can open its participants up to disciplinary action, and carries potentially fatal risks:

When disciplining a member for suspected use of any drug, it is important to consult [legal counsel] on how to proceed, [according to the Office of Drug Demand Reduction] [...] This is especially important when the evidence supporting discipline consists of scientific reports and data that may require special assistance in their interpretation. In cases involving [propylhexedrine], legal consultation is highly recommended.
Put briefly, the FDA, Indian Health Service, and U.S. Army all advise individuals not to use propylhexedrine products for recreational purposes.

### Economics

Propylhexedrine, under the brand name Benzedrex, is sold online by retailers such as Amazon, eBay, and Walmart. Propylhexedrine has been sold in some countries as an anorectic or as part of an anticonvulsant preparation; however, such products are not sold freely to consumers and require a physician's prescription.

### Brand names

#### Benzedrex inhaler

Propylhexedrine, as a nasal decongestant, is currently marketed under the brand name Benzedrex. The name was initially trademarked by Smith, Kline & French in 1944. The brand was passed onto Menley James Laboratories (through a subsidiary, NuMark Laboratories) in 1990, and was finally acquired by B. F. Ascher & Co. in 1998.

#### Dristan inhaler

Propylhexedrine was also sold in inhaler form by Whitehall Laboratories (Wyeth) under the Dristan brand name as an inhaler.
