What does Syrian Rue do for u?  I remember it being suggested to intensify mushrooms.  However, isnt 5meoDMT enough on its own?  i mean, it truly is a force to be reckoned with, especially the first time.  It is orgasmic bliss. It was my absolute favorite psychedelic by far until i became an opiate addict and didnt want to disrespect the cousin of the spirit molecule.

Syrian Rue is an MAOI. I want to make a pharmahuasca with 5-meo-DMT instead of DMT. Not sure if that's a wise idea or a potential trip disaster.

DwayneHoover had what sounded like an absolutely glowing experience with Syrian Rue and 5-MeO-DMT. He wrote it up on page 25 of the first B&D, post 614

I used to be a big advocate of this one, and used to find it my holy grail, while DMT was simple fun with no redeeming properties as a entheogen (when smoked) but now I find DMT to be my go-to (fumurate salt IMed at 50-100mg).  I did try this one again over the summer after an 8 year recess and was unable to get a ++++.  Times change, outlook changes, brain grows up, taste change, etc.

i saw a video where Alexander Shulgin said something along the lines of " endogenous levels of DMT and 5-MEO-DMT in everyday life " it made me think about bass music !


i haven't tried 5-MEO-DMT i seem to have opted for DPT as the first big one for me...... but i dont know when i'll muster the balls to take it

I was also wondering about the MAOI + 5-MeO-DMT combination. I was thinking of B. Caapi 30 minutes before taking a dose of 5-MeO-DMT orally. The tricky think to get right would be the dosage. I suspect it would be a case of titration. There's not much out there regarding personal experiences.

^ thank you for the advice ! i already have a strange preconception of what it will be like - me sitting on a spiral staircase and the staircase spirals downwards whilst i stay still on it, so the staircase is revolving downwards like a corkscrew but i stay still without going with it, just a kind of floating

**5-MeO-DMT Hcl vs. Freebase**


I have the opportunity to obtain 5-MeO-DMT from a reliable online vendor.  When I inquired about the prices of their product, they replied with a price listing for 5-MeO-DMT Hcl or 5-MeO-DMT Freebase.  I am more interested in the effects of vaporizing the chemical in a similar fashion to N,N-DMT than I am in insufflating the drug or taking it with an MAOI.  This being said, I was hoping to find out any pertinent differences between the two different types.

You need freebase for vaporization. Salts have higher boiling points so do not vaporize as easily.


Freebase compounds are caustic on mucous membranes, which is why salts are used for sublingual or insufflation. For oral use, a freebase can be encapsulated or dissolved in an acidic drink. A salt will usually dissolve easily in plain water.

yesterday i tried smoking 5meodmt for the first time(i have only snorted it until now). I used the hcl form and i think it worked just fine. First i tried ~10mg in some am2201 home made blend. smoked like this it came on gradually almost like smoking. Then i vaped ~5mg 5meodmt + ~15mg dpt in a lightbulb and that was quite intense it came on almost immediately with super intense body load and nausea that ruined a otherwise great state of mind. Smoking/vaping psychedelics just isn't for me my body feels too shocked too fast, snorting (atleast for me) is the perfect roa maybe a little more material is needed but the effects are just as intense but come on a bit slower(without needing to wait 30mins) last longer and shits like bodyload and nausea are much more managable

snorting 5-meo-dmt freebase works nicely.  Just snort extremely small bumps over the course of 10 minutes and the burn really isn't that bad at all, although it is there.

How much of the freebase would one snort? Is it less potent than smoking it? Dosages?


Has anyone tried sublingual with the freebase? How does that work? Dosages?

For a person who will be trying this without a sitter, is there a potential for the body to get up and wander around like we've seen in the Salvia YouTube videos?  Is an improvised seat belt a good idea?

I never had a full on breakthrough with this one but I really didn't like the feeling or taste.  I much prefer DMT.

It's slower, but I wouldn't call it that much softer. Vaporized, you're "in" before you know it, while with insufflation that process is slower, which makes that you can experience the shift in consciousness more consciously. Which, in turn, can be unnerving.

5-MeO-DMT is the most brutal and intense psychedelic I've ever tried and I doubt there's a more powerful compound (for me, subjectively of course) out there. I had smoked 5-MeO-DMT 50+ times and insufflated it some 20-30 times before smoking N,N-DMT. DMT actually felt benign in comparison. The brutal onslaught of 5-MeO-DMT is just so more powerful, the bodyload is more intense, the word "extreme" doesn't even give an adequate description of 5-MeO-DMT. I have a love-hate relationship with it. Sub-breakthrough experiences can be absolutely terrifying, I just get incapacitated, my heart is racing and I feel like I'm going to die. With breakthrough experiences it's very different because "I" is smashed into pieces in 15 seconds and I only feel absolute bliss, freedom, a strong feeling of profoundness. No other compound completely obliterates my ego, there's always a remnant of my ego left with other compounds. The afterglow is one of the best of all psychedelics, very euphoric, and lasts considerably longer than the afterglow of DMT. 5-MeO-DMT is more physical, the first time I smoked DMT I was surprised how benign it felt, yes it hit me hard and fast but not mercilessly.


I do like DMT more than 5-MeO-DMT, considerably more, but 5-MeO-DMT still has a special place in my heart. However nowadays I smoke it very rarely, and really have to consider if I want to take it. Big doses are my way of taking it, as I want to be sure there's a breakthrough.

There's no risk for respitary depression, as 5-MeO-DMT raises your heart rate very much, it's very stimulating. Benzo's could probably help, but the onset is so powerful you would have to take a huge dose of benzo's which would dampen the experience (too) much. I've never done it with 5-MeO-DMT but I've once smoked DMT on a beta blocker (I didn't take it because of the DMT, but the beta blocker was still very active) and it took away very much of the psychedelia. This I've also notice with 4-subs, I just get such a high blood pressure on some 4-subs I feel like I have to take a beta blocker and it really takes away very much of the "trippyness".


Edit: You are breathing, both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT can induce a feeling, especially on the onset, that you're not breathing. Also on 5-MeO-DMT people quite often forget to breath out after inhaling the smoke as the 5-MeO-DMT has already hit you. Of course they breath out eventually but the onset kind of makes some people to forget to exhale the smoke, keeping it in the lungs for quite some time.

12 milligrams was smoked.  A rushing sensation was felt starting at the base of my spine and going up the center of my body.  This powerful feeling was the major feature of this experience as there really wasn't anything to see.  At about 90 seconds I started hearing a powerful sound that was not coming from the ears.  It was like tinnitus only a lower note maybe an octive below middle A.  This was not a breakthrough dose so I never lost ego-control.  I could see around the room everything was moving on the surface but there were no closed eye visuals other than the swirling purple clouds going down the drain which is what I've always seen with my eyes closed.  Feelings and emotions were powerful but impossible to describe.  The Sound receded about 4 or 5 minutes in.  I had not been able to decide if this is enjoyable or not - are we having fun yet?  But at about this point I decided I liked what was happening.  I began to feel very positive.  Thoughts were rushing through my mind.  I have an important financial decision I need to make and the answer just popped out, as though the drug told me the answer.  I thought about Spring and Summer and how much I like those seasons and all the things I like to do.  


At about 19 minutes I felt I was close to baseline enough to get up but the legs were rubbery and the mind woozy and I was a little nauseous.  The slight dizziness and nausea lasted a few hours.  In the 24 hours since the experience I've felt a marked increase in the positiveness of my general outlook.  I've battled depression for years and I know all about judging my mood and outlook and I've definitely experienced a anti-depressive effect from the experience.  


That's the easy part to explain.  The feeling going up my body at the time felt like the universe itself flowing through me.  I read some James Oroc in preparation and he claims he was atheist until trying 5-MEO-DMT.  I have been telling people I'm atheist in recent years but, in truth, I think I'm really agnostic, I just like to provoke and argue with Christians.  That powerful feeling flowing through me, what the hell was it?  I can see that a person who does believe in God could interpret it as blessings from the lord flowing through him or her.  But I don't believe in that right?  


I think I'm going to stop calling myself an atheist and go back to agnostic, because I just don't know.  I think 12 milligrams of 5-MEO-DMT just flipped the God bit in me at least partially.

Have you ever tried it orally before? If not, I'd not jump into the deep end, but slowly build your dose from a couple of mgs. Adverse reactions have occured when combining it with MAOi's: [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_health.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_health.shtml). Anyway, please let us know how it went! I'm planning on combining it with MAOi's in the upcoming months, but I think I'll start with =< 3 mg + 30 gr caapi to be sure.

So I did a large dose for my first time.

23 mg, smoked.


It's so insanely intense, not like anything I've every tried. So chocked by the intensity and I feelt like puking because of it a couple of times.

I was somewhere between dying, dead and having a epilepsy attack while time ceased to exist. I was somehow able to keep the trip between ok and mild panic.

I want to say that reason I didn't panic was because of my psychedelic experince but to be fair it could just as well gone to hell.


But I'm very intrigued by it and I want to do a larger dose ( but this time prepared for it ) but I don't want to black out. 

Have this happend to people and in that case at what doses?

Because even after this time it's hard to remeber the trip and if you would remeber less if you take bigger dose it woulsd be such a waste ( have very little to work with )


Note:

I don't have epilepsy it's just based on what I've seen on TV \o/.

Got hold of a lil' bit of this one and wanted to ask for a good ROA (besides smoking) and starting dose? Since oral (without an MAOI) seems pretty mild, i thought of trying it intranasal. Any suggestions? 


Btw, are there any known fatals when combining 5-MeO-DMT with Syrian Rue in proper doses? Is it dangerous if used correctly?


Thanks a lot!

For me personally smoking was the preferred ROA. But be careful with dosage, 5-MeO-DMT is a potent substance in any manner.


Concerning your question on combining Harmala and 5-MeO-DMT ([from Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/5meo_dmt/5meo_dmt_health.shtml)):


> Contraindication : 5-MeO-DMT and MAOIs Although 5-MeO-DMT is present in some plants used in ayahuasca and in some ayahuasca brews, Erowid has received several reports of very troubling physical reactions in people who have ingested 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI harmala alkaloids. There appears to be the risk of severe hypertensive symptoms, overheating, serotonin syndrome, etc. It is important to note that the profile of these risks are not fully understood, because the long history of use of brews containing some amount the two in combination.

^ Thanks a lot for your reply. Perhaps i'm really thinking about smoking this one...but i normally don't smoke and thinking about smoking some powder really puts me off. Any dosage suggestions for both perhaps, smoking and intranasal?


Is there that much difference between those two ROAs?

it is general consensus that 5-MeO-DMT is not active orally; but then, there is also the claim of Jonathan Ott that this is in fact wrong, see [http://www.erowid.org/general/conferences/conference_ayahuasca1.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/general/conferences/conference_ayahuasca1.shtml) . there is the statement


> He tested the 5MeO oral activity and found it "quite dramatically orally active"

I just discussed this in a german forum and decided I could not live with the uncertainty any longer, so I gelcapped 10 mg 5-MeO-DMT freebase and swallowed it. that was about half an hour ago, and to my own surprise, I am feeling an uncertain threshold effect (+/- on the Shulgin scale) now...


anyone else tried this compound orally? I guess I'll just have to repeat this experiment with higher dosage some day to get certainty...

Just tested it via insufflation @ 10mgs and it was nice, nothing spectacular but nice enough to do it again.

15 mg of 5-MeO-DMT HCL produced effects, but those were weaker than approx. 5 mg insufflated, so it was quite light. Nevertheless, something was definitely present.

I can't see the point in large doses of this. I tried 15mg, and it was perfect. As in, I felt perfect for the duration. It was like dying, in a very good way.


As I've said before in the social thread, I tried 25mg and was making whale noises into the floor for half an hour xD. Thing is, I can't remember it. And none of my friends can remember their experiences on what must have been 'breakthroughs'. This confuses me. My experience on 25mg must have been intense... but it was pointless. Last thing I remember was my vision, of the pipe, just shattering, and then the next thing I'm aware of is being sat on the floor in a different room.


Anybody else experience these blackouts?

I think I might finally sample some of my 5-meo-dmt for the first time tomorrow. I got some fresh oil burners so I wont have to  worry about any resin from other chems contaminating my trip.  What is the best way to inhale it. Should I hold the flame under the bubble until I see vapor swirling around the inside and gently breath in. Thinking about starting with maybe 8-10mg. Would that be ok for a first timer that is very experienced with other psychedelics? Is this drug good with music or is silence better? I was thinking of playing some instrumental stuff like explosions in the sky.

I always listen to that kind of music while tripping, i love that band i'm sure it will be ok, also something like Mogwai, Amiina, Deerhoof, God is an Astronaut, Giardini di mirò and Sigur Rós should fit well.


Last time i snorted 5-Meo-DMT i was listening to The Fiery Furnaces (Bitter Tea) and Mr.Gnome (Madness in Miniature) but these are more psychedelic and experimental rock, anyway my favourite ones while tripping, they make the experience even more spectacular enhancing the OEVs.

Tbh i need good music with any substance while tripping, expecially if i'm alone.


That day i used 20 mg of the fumarate and it was really intense trip but not a good one for me, i don't like this sort of chemicals, too fast and aggressive onset, within few minutes i was really high and confused, i was a pretty bad experience like i had on salvia, start low imo.

I experienced an insane blackout on a combination of substances, including AMT, a-PVP, a small amount of DMT smoked and 15mg of 5-MeO-DMT. I was launched into a spaceless void. In the beginning the nothingness was very uncomfortable, but then a sensation of overwhelming euphoria grew on me, and then I blacked out completely. I awoke later surrounded by my friends and parents, they said that I had been thrashing around uncontrollably, shouting "I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU", and that they had to sit on me in order to stop me from hurting myself.

Not to judge, but some of the folks who posted here sound a little nutty with their dosages.  10mg is the max I've ever taken, and is the max I have ever given anyone who wished to have the experience.  On a personal level, I consider myself pretty darn experienced with psychedelics since I've been tripping for more than half my life...when it comes to 5-MeO-DMT; 10mg caused a full amnesia experience with nothing of any value to bring back.  7mg is the perfect dosage, gives me the full shebang and I can remember it too (that is key).  I am confident in these dosages because I have shared it with a number of people and 7-10mg is always plenty no matter who I share it with.  For the most part, it really doesn't matter if you listen to music or not, a white-out trip to the milky is what happens and you don't bring your ego with you to hear any music...at least that is how it works for me....suppose music is nice when you come back to your body.  Now DMT...different story, I will get a little nutty and don't think twice about smoking 100mg, but of course that is a whole different animal.

Just had my first experience with this compound. Approx 7mg smoked. Immediately a Sense of heaviness came over me like someone throwing a lead blanket over me. This was accompanied by a deep fear that manifested itself in nausea. I found myself retching into the garbage can but didnt vomit. I asked for some music to be played (the room with me and two friends had been silent) and tried to relax. A sense of relaxation then swept over my body and gave me sensations all over my skin. I felt very lethargic and sedated as I reclined on the couch. It wore off after a few minutes, leaving behind a gentle and wholesome afterglow. As of right now I cant decide whether or not I like it. The thought of higher doses both intrigues and frightens me, as I know theres more there to be had. Not sure if I can handle it though

I thought you said heavenliness for a second, which is what I got from 5-MeO-DMT sans the fear, body load or vomiting. But I insufflated it (sometimes with ketamine) and did not go extremely high...


My sterile vials arrived this week, so as soon as I get some filters and syringes I will be preparing a solution by making the citrate, to use for I.M.

Hopefully it will be very efficient that way and relatively gentle, at least less messy than snorting or smoking considering I don't mind injecting anymore since my K days.


I wonder how it combines with MXE, there could be problems since 5-MeO-DMT can be a strong drug physically (apparently much more dangerous with MAOIs than N,N-DMT for example) and MXE does not play well with everything.

i find mixing 5meodmt with some mxe much more smoother & with no anxiety. iv combined them in high and low doses and haven't had any negative interactions. 3meopcp works good too. i have yet to try with ketamine that will be the best combo surely

MXE seems to play poorly with most serotonergic agents, possibly including direct agonists (per a couple alarming anecdotes).  I know that 5-meo-dmt blocks monoamine transport to some extent.  Anyone know whether SERT is involved (stupid journal article pay-walls!)?

I would like to read your procedure for making 5-meo-dmt citrate...i have always wanted a vial of 5-meo-dmt.   I have a friend that blacks out on higher doses.  I do not have this problem,  when I eat mushrooms I usally smoke 5-meo-dmt during or after the peek and usally remeber everythang remarkably whell.  I usally dont weigh doses I regulate by the number of hits I take...but i love 5-meo-dmt and I am an exeption so please dont do this unless you have alot of experince with it.

Well, I'm close to done gathering equipment (fresh IM needles, wheel micron filter...) and the plan is this:


10 mg I.M. would be waaay to much but I still might make a 10 mg/ml concentration, simply for the convenience of the number. Perhaps 5 mg/ml if I decide that otherwise the usual volumes will be annoyingly small, but I'd rather not ever have to inject twice with a 1 ml syringe if I go over 5 mg. 

So let's say 10 mg/ml. My vials can contain 20 ml, but let's say I want to make 10 ml because I'd rather not waste 200 mg if it turns out that it degrades quickly in solution. 10 ml x 10 mg/ml = 100 mg 5-MeO-DMT.


I will just use crystal citric acid to salt the stuff and dissolve it in physiological concentration saline. Recently I did the calculation and stoichiometrically it would take virtually as much weight of citric acid as weight of 5-MeO-DMT freebase for a 1:1 molar ratio (it would be a slight excess of acid, which I will almost certainly need).


So I take 100 mg citric acid and dissolve it in perhaps 2 ml of saline if I can. I want to use as little as possible because a high concentration should mean a faster salting reaction and it seems better to top off with the rest of the saline later.

When the acid is dissolved I start adding the 5-MeO-DMT.

The tricky part is that I might need a bigger excess of acid to properly salt all the 5-MeO-DMT but I won't just keep adding it because the more acidic it will be the more it will probably sting. But what's tricky is that if the 5-MeO-DMT stops dissolving I cannot be sure if I need more saline or more acid. 

I guess I will then try adding another part of the saline, and try to see if there is any change of the amount of 5-MeO-DMT that will probably float on top. If little or no change I will add a modest amount of extra citric acid and observe what happens. Hopefully it will show me what is needed.


I continue until all 5-MeO-DMT is dissolved, add saline until it is at the full 10 ml and run it through a 0.2 µm filter into the sterile vial.


If I can get my hands on it I might add a little benzyl alcohol to preserve it, but for the time being this is it. I will store it in the fridge and check for precipitation regularly.


On another note I am considering reconstituting noopept in acetic acid, but that is just an idea unlike the vials of 5-MeO-DMT, MXE and a few other things that I will be preparing soon.

No problem! Only I made a bit of a mistake: citric acid is a triprotic acid, which means that the molecules have 3 (acidic) carboxyl groups each.

If it were true that upon dissolution all of these groups would be able to protonate 5-MeO-DMT then it would be just as simple as using 3 times as much 5-MeO-DMT (moles / molecules) as citric acid. Which would be 3 times the weight since like I said the molecules have masses that are almost equal.


However this is not true, citric acid is a weak acid and the rate at which these groups deprotonate is complex and can be thought of to happen in 3 steps.

Not sure if I will be able to use the 3 dissociation constants to figure out when there are enough protons to salt the 5-MeO-DMT, and adding the 5-MeO-DMT will further complicate these equilibria.


I think it's best to just try this experimentally instead, by starting off with only half of the amount of citric acid I said earlier and adding more if it proves to be necessary. If this is done carefully there should not be so much of an excess that it would sting the living shit out of your muscles.

[Pharmacokinetic interactions between MAO-A inhibitor harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT and the impact of CYP2D6 Status.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23393220)


> 5-MeO-DMT is a newer designer drug belonging to a group of naturally occurring indolealkylamines. Our recent study has demonstrated that coadministration of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor harmaline (5 mg/kg) increases systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 mg/kg) and active metabolite bufotenine. 
> 
> 
> 
> This study is aimed at delineating harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions at multiple dose levels, as well as the impact of (CYP2D6) that affects harmaline PK and determines 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce bufotenine. Our data revealed that inhibition of MAO-A-mediated metabolic elimination by harmaline (2, 5 and 15 mg/kg) led to a sharp increase in systemic and cerebral exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2 and 10 mg/kg) at all dose combinations. A more pronounced effect on 5-MeO-DMT PK was associated with greater exposure to harmaline in wild-type mice than CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mice. 
> 
> 
> 
> Harmaline (5 mg/kg) also increased blood and brain bufotenine concentrations that were generally higher in Tg-CYP2D6 mice. Surprisingly, greater harmaline dose (15 mg/kg) reduced bufotenine levels. The in vivo inhibitory effect of harmaline on CYP2D6-catalyzed bufotenine formation was confirmed by in vitro study using purified CYP2D6. Given these findings, a unified PK model including the inhibition of MAO-A- and CYP2D6-catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT metabolism by harmaline was developed to describe blood harmaline, 5-MeO-DMT and bufotenine PK profiles in both wild-type and Tg-CYP2D6 mouse models. This PK model may be further employed to predict harmaline and 5-MeO-DMT PK interactions at various doses, define the impact of CYP2D6 status, and drive harmaline-5-MeO-DMT pharmacodynamics.

I finally got around to trying your procedure solipsis...but on a very small scale.  I started with 5mg of citric acid in .5ml I then added 11mg of 5-meo-dmt to the solution which eventually went into solution with some sturring.  This was then filtered with a .2micron whel filter...i then passed anouther .2ml through the filter to flush what remained in the filter.  A friend came over why I was finishing so I did not get to enjoy the fruits of my labor yet...im hoping there is not to much acid...what do you thank??

Did you check if nothing was left behind, in the filter for example? Not that I am so very surprised that it seems to have worked but always good to confirm..


I think this is nice to hear, and if 5 mg citric acid for 11 mg 5-MeO-DMT worked maybe 4 mg citric acid can also work for 12 mg 5-MeO-DMT. Why put in more acid if it is not necessary right? Although I really doubt that a little acid would be an issue. If there is ever a situation where large amounts of acid cannot be avoided, maybe mixing in a local anaesthetic is an option... not really sure how bad it is for your muscle / how much worse than lactic acid from exercise.


Does anyone know if it is best to dissolve ascorbic acid in tryptamine solutions? Not that I have pure ascorbic acid and not sure if you can extract vitamin pills by running it through several stages of filtering to get any and all solid matter completely out --> coffee filter, then whatman filter, then micron filter (and allowing it to settle before the whatman step), or if I have to I got vacuum glass filters at my father's house.


Damn it might be pretty awesome to make DMT ascorbate! 2 birds with one stone?


Thanks for letting me know so that I can skip trying it on microscale and proceeding with maybe 50 or 100 mg first with 5-MeO-DMT then also synthetic DMT.


I also want to check color and smell to get a reference point for those, for both trypts.


And I will also dissolve MXE and 3-MeO-PCE, each their own nice little vial. I received my needles, I only need to pick up a couple wheel filters at the pharmacy, then I am all set to make these preparations.


Tomorrow evening I have training and after that I am visiting a friend, so I won't be trying any of these before saturday. On saturday I think I might give 5-MeO-DMT a "shot" to see what tiny doses do, then working my way up slowly to see the quality of effects with IM.


Then after those trials I am probably going to make it a nice evening with MXE

If i am understanding you correctly...everythang dissolved and there was nothing left in the filter...i passed the .2ml through it to flush out any liquid that may be left in the filter.

I have no idea why anyone would ever feel the need to combine 5-MeO-DMT with another psychoactive substance. For me, vaporizing or smoking about 11 or 12 mg has always been the most direct way to mind, earth and consciousness shattering intensity. I hold a deep love and respect for the substance. Always felt frightened before doing it and always felt amazed and thankful afterwards. Haven't done it in years and I fear that the stuff I have lying around may have degraded to the point of not even active anymore, but I wouldn't mind dabbling in some 5-MeO-adventures again when the time comes. Awesome stuff, with a very pronounced accent on AWE.

Well, if there is ever a 'need' to combine anything can be argued but I too have combined with 5-MeO-DMT with ketamine... not sure if that was to try and numb the nose a bit or dissociate from the stinging feeling, or because I was just very used to snorting ketamine at the time and it made sense to just continue my session when taking the 5-MeO-DMT, or if I had other motives... but it was quite complementary.


A reason why I feel there is benefit in combining these two drugs is that drugs like 5-MeO-DMT and DPT can really pack a punch and can be jarring in a way that can be physically felt. Drugs like ketamine are very physically dissociative (at least the S isomer) and help make it much more comfortable without really removing you from the experience.

Instead it adds to it because it helps create a mindspace consisting mostly of an illuminated void (5-MeO-DMT does this on its own), but it makes it extra swirly like it is all lava lamp plasma convection streams.


Drugs that amplify the positive effects of other drugs while reducing the negatives are remembered as very worthwhile synergy in my book. But it can be pretty mindblowing, taking a moment to be complete baffled - it is best to at least sit down or better yet lie down for  it.


Yes 5-MeO-DMT is extreme on its own so you may very well need to reduce your dose a bit as with most things that synergize.

Definitely, I know what you mean. I am preparing IM solutions of 5-MeO-DMT and DMT right now and the odors of them really remind me of the immense respect these substances deserve, the ritualistic peace it is best to start with (if you want to reap what you sow)...


Hopefully 5-MeO-DMT does not kick my ass too much if I want to do a 1 mg trial.

1.5mg was almost overwhelming....what is your normal smoked dose of 5-meo-dmt??  When I was mixing with k I could get about 5mg to dissolve in 1ml, but there was already 100mg of k disolved in the 1ml.  I felt like I could handle more 5-meo-dmt but could not get it to dissolve into solution.  I am thanking I will need to work my way up to disired dose again, I am wondering now if I wasnt geting it all disolved.  I was planning on doing all 11mg at once...but now im thanking on starting smaller and working up the proper way.  I am glad I read your post ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I never smoked it, only insufflation which was heavenly apart from the burn. I must also mention that I have used oral oxycodone IR today but I would be surprised if that had a negative impact.


You are not dissolving each and every separate shot are you? If you have solubility issues why not just start with the K injection and follow up with a 5-MeO-DMT injection using a 'stock' solution of both?


I chose 1.5 mg instead of 1 mg because I read about 2 mg being considered somewhat of a threshold for I.V. somewhere. Obviously my experiment is quite inconsistent with that.

I might very well have to dilute my solution 2x by adding another equal volume of saline.

Would it be safe to combine 5-MeO-DMT with aMT, as aMT is suspected to be an MAOi? I would like to experiment with a very small dose of the 5-MeO-DMT, just enough to pump up the experience, without the ego dissolving effects that a 7+mg vaporized dose would produce. 


Is the MAOI activity of aMT strong enough to potentially allow me to ingest the 5-MeO-DMT orally, as a sort of funky pharmauasca?

So far I have tried tried vaping and snorting 5meo-dmt I have vaped it about 5 times and snorted it around 5 times too. I started with vaping 2mgs then moved to 3mgs, 5mgs, 6mgs, and 8mgs. Even with 8mgs my effects were minimal. I just  got a small change in perception, euphoria, raised body temperature minor, OEVs( I know it isn't sapposed have any really) and CEVs. When I vaped 8mgs I hit my oil burner perfectly and held it in for a long time blowing out a big cloud; I don't know my the effects didn't even come close to all the reports I have read for equal  and lower doses. My nasal doses were about the same amounts and the effects for the most point were similar although  with  the lower doses like 2-3mgs I seemed to get slightly better effects nasaly most likely due to me messing up my vaping technique since it is sapposed to have a lower nasal ba.


I am thinking of vaping around 10 or 11mgs next time. I am also thinking about plugging it. Do you think around 2 or 3mgs would be a good place to start?

My vaped doses are usally over 10mg.  From my research it seams some need only a small dose while others can handle substantually more.  I find 5-meo-dmt to be one of those that the induvudal user needs to find his own dose.  Start low and keep working up....once your scared up it by a few more mg and thats a perfect dose....lol

Yeah, your reasoning makes sense, it's just that because of 5-MeO-DMT's sheer intensity, it's probably the last substance needy of combination ime. And that's probably also because I don't experience so many negative downsides. Physically I don't mind. The only thing that might be useful is something that provides with more time/space to take in the experience and to process it... but on the other hand that's also kinda the charm of the substance.

I thought it was the official term, but maybe consumption or user rooms are more commonly used. They're places for hard drug users to come and use their stuff in peace. In Dutch they're called *gebruiksruimte* and most major cities have at least a few. Nowadays they're mostly for people who smoke/vape crack cocaine or heroin - as injecting heroin has become a rather marginal activity among drug users in the Netherlands. At any rate, they oughta have some. 


> Started with ringing ears, I never had that from DMT or 5-MeO-DMT before, just with I.M. ketamine - might be pharmacokinetics related?

> Click to expand...


Not necessarily. I sometimes get that with both DMTs. Not always, but getting psychedelic body effects is not uncommon for me. Sometimes it may feel like a buzzing tone, sometimes as though your ears are closed. It can really feel like your body is also being transported into another dimension. Very odd. 


Anyway, keep reporting back as soon as you learned more. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tried my solution of 5-meo-dmt last night, first dose was 1mg  about 40min I did anouther 1.5  then a bit after that I did 2.5  I ended the night with eating a etzoliam and takeing a 5mg shot and getting into bed and tripping to sleep.


 But I do not have any muscle sorness today what so ever. I would be more sore from im'ing k then I got from im'ing 5-meo.  It did not sting or anythang when injecting.   


Was a nice night.


I wanted to update alittle.  last night i got 25mg of 5-meo-dmt to dissolve in .5ml of solution with 10mg of citric acid in the solution.  It took alittle more sturring and alittle heat but it all went...if 12mg of citric acid was used i bet the heat would have not been needed.


After that i went ahead and im'ed 7mg followed by 4mg 30min later.  lied in bed with some bineral beats on in meditative bliss

Solipsis, I am curious to know about your experiences snorting 5-MEO-DMT. I currently have a freebase. I snorted it once at about 5mg. The result was about as effective as eating 1/2g of mushrooms. I was extremely tired and was wanting to sleep when I snorted it. I laid and bed and listened to music. Nothing major happened. I was coming in and out of consciousness, not sure if it was very psychedelic. This is going back 6 months ago. The experience didn't have much worth remembering. 4 years ago, though, I smoked a solid hit of this chemical, and was brought way down into a breakthrough experience, unifying all things in the world, and aligning them within me, closing them within me. It was euphoric and nauseating. 


I'm still curious to snort 5-MEO-DMT. Its definitely a powerful, euphoric material. I snorted it when I was much younger and on a heavy dose of mushrooms. The room became blue, and I blacked out. But I also smoked it in the woods on mushrooms when I was much younger, and I remember feeling an ultra sense of clarity. 


Just curious to know some of the doses you used, what form the 5-MEO-DMT was in, what you experienced, and how your thoughts on using the chemical again in your future travels.


Thanks!

Is this completely inactive orally without maoi, and when you do take it orally with maoi you still require like 30mg?


Best way sounds like vaping, is it possible to smoke in a joint? Don't have access to pipe.

5-MeO-DMT has the best potential for helping to facilitate the ++++ (at least in my world, and the way I work with it) than any other psychedelic I have provided for others.  In fact, the way I use it...the way I introduce it....and the people that I will share it will (confirmed again last night) ALWAYS have a ++++ where they literally come out crying and thanking the universe for existence.  That effect happens EVERY Time.


Last night was the 14th first-time initiate I held a session for....a very wise seeking person who clearly was ready.  Never met him before, he was a friend through a friend.  We spent the evening preparing, learning about each other, me finding out his intentions and what he is seeking, and him asking me every question he could about the experience.


When I provide the sacrament I give a 'mantra' which is 'breathe' and I remind the initiate to focus on that mantra, that I sit across from the initiate watch them take it in, say out-loud "BREATHE' and then 'oneness' and then I breathe in rhythm with the hand-selected music (Fireman- "Rushes" song 4).  This initiate ran into a pickle about 30 seconds in which I was completely in-tune to....he began to hyperventilate so I took his hand, said 'breathe' loudly' and prayed and sent him good vibes, and he snapped out of the pickle, proceeded to call out "Thank you" and we both began to cry (he was still completely out of body but we both were aware) as he clearly had a ++++.  When the trip was over, I saw a man so grateful for life and so taken aback by meeting me and having a stranger want to selflessly facilitate a person to such an experience.


In his own words, he said I 'saved him' and pulled him back from the 'brink of darkness into the light.'  Then he called it the most life-changing experience he ever had...and **I reminded him that nothing in his life has changed...the 5-MeO-DMT only was a wake up call...I said he has to practice every day to change, to focus his intentions, and with practice he can get back to the 5-MeO-DMT state anytime he wants.

**

It was a huge growing experience for both of us....for me particularly to know I am able to recognize and 'pull back' an initiate from a dark space into the white light.  For all the bad things you read about 5-MeO-DMT...they just don't happen to anyone in my circle.  Approach it with the right intentions, be ready to surrender, accept the oneness.


He promised me a trip report so I will definitely publish it...such a good night for both of us.  I hope we remain life long friends.

Works fine in a pipe, hand-rolled cigarette, anyway.  NO idea why people say you have to vaporize it....I can confirm it smoked fine in any manor.

As a rule, the less you 'hotpocket' it, the less you need a hot burning joint (e.g. by taking exceedingly long puffs or aiding with a lighter).


edit: Oh really? did not expect that, the pharmacokinetics must matter a lot for the type of experience you will get, I am guessing. But it may be too confusing and debilitating to keep taking proper puffs for minutes on end.

I used it at about 10 mg insufflated, but I do think that it is considerably less potent this way. It was the freebase but that is probably not optimal for snorting because it does not dissolve well in water and is not absorbed fast in the nose. That was one reason why I liked it I guess: smoking or injection seem to cause a very rapid effect which makes it extremely intense. Then again that is the charm of it, if you can call it that. I do take this stuff seriously, maybe more than anything else.


Like MSG mentioned about his initiate, I tend to have hyperventilation type stuff and other physical panic symptoms as well. 1 mg intramuscular even felt like I couldn't physically handle it for a couple moments / minutes.

How I will use this chemical in the future depends on how far I am willing to go to find out if I need to go considerably higher to dissociate enough not to be preoccupied by such symptoms. And I am also a believer in intention and ritual just like I am with N.N-DMT. With other psychedelics there is enough time to "wing it", to have a rough idea of why I am tripping and working out the rest as I go along. DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are just too potent and brief for that and I get everyday thoughts spinning out of control in chaos if I don't focus first, preferably centering all down to the spiritual level if you understand what I mean by that.

I really need to try an IM shot of 5-MeO-DMT.  That is my go-to method for DMT and psilocin.  I was really BADLY turned off snorting 5-MeO-DMT (freebase)...mostly because of the ungodly pain...the trip itself wasn't so bad but the pain prevented me from feeling much of anything beyond, 'when the fuck will this stop.'


I VASTLY prefer DMT when IMed over smoking it....I have a feeling I could have a wonderful surprise in store for me when I get around to trying IMed 5-MeO-DMT.  Hmmmm.

Thanks for the reply solipsis. How deep have you gone in your trials with snuffing this material? Did 10mg give you a body buzz, euphoria, etc.? 


MGS, I enjoyed your post as much as the others did. You sound like a wonderful healer. How much 5-meo-dmt do you use in your trials? 


Lately I've been feeling like I need some sort of tryptamine. I've taken a break the past couple of months, because everything that is surrounding me right now seems to be a chaotic mess. I am definitely in need of a psychedelic experience. The last time I used this chemical, I hit a high +3. It was years ago. I recall, at first, being grounded, but then feeling ecstatic, rejoicing throwing my hands in the air reaching as far as I could reach. Laughing, smiling, I felt slight nauseous. It was scary when it started, but I felt brilliant afterwards. I think I may be looking for an experience like that. The experience was scary in the beginning because I felt as though I stopped breathing. I was able to ask my sitter if I was breathing, and he assured me I was. I was flipping out for a minute, I had him take me outside, and thats when it hit like I ton of bricks. I lay sprawled against the ground feeling an ecstatic merge with the world. I think when I got up, I had been rejuvenating by all of earths energy. I could now spring high into the air, waving my hands up in excitement. I probably smoked somewhere near 10-15mg.


Its up in the air though. Mostly I feel like I should eat mushrooms, or I've been debating working some sort of pharmahuasca. Ah, I don't know.


Goodbye

10mg is what my new friend took.  The dose I usually offer is 7mg-12mg.  In my work, 7mg or 8mg will give the full show but allow the user enough awareness of their body to 'not completely fade away' and some folks like that option...I usually prefer thr 7-8mg range myself....I can remember it all then and I get the most from it....I also am very sensitive to tryptamines.  At the 10mg-12mg range most everybody will completely surrender to the experience....total white out.  Anymore than 12mg, and it's amnesia land so I don't offer it any higher.


Re: needing a tryptamine


I find a small dose of psilocin and a hit of 5-MeO-DMT to be a divine combination.  Psilocin to get the positive vibes going and 5-MeO-DMT is the workhorse.  I am sure a smallish dose of mushrooms will work just as well.


What I tell people is 'embrace the fear.'  Pick your music (or silenece, whatever) out ahead of time, maybe even have a practice run.  Focus on breathing (this advice works every time)....and if you do eat some mushroom first it should have you in a positive mind set.  If you go this route, report back for sure!

Thanks for the quick response MGS. I've got one more question for you. Are you working with freebase material, or is it in some other form. 


Its amazing to think I didn't own a scale years ago, when I first got 5-meo-dmt. I remember a girlfriend loading a pipe for me in the woods, and boy did I feel wonderful when I took that first hit. Back then, I smoked it probably a dozen times. No scale, only did I get my scale a couple years later when a heavy wave of 2cs and other rcs was sweeping my area. I had about 100mg of the stuff. I used it twice with mushrooms, like I said previously. The first time was wonderful. I was tripping strong on mushrooms (3-4g), and I sauna'd myself before traveling into the woods to smoke it up. Wow what a sense of clartity. Now that I think of it there was 3 times I used it with mushrooms. So I had to experiences in the woods. The second time in the woods was after eating 2.5g of mushrooms. I don't believe I got a strong enough hit from the 5-meo-dmt. The actual trip wasn't big, but it seemed to make certain mushroom vibes stronger. Weird experience. A friend that I was with will never forget this day, because of something that happened in my mind that influenced him to see a clear vision of energy intertwined with communication. The third experience was a silly washout. I had eaten 4-5 grams of mushrooms. I was trying to smoke my friend up on it, but I was far too dissheveled. I ended up snorting 15mg or so, and smoking a hit. The last thing I remember is people leaving my room. I laid and bed, and 20minutes went by. I felt completely normal, with the exception that I have no memory of 20 minutes. Its like my mind shut off. 


Yah! back in the day I was a bit of an idiot with psychedelics... always pushing too far, seeing trips turn into distorted messes. Trying to find the breakthrough, it only took me years to realize that taking more didn't get you there. Although now it seems like I haven't gotten off in a while. I took a binge bender in november. But sense then, most of my experiences have been low dose. 2 months ago I ate a small dose of mescaline, and a month before that I ate 1 gram of mushrooms. Neither dose got me too intoxicated, and both were minorly psychedelic. I mostly did yoga and tried to listen to my body. 


If I do the 5-meo-dmt soon, I'll probably use 7mg. I'd much prefer to be a little more aware of my body. I was considering taking lower, perhaps 3-6mg, but I don't know if I can handle taking a low amount. IN january I ate some cactus tea (small dose). I puked nicely, but my trip wasn't major. 


Its weird because my mind has a hard time remembering what made me want to use psychedelics so much back in the day. While I was in those binging days all was good. I started losing meaning in some of the trips. I want my next trip to be significant, but I don't know if I can handle something super long lasting. 5-meo-dmt might be the thing for me. I'm just not super confident, it will give me what I'm looking for (something to heal my mind). I believe mushrooms have that power, and that if I do them I will feel good from them the next day. I'm sure they will make me feel more relaxed about the the things that are stressing me, and give me time to think of possible solutions to some of the problems I'm having. Will 5-meo-dmt have the power to take some of the trash out of my mind, or will it simply intoxicate me.


I'm sure I'll figure it out. Lately when I come home from yoga class is when I feel like smoking it, but I'm afraid it could mess up my yoga high, or distract me from something that is already good. And then when I'm feeling down, I just think taking another psychedelic will make me crazy. Lately I've been wanting to sweat it out with some bikram, then eat mushrooms the next day hoping to feel clean and pure and very aware of my body during the trip.

5-MeO-DMT won't do a damn thing but make you trip for 10 minutes.  Mushrooms won't do much more, but they last many hours.  Neither will heal your mind once the trip ends.  You still have to take out the trash, and you still have to do the hard work (ie make the changes you seek).


In my book, 5-MeO-DMT can be a great wake up call...about the best there is (and oh so efficient)...but even then...the great wake up call only happens provided you go into with with at least some intent, and of course careful set and setting......or sheer luck.   Outside of snuff users in South America who value it as a Plant of the Gods.....not a lot people seem to get the consistent results I do (both on a personal level, as well as when providing a 'session' for others)...so I think it took a lot of work on my part for me to be so confident with it.


Re: Yoga......5-MeO-DMT is yoga on steroids.  Yoga, meditation, out of body work, etc actually take as much work as I am saying you will need to put into 5-MeO-DMT.


It's all well and good to have a mystical experience and see great 'truths' and feel oneness.  You still will come right back down without work, practicing good intentions, showing your knowledge by example, etc...you know...what they call, 'walking the walk.'


When I provide a session (and I never smoke it with the initiate), I put an ENORMOUS amount of personal energy into....and when all is done and they are down.....I remind the initiate that only by working in the same way I did to provide the space they enjoyed will they be 'changed.'  When he was all down, my friend said "Holy shit my life is changed." and I reminded him that nothing in his life has changed...the 5-MeO-DMT was only was a wake up call...etc...same cliches I used earlier.....but they are all true.

I haven't had much luck vaping it. Last time I did it I vaped 8mgs in my oil burner hit it perfectly and held it in a long time but still only got mild effects. From every thing I read in the past that  should be a breakthrough dose. Think I'm better off just plugging it.

What dose would you recremmend for a plugged dose; does 5mgs sound good?

I used to love 5-meo-dmt. I smoked a good amount of it over a few years time. I went through a period where I had breathing problems on it and ended up have chronic breathing problems around that time. 


I had always trusted this substance until them and wrote off reports of breathing problems as anxiety and fear. Now I do not believe they are just anxiety and fear I believe this substance can cause respiratory problems in some people.   


I am not saying people should not do it.. I am just putting some cautionary info out their about a research chem. Come to your own conclusion. 


This is my trip report about problems I had with it- [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/688315-5-meo-dmt-3-years-of-use-until-breathing-problems](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/688315-5-meo-dmt-3-years-of-use-until-breathing-problems)


This is taken from TIHKAL  #38. 5-MEO-DMT 

*“”(with an unknown but large amount, smoked) I observed the subject pass very quickly into an almost coma-like state. Within seconds his face became purple and his breathing stopped. I pounded his chest, and breathed for him, and he seemed to emerge in consciousness, with the comment, "This is absolute ecstasy." He stopped breathing a second time, and both heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was provided. Again, he recovered and managed to maintain a continuing consciousness and achieve a partial recovery. In the awake condition he was increasingly lucid, but on closing his eyes he became possessed with, what he called, "The energy of terror." He could not sleep, as upon closing his eyes he felt threatened in a way he could not tolerate. Three days later, medical intervention with antipsychotic medication was provided, which allowed the recovery of an acceptable behavior pattern in a few more days.””*

3rd go last night, and first 'full OBE' experience with IMed 5-MeO-DMT.  I think it is clear that IMing this IS stronger than smoking it.  I sorta thought that the first two times (each with 3mg or so) and now it is clear.  This makes 5-MeO-DMT strange stuff because I don't know of anything else that is *stronger* that route of administration...and this time there was an odd delay of 10 minutes before it even hit.


Oh what a needed experience, reminded me of why I need to be alive.  Bless my friend for taking me there.  What happened, that is a bit personal but I revisited nearly every 5-MeO-DMT trip I've ever had (and all the lessons learned), and then topped it off with I can't even begin to put into words.


That is not to say I won't vaporize it anymore, but it is clear this method of administration allows one to work with the material as opposed to being blasted by it and back in 7 min.


Yeah, 5-MeO-DMT via IM is the real deal...and all with a measly 5mg!  I can't even fathom if we had chosen 7mg which was my first choice.

My thinking immediatly goes to, 'hard not to trust a substance that is found in the brain' but thats silly as you are taking about smoking it.  Still lots of recent data on endogenous DMT, bufotenine, and 5-MeO-DMT including theories and facts on why they are there...not just that they are....which does speak to the idea the substance is safe to the physical body.


Having said that, I don't doubt your experiences.  I had an experience in September with 5-MeO-DMT that was INTENSELY physical and brutal, the 'bad trip' although there was no 'trip' or ego anything, but a body turning to concrete.....have NO idea why it happened...no anxiety and I was with the most lovely copilot (my gorgeous sexy cousin Fatima from the Empty Quarter of Arabia ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) who I'd been journeying with all week.


But the chronic breathing issues...was this from regular/frequent use?  Most curious.  How long did that last, and did it resolve itself?

One good thing is this compound doesn't seem to degrade ever! Like I said in another, I stored mine for almost 5 years and it still works just great. Indeed, 5-meo-dmt is just beautiful! Actually, despite storing it for so long, I have tried it only once, and I guess I still have to do it a few times more until I can get a grasp on the trip and take the most out of it. It`s all just too fast and confuse!  when I came back to myself I had no Idea of what had happened! But at the same time it felt physically and emotionally sooooo good! The after effects were also delicious, and unexpectedly I felt it was really easy to communicate (even easier than normal). When the right time comes, I will explore it more!


**Edit**:

MGS: [FONT=Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Calibri, Geneva, sans-serif]Now, after reading what you said about IMing, I think thats how I could achieve what I was looking for with DMT and 5-meo: a more manageable ride...[/FONT]

I was gonna try to respond but no words...the 5meodmt works its magic either way no matter what I may say.  It just is.


Re the needle:  cant really tell you not to fear it but certainly in the aspect of it being a tool to dispense a psychedelic like 5-MeO-DMT...it certainly is as acceptable a means as smoking or snorting, it is for sure 'safer' than smoking or snorting....all things being equal with regards to clean needles and sound injecting technique.

Got to try this recently. Vaped 15mg but I think I did it vastly wrong. I experienced a lovely body high and euphoria but no visuals, just an expansion of the room and that classic 5-MeO energy but with no anxiety or any of the nasty come up effects I often associate with tryptamines (aside from Lysergics) - particularly ones with intense come ups.


Everything blurred and overlapped and the walls were wavey but otherwise it was visual-free. I also experienced no intense rush though I felt incredibly hot and was filled with a sense of love and empathy. The dealer asked why I only wanted 15mg and not 50mg+ and said that sounded like a small dose so maybe the purity was also of question.


Nice stuff though, much more agreeable with me than N,N-DMT is frankly.

Yeah wow, 15mg of pure 5-MeO-DMT is an intense dose, too high I would say.  The dealer wondered about 50+?  Maybe the dealer really had DMT, although 15mg of DMT would have given you visuals for sure (well it would have given me visuals).  5-MeO-DMT isn't really visual apparently (I haven't had it myself), so I guess maybe it really was what was claimed.

I would have known that awful taste, the 5-MeO-DMT didn't taste that awful honestly. But I think I burned most of it, I had difficulty smoking DMT when I had that too.

Yeah it's best to vaporize, using a meth pipe or you could look through some old threads and find reference to "The Machine" which is a DMT smoking device easily made from a mini-liquor bottle that someone/the forum invented some 6 or 7 years ago.  The Machine is a really great way to vaporize DMT.


I have successfully vaporized DMT on a bong and a bowl with a lighter flame before too, you just have to be careful not to touch the flame to it.  Better to use a vaporizing device.

Has anyone else here tried 5-MeO-DMT orally? People always state that it's not orally active, but I can say with absolute certainty that it is orally active in the right dose. Years ago (about 2008 ) my roommates and I acquired a decent quantity of "Ecstasy" pills in which 5-MeO-DMT was the only active chemical. If you check ecstasydata.org, you'll see the exact pill I'm talking about. Unfortunately they don't list how many milligrams of the chemical were actually present.


Orally, 5-MeO-DMT was very interesting. Duration was about what I would expect from mushrooms. My roommates and I described the experience as "Shroomy Acid". It definitely had a tryptamine feel to it but rather more "dreamy" than mushrooms, more like the headspace of LSD. Visually it really looked like a cross between the two, though with the visuals being a bit more organic than LSD. There was also a great degree of "warping", I recall trying to relieve myself but the toilet kept twisting and moving.

Never tried it orally, maybe I will after reading this !


My question: 


About this thread in TIHKAL:

(with an unknown but large amount, smoked) I observed the subject pass very quickly into an almost coma-like state. Within seconds his face became purple and his breathing stopped. I pounded his chest, and breathed for him, and he seemed to emerge in consciousness, with the comment, "This is absolute ecstasy." He stopped breathing a second time, and both heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was provided. Again, he recovered and managed to maintain a continuing consciousness and achieve a partial recovery. In the awake condition he was increasingly lucid, but on closing his eyes he became possessed with, what he called, "The energy of terror." He could not sleep, as upon closing his eyes he felt threatened in a way he could not tolerate. Three days later, medical intervention with antipsychotic medication was provided, which allowed the recovery of an acceptable behavior pattern in a few more days.


Is there any more (background)  information on this story out there ?

Years ago (about 2008 ) my roommates and I acquired a decent quantity of "Ecstasy" pills in which 5-MeO-DMT was the only active chemical. If you check ecstasydata.org, you'll see the exact pill I'm talking about. Unfortunately they don't list how many milligrams of the chemical were actually present.

It definitely had a tryptamine feel to it but rather more "dreamy" than mushrooms, more like the headspace of LSD. Visually it really looked like a cross between the two, though with the visuals being a bit more organic than LSD. There was also a great degree of "warping", I recall trying to relieve myself but the toilet kept twisting and moving.

35 mg orally was about as active as I'd have expected from ~5 mg nasally or something. I did not go higher yet, since I usually end up with a slight headachy sensation, which is quite light, but a seems a subtle warning sign. Still, in undetermined time, I plan to test the higher dosages carefully.

Every time I think about 5-meo-dmt, I can't help but shudder.  It's been 3 years since my accidental overdose (20mg of 2c-e) followed by (80mg of 5-meo-dmt insufflated ), and still haven't recovered mentally.  Once you set your sails so far there's no coming back.  The sheer intensity of the experience was just too traumatizing and I still experience certain forms of flash backs, usually extreme depersonalization and panic attacks.  I must say, I have been improving lately and oddly enough I'm grateful for this experience in some ways.  For example, it radically changed my views on philosophy and, for a lack of a better word, spirituality.  I have no doubt that it will remain to be the most pivotal moment in my life.  Treat this insane chemical catalyst with the utmost respect, not something to take lightly, so proceed with caution.


Been hesitant to do psychedelics again, but I feel it's been long enough and perhaps another trip is in call, as i believe it'd be therapeutic in some ways.

No, not in detail, although I did submit one to erowid sometime ago.  It's a hard experience to construct in words.  Anyways, this particular tryptamine can provide some of the most intense experiences one can endure and I foolishly underestimated the power of such a substance.  Probably didn't help I accidentally insufflated roughly 80mg on top of my peak from 20mg of 2c-e, inducing a state of catatonia accompanied by  never ending perpetuating feelings of fear/anxiety, but  I'll try to locate a link to my trip report though.

Since my last traumatizing experience with 5-meo-dmt, I've always wanted to undergo another trial  to see if I can resolve some of the issues that arose in my last session.   I'm just concerned because I had completely lost my shit, catatonic, ddnt know who I was or where. I consider myself experienced with various psychedelics and I've endured many of horrible trips, accompanied by complete ego loss, but this last time was different.  Its been 3 years now and I still get severe anxiety, dissocciation, cognitive issues, my sleep paralysis resurfaced.  Maybe I should keep clear, might not make it back next time lol.

Tried vaping 5-meo-dmt several years ago and decided it was not for me. 5mg vaped was a *very* unpleasant experience. I remember meditating and feeling like I was sweating buckets, just waiting for it to end.


Recently found 20mg in a baggie and, being a masochist, decided I should do *something *with it. I disolved 20mg into 1ml of some typical e-liquid (PG/VG mix) and put it into a typical 510 e-cigarette. I knew that this would result in a minuscule (i.e. threshold) dose (ex a few puffs probably equal 1mg), but that's fine given my previous rough experience.


My 510 battery has a variable voltage dial going from 3.2V to 4.8V. With several puffs at 3.2V I didn't feel anything, so I pumped it all the way up to 4.8V. There we go. With one good draw I immediately felt threshold effects. I did a few more draws and felt the familiar feelings, albeit at threshold level. I was already sweating so I stopped there. I meditated (what else can you do when you have no idea why you put yourself into this position?). It was interesting, but not enlightening.


I think I will try again with a bit more, though I'm still not sure if this chemical is for me. I've still never got much out of it other than some bizarre and not-altogether pleasant feelings. Maybe I need to do a breakthrough dose, but I'm not going to do that in this lifetime. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


All this to say: Standard e-cigarette seems to be a viable delivery device for this one, though the vapor was very harsh to hold in for the typical 10 seconds. Since the required dose is so much smaller than DMT, I assume that one could easily dissolve a high enough concentration to breakthrough this way. Not sure if you'd want to, though.

5-MeO-DMT seems to be one of those compounds where anything sub-breakthrough is unpleasant to most people. I am prone to physical side effects on psychedelics, so it's not really on my list of things to try...

This is the case even for me, and I LOVE 5-MeO-DMT.  Anything short of a full, breakthrough, out of body dose tends to be unpleasant and physical in nature.  Once you get above a certain threshold (7-12mg or so, in one hit), the body ceases to exist and you are not aware of it again until the effects are declining.  For many people, an MDMA-like afterglow is what is noticed.

After a break through, even the smaller dosages became pleasant or at least sometimes neutral for me. It gives a lot of body energy though, which can be overwhelming.

I have 5-MeO-DMT Hydrochloride powder stored at room temperature in normal conditions in sealed bag 3 years. Do you think there will severe degradation 5-MeO-DMT which I had for about 3 years? Want to use it via IM route.

Actually, despite storing it for so long, I have tried it only once, and I guess I still have to do it a few times more until I can get a grasp on the trip and take the most out of it. It`s all just too fast and confuse!  when I came back to myself I had no Idea of what had happened! But at the same time it felt physically and emotionally sooooo good! The after effects were also delicious, and unexpectedly I felt it was really easy to communicate (even easier than normal). When the right time comes, I will explore it more!

I had a few lower doses which weren't too unpleasant - it's just surender or being swept away with this stuff - it still has a lot of power but it is also amazing how fast it cleared at smaller doses leaving a clean feeling. Snorting was pretty awful as well as oally (MAOI). Most of my attempts at writing reports on this have fallen short though.

5-MeO-DMT is the first, and possibly only, psychedelic that I would do again if I got back into psychedelics. MGS and I are of one mind on the stuff ... as I remember from the last time we talked about it we could probably have our very own 5-MeO-circlejerk thread ... it's friggin incredible and was [responsible for probably my only ++++ experience](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/527162-5-MeO-DMT-But-A-Little-Lower-Than-The-Angels) and I don't even really believe in ++++ experiences (and also don't really believe in writing trip reports ...) so yeah, it's that good. Not for everyone though, not for the faint of heart and certainly not to be over-done (as I mention in my TR, I smoked an unmeasured amount of a degraded material, don't do this ... and, *obiter*, if anyone still has that reddish hygroscopic material that widely circulated some time ago, it's still pretty damn good, but I digress) Not to be under-done because as MGS says:

*Surrender or be swept away* is pretty apt. I found underdosing to be grating though. Oral 5-MeO-DMT/MAOI sounds gross and potentially dangerous. Snorting sounds gross and a waste of time. As will surprise many people who know me, I never injected the stuff but that was largely because the material I had was freebase, reddish and with the rough consistency of BTH, so even I wouldn't go near it with a rig ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

5-MeO-DMT is a 5-substituted tryptamine, which are pretty stable (unlike 4-substituted ones) + it's a salt, which again is more stable than freebase, so there shouldn't be ANY perceptible degradation.

It's also a waste of **dose**.


I tried it, the drip is **disgusting** and 15-20mg snorted is equivalent to 2.5mg IM (the onset and duration is about the same).

If you recommend lye I'm guessing sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate is too weak a base, would calcium hydroxide work though?

The pKa of 5-MeO-DMT is 9.3 (Ghosal & Mukherjee 1964).


With 1N aq sodium carbonate you get a pH of 11.6 meaning that it should be enough of a basic solution to convert the majority of your 5-MeO-DMT seeing as there is a pH difference of 2.


![200px-Weak_acid_speciation.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2Fa%2Fab%2FWeak_acid_speciation.svg%2F200px-Weak_acid_speciation.svg.png&hash=e2d521c1e786158ee0bb917e30eeadcb)


Higher pH should be more resolute and quick, if you play it very close that means that you have no excess to rely on and that you will just have to apply more vigorous mixing and waiting to make certain.

Lye is just easy to get a very high pH, I don't know why other bases could not be used but if you need a lot of a certain base to achieve your needed pH one might argue that leaves your conversion mixture much less dilute and pure. In this specific case that is probably not much of an issue if inorganic bases are used that don't readily dissolve in your non-polar (e.g. naphtha) anyway.

im kinda confused on this one while it clearly has out of body expierences and induces ego death like regular dmt i have heard that this is not very visual. im thinking of buying some while i still can. i have never done dmt or 5 meo dmt what should one expect on his first trip, and also do you need a methamphetamine type globe pipe to smoke this substance. smoking seems to be the best roa.

any advice would be beyond helpfull thanks,

yes. a MA type pipe is perfect. i.m. is also good apparently although I haven't tried it. i,v. is not realy advisable.

and if you have the freebase product which can be off color, hygroscopic, don't think it's bad stuff, it's really quite good

that's the only one that I got and that's what produced my ++++

if you have pure white powder/hcl stuff then I might just jump right to i.m.

I am going to be getting gifted 5-meo-dmt this week hopefully.  I have a fair bit of experience with nn-DMT, but none with the 5-meo variety, which to be perfectly frank scares me shitless (based on the trip reports).  I have reached a crossroads in my life where I feel I need a psychedelic experience such as that 5-meo might offer.  However, I am undergoing a BIT of stress (lost my job, I wasn't particularly attached to it but it is certainly going to cause me relationship problems with my family).  I also have being going pretty heavy on the drugs recently - I gave up a 2/3 month heavy opiate habit, and have used heroin and cocaine this past week (currently off but been plugging DHC so not exactly sober).


I am however experienced with psychedelics, and feel I need this experience at this time.  Would I be OK to go ahead, and am I correct in saying there shouldn't be any issue in having a small amount of opiate in my system just to remain baseline if nothing else.  I could maybe do a trial run with nn-DMT to ensure no disaster trips, but I don't know if that will make much difference given the different nature of the compounds.


Also, what is the best way to vape?  I've heard that it chases off foil pretty effectively given that the dose is so low, but I don't know if that would be sufficient for getting the full amount in my lungs at once (I am keen to breakthrough as I think I may only be receiving the single dose).  If foil is inefficient, what is a good method that won't break the bank and ideally won't require any online ordering. (No real headshop type places in my area, might be able to pick up some cheap bongs or pipes).


Many thanks

1. If you do it right, you will go far enough out that your current life circumstances will not really be with you;


2. If you are regularly doing opiates take your regular dose or slightly more;


3. The only really worthwhile way to do it IMO is with a glass bulb ("meth") pipe, or, failing that, a crack pipe ("rose.") You should probably be able to find one or the other.

So snorting it is a no go? I have the potential to acquire some 5-meo; however, I can't afford more than maybe 500-1000mg of the stuff, and it would be in HCL form. With such a small amount of material, would it be wasteful to try and turn it into a freebase? I see you advocating 5-meo as an essential psychedelic SKL, and so at some point I do want to try it... I just worry about wasting it... or freaking the hell out on it!

4. Are you sure what you are being offered is in fact a salt? I don't believe it used to be often offered that way. In fact if memory serves the freebase has been mislabeled as the salt before; this should be able to cleared up quite quickly in the obvious manner.


5. Few people have or are going to have good time with parenteral use. Including snorting. You really need to smoke this material, and for the love of God, just don't toss it on top of marijuana or smoke it in improper glasswear. What you have is one of the most important psychedelic drugs out there, tragically rare these days as I am given to understand, it would be practically a sin to waste it. You need to smoke it like crack or MA, not like pot or a casual hit or two of "regular" DMT-laced marijuana or "changa" leaves.


6. I am shit-tired of psychedelics, regret for the most part that entire chapter of my life during which I took them seriously subjectively, and 5-MeO-DMT is a pretty much the only psychedelic I'd bother to post or even think much about about these days, yet alone contemplate doing, and therfore possibly an exception, so, yes, I guess this is in fact a pretty ringing endorsement.


7. People who freak out usually do either to little or too much—not a very helpful statement maybe, but one that should underlie the reason why smoking is the essential RoA and others are bad news.


8. Adding a little foundation of a traditional psychedelic or even a dissociative is not a bad idea—perhaps counter-intuitively will reduce the possibility of a negative experience by rendering the thunderclap transition from sobriety to psychedelia less of a shock—for this subject but also for general reference, see my [trip report](http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/527162-(5-MeO-DMT-Unknown-dosage)-Experienced-But-A-Little-Lower-Than-The-Angels), which included both.

I not be surprised if it would be lovely if dosage were not under- or over-shot, but this would worry me, and i.m. was, generally speaking always my favorite RoA for psychedelics including 5-MeO-DMT's almost infinitely more forgiving cousin (and much more distant a cousin than people often imply), DMT. I generally advocate not comparing these substances at all, though, except perhaps for duration. I'd still recommend smoking 5-MeO-DMT. Conversion is easy enough.

I've had good success with sandwhiching DMT freebase between herbs in a bong, would this seem like a reasonable way of using the 5-meo-DMT or would the smaller dosage mean you could risk getting less substance in your lungs per hit.  I live in the UK, don't really see meth pipes about much as meth has never really taken off here.  I'm sure I'll find a suitable way though nonetheless.  Cheers for the advice on the other points, so slightly upping the opiate dose will do absolutely nothing to detract from the experience? (makes sense now I think of it, its freaking 5-meo-dmt afterall)!

^ Don't do this. You want 5-MeO-DMT alone and titration of 5-MeO-DMT alone, not "hot spots" on random herbs, and *particularly* not marijuana. You can make a quite satisfactory "meth pipe" out of a lightbulb.

Snorting works wonders on this one. Less scary, more euphoric. Smoking can be a bit too much intense fast. So just slowly titrate. Smoking on a light bulb or a water bong use to work great, but as said, snorting is way gentler and less fiendish.


I haven´t tried to plugin it, but could be the best ROA

Snorting and i.m. are probably pretty equivalent but honestly I haven't tried either, only smoking which allows a little room for up-titration if you dose too low; as I've said before both too low and too high are uncomfortable. Smoking or i.m. may be as the poster above me states worthwhile if you get the dosing right, though, if you're new to the compound that may be tricky. I don't advocate plugging of anything for a variety of reasons but that's a different tangent.

Yeah, I'm 99% certain it's the hyrdochloride salt, the person I'd be getting it from is always stand up about these things. My real question though, is since you advocate the smoking ROA so much SKL, would I have to use the whole gram or half gram in the conversion to freebase, or could I try it with a smaller amount? It's not really a cheap substance like I said, and I would hate to mess things up and lose product or waste any.

The smaller the quantity, the bigger the losses relatively speaking... especially if you are not doing a full A/B type conversion in a funnel and everything.


Also I think 5-MeO-DMT should be more resistant to degradation when smoking compared to plain trypts like DMT... but whether it's worth just leaving it the salt is very hard to just guess.


Then again for specifically 5-MeO-DMT, I never smoked it myself but I did snort and IM it lol.

Looks like tomorrow is likely gonna be the day for me, been intrigued by this one for ages and I feel like the timing in my life is right (not that my life is ideal, far from it... I feel like I need a drastic change of perspective).


The biggest thing that is worrying me at the moment is the pre trip nerves. I often get them pretty bad with nnDMT, along with a wave of panic as the effects take hold.  However, this usually subsides with the beauty of the trip.  I am somewhat confident 5-meo will be similar in this regard assuming I get the dosage right (I'm thinking 8-9mg?), but the heavier nature of the way the trip is described is giving me the fear.  


I will probably take a low dose of an opiate (just enough to ensure no discomfort as I've been daily dosing for over a week, mostly low doses on DHC).  I also have diazepam on hand, but would like to avoid anything that is going to fuck with my memory/clarity of trip too much, which I guess will be the case with diaz.


I've come across some positive reports of MDMA and 5-meo combinations.  It seems that this combo eliminates the pre flight anxiety and unpleasant bodyload, and makes for a glorious trip.  This is consistent with my experience comboing DMT with MDMA - no fear whatsoever, pure bliss.  However, the experience was notably different in that case.


Can anyone chime in on whether combining MDMA with 5-meo will alter/diminish the quality of the experience in an undesirable way?  If it is at all possible to dose on MDMA and get the full ++++ 5-meo experience that gives it the reputation it has, without any notable detrimental effects (difficulty remembering the experience), then I'd almost certainly go for it.  I will have access to more than one dose of the 5-meo, so perhaps I could use with MDMA first time to ease nerves then without thereafter?


Or am I better off just biting the bullet and doing the first dose sans MDMA? 


Christ, I've rarely had such conflicted feelings about a substance, I'm basically pooing myself with both fear and excitement at the same time and I haven't even smoked it yet

Yes, combining with MDMA can be rewarding even +4.


No, don't do it your first time. I like to think drugs are often best experienced alone to get a sense of them, although I've not always held to that myself. 


Use enough of your usual opiate to get a slight buzz and go from there.

People exagerate a bit with 5-meo. The scary stories are kind of mythical. 5-meo is one of my faves, I have done grams of it and in my experience you can titrate the dose both snorting or smoking it. As I said, snorting is way more gentler. Also, 8-9 mgs is a bit too much without tolerance, I would go to 5-6mg, wait for the plateau and decide if you want more/ extend the duration, which will be like YESS, OF COURSE!


The trip is way too short for a benzo to do something. The journey is 15-30min only.


Combining with MDMA is great, but as said, better try it alone for the first time, or with a light opiate in your case.


Enjoy the hyperdimensional velocity!!!

Right, point taken re the MDMA.


Is 8/9mg really too high? I am wanting a guaranteed breakthrough, and don't really want to have to make my mind up mid comeup as to whether I should keep dosing.  I have that problem with regular DMT so can't imagine 5-meo being any different.

In my experience, it works best to get in into your system as quickly as possible. If I vaporize a little at first and try to intensify by doing more, it seems to take exponentially more material to get there, if I really get "there" at all. Extending works a little better, but still I would advise to vaporize it as quickly as possible.


I've snorted both the freebase and the HCl and both felt like a burning pike was shoved up my nostrils. Aside from that, it worked well. The trip starts slower and lasts a bit longer, but I prefer vaporizing.


Personally, in your case, I would try to get a little more and first vaporize a threshold dose. Then a couple of days/week later go for the full blast.

Thing is, while I realise you can't rush these things, I have mentally set myself up for doing this - and doing it the whole way.  Additionally, while I know the trip wont solve my extranious life problems, I was wanting to do it in the next few days as I have found myself in a difficult position and I suppose I am hoping for some perspective (or at the very least, a bit of an afterglow).  Possibly wishful thinking, but that is where I'm at nonetheless.


Also, I was under the impression from reading numerous posts in this thread that sub-breakthrough doses are for many (particularly the uninitiated) uncomfortable and pointless?

You won''t find the former but will probably find the latter. The experience is profound, spiritual, but content-free, if that makes sense (although I believe that *all* psychedelics are 'content-free;' this one is to a [special degree, which is, in fact, why its one of my favorites](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/527162-%285-MeO-DMT-Unknown-dosage%29-Experienced-But-A-Little-Lower-Than-The-Angels-%28-%29).)

Yes, underdosing with this one can be distinctly uncomfortable unlike with a lot of others where underdosing is just a weird buzz.

Hmmm... 3 attempts so far, each one starts with that tryptamine rush as if something big is about to happen and then it doesn't really go anywhere.  I'm blaming this on my poor smoking technique but I simply don't have access to a meth or crack pipe.  Anyway, I've thrown in a tab of 1pLSD to see if dissolving my ego beforehand a bit might help.


Obviously chasing off foil isn't working (as you told me SKL, I didn't doubt you just overestimated my chasing on foil skilzz).  Anyone know of a better way that doesn't involve a bong or pipe?  I'm happy to improv with household objects.


I DO have an atmos vaporisor, only trouble is I don't know the vap temp that this thing reaches.  Maybe if I mixed it in with a small amount of hass/ash this would be a viable way forward?


Please help bluelight, I really want the breakthrough experience.

Well yesterday turned into a bit of a mad bender, I completely forgot to check back in.  I was a bit naughty, and while I understood and respected your advice on taking the 5-meo alone on the first attempt, things didn't quite play out that way.  I started the day smoking strong number 3 (UK freebase) heroin. A couple of hours later, I plugged 144mg MDMA. I almost certainly had a *small *vape of hash during the earlier part of the day, don't remember when.


I hadn't touched MDMA since the New Year celebrations, and this was my first time plugging it.  Dear lord, I wasn't really expecting much of a synergy between the opiate and MD, more just a positve/carefree headspace to launch from.  However, I found myself in a state of bliss lying in the sun in my beautiful garden - the strong MDMA love/euphoria kept me grounded while the opiate had my mind wandering through surreal creations of the imagination.  I have been out of practice of meditating frequently for over a year, but found I was able to enter a deep state of awareness of my wandering mind. (Difficult to explain, but trust me it was tits).  I then had a couple of unsuccessful attempts at smoking the 5-meo off foil (yeah I know I was advised ahead of time, I got a bit arragont here).  These quasi attempts were still interesting and soo sooo blissful - that tryptamine rush, the overwhelming sensations and clarity of everything.  I can see how this underdosing phase could be terrifying from a sober perspective though, my blissed out launch pad probably helped a lot in keeping the vibes beautiful.


I dropped a tab of 1-p LSD at this point and got some advice at how to create a sort of chamber bong so as to collect and inhale all the smoke at once.  


Well, now I've provided the background, I'm at a loss for words as how to explain the actual breakthrough.  It mwas everything I had hyped it up to be and more, and the afterglow was absolutely glorious.  Maybe I'll have a bash at a trip report at a later time, my mind is really not up to it now and every attempt I make just sounds unsatisfyingly cliche, with lots of allusions to "absolute unity" and other such pish that doesn't really paint a picture of my experience.


Anyway, thanks for all the advice.  I found what I was looking for in this drug - a reminder of the awe and beauty of the world.  I just hope I can use this experience to direct my life onto a more positive path.

A solid amount of time. I always enjoyed this one insufflated and IM. It was much more game that way and seemed far easier to dose. I liked the slower onset and slightly longer duration. I could smoke DMT all day but 5-MeO-DMT wasnt as good like that for me at the time. I also enjoyed DMT IM. For whatever reason the majority of psychedelics/dissociatives seem to match really well with that ROA. I'd like to give smoking it a go again someday. It's not in the first line of things I seek though. Maybe someday when I have more money. I had a lot of good times insufflating it so it'd be nice to have again. It was definitely highly interesting. Its to bad they made it illegal in the US but it's not like the legality of a psychedelic ever stopped me before...

Thanks for the reply Help?!?! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm asking how long it will stay stable because to be honest, I'm terrified of this drug... I just knew I had to take the opportunity to get some because if it ever disappeared for good, I'd beat myself up for never having tried it. Trip reports make it out to be the experience of both utter bliss and utter terror in one emotion.

The good thing about these sort of tryptamine is while they cause extremely powerful trips they don't last long. I would simply suggest ramping up the dose somewhat slowly insufflated to get a feel for it. That's how I did it. I'm fairly certain it's pretty stable so I think it would lasts decent amount of time. It defintely warrants respect but insufflated it's much more tame. You can most defintely get out there by snorting a good amount but otherwise it's not like smoking it.

I should be acquiring a small freebase sample of this soon. I won't have much so I want to use it carefully and wisely. My plan is to do some allergy/safety testing titrating over a couple of trials up to 2mg, and then prepare for a real session after a break. Never tried it before.


I've read through most of this thread, and come to the conclusion that once I'm ready, I'd probably like to use a small amount of another psychedelic as a launch pad for this. I think a small dose of another PD will make it easier to adjust and get ready for a 5meo dmt launch.


A few PDs I'm considering for this launch pad are: 4-aco-dmt, 4-aco-met, 2c-d, 2c-e. Whichever one I choose I'll take a very light dose, eg for 4-aco-dmt around 6-10mg. Then I'll go for about 7mg with the 5-meo-dmt, after the peak of launch pad.


Wondering what experienced 5-meo-dmt users think of this, and what would be the merits of the different launch pad choices I mentioned. Also if there are other ones I didn't mention that are worth looking at.


Thanks

my vote goes for 2C-D and not a tryptamine which may sort of dull the experience by blending it with "generic" tryptamine-ness, maybe some ketamine. both more or less go with everything.

Very interested in trying this one. One thing im curious about is the reports of it being less visual than nn-dmt. Is there any aspect to 5meo-dmt that makes up for the lack of visuals? I hear its more of a "white out" rather than dmts intricate, fast paced visuals.


Also what would be a good dose to try it nasally? Ive smoked plenty of Dmt in the past and would consider myself experienced with most psychedelics.

don't know much of nasal use but one of these preparations made by indigenous people is insufflated (yopo?) and they snort a huge amount of plant matter that IIRC contains 5-MeO-DMT and DMT; I'm sure some Bluelighters have snorted it, perhaps the HCl; I strongly recommend smoking or i.m. though.


and no it is not very visual; it is actually a very, very different experience qualitatively than DMT; the only commonality they really share is the core DMT, similar usual RoA, and short duration. expect something totally different but as I've said many times one of the only psychedelics that I really felt approached the feeling of the "sacred." my trip report is linked a few posts back

Hmm interesting. I only thought about nasal because I read some reports of it being slightly more forgiving that way (as much as that is possible with such a beast). 


Only one way to find out if I like this one I suppose... I'll start with a very small vaped dose and potentially explore nasal if I feel like it but im staying away from needles.

Insufflation is good with this one and it is more forgiving. It's defintely possible to go deep that way as well.

I think yopo is known to mostly contain 5-OH-DMT.

it is actually pretty much by far the most rewarding with to enter into the psychedelic states with many of the Shulgin drugs and similar (not to mention ketamine), 2C-x, DMT, and variously substituted-Ts (especially DMT, which doesn't usually impressed me all that much) are great i.m. it provides a gentle but fairly quick come up to a stable plateau with a pleasant fade at the end and tends to decrease GI side effects and generalized "body load," indeed I think this would probably be the best RoA for an actualized program of psychedelic psychotherapy, perhaps with a cocktail of something like 2C-D and a shorter acting asymmetrically 4- or 5- substituted tryptamine.


if I were to do psychedelic psychotherapy, which I have no interest in really, it would probably look like this, doses from my rough recollections and possibly totally inappropriate 


all of these are of appropriate time lengths for billable hours for most payers


not necessarily given all at once


stage 0: 75mg ketamine, i.m.

stage I: 7-10mg 2CD, i.m. 

stage Ib: add 100mg ketamine

stage II: 12mg 2CD and 40mg DMT, i.m.

stage III: 15mg and 25mg 4-HO-MiPT, i.m.

stages IIb and IIIb: add 150mg ketamine 

stage IV: 200mg ketamine, 20mg 4-AcO-DMT, 20mg 2C-D, i.m.

stage aleph: all of that plus a higher doses of 4-AcO-DMT and 10ish MG of 5-MeO-DMT.


not quite serious but think about it

SKL: Agreed that 2C-D should be a good platform for the 5-MeO-DMT to launch from. I think it would be a good fit because of it's shorter time frame, and the way it has a positive entactogenic warmth with very little psychedelia. I find 2C-D to be a bit like MDMA but without the forced unconditional love, which can feel artificial sometimes. 2C-D has a warmth and gentleness to it that should be great for setting up the stage for 5meo blast off. 


I see some reports from MGS using psilocybin as a launching point, which makes me think 4-AcO-DMT might be good for this too. I find 4-AcO-DMT to be more peaceful, centering and sedentary than mushrooms, all of which seem conducive to this purpose. Unlike 2C-D, it has a fairly clearly defined peak, so that might make it more powerful as a tool, or maybe just more finicky to get the timing right. 


I think you're on to something about going IM for therapy, would work better than oral given the timeframes for therapy sessions. Too bad a lot of people would be put off by needles, so many people are squeamish just getting an immunization, so it might put patients off to a bad start for a psychotherapy session to start out with a "scary" injection. Maybe in PD therapy, people like that could do oral doses, and hang out in a nice environment like a garden or something until the dose kicks in.


I'm not sure about some of the doses there tho, seem a bit high at the latter end of the stages, but I'm no psychedelic therapist! Maybe by the time a patient gets to stage III+ they have some tolerance too.

hi


i've had some in 2 different places:


- 20 celsius degrees most of the year. 2 months long summer at around 30 celsius. goes up to 40 for a few days: crystals stable for 10+ years


- 30 celsius most of the year. doesn't get cooler at night. 3 months of freaking hot 30-40 celsius: it melted on a particularly brutal hot season. it still works, but not practical to work with

Anyone have tips for reducing the pain of insufflation with 5-meo-dmt? I have it in HCL.

Some ideas I have:


-The powder is kind of chunky so I chopped it up, maybe it needs to be chopped even finer?

-Maybe dissolve it in water or a bit of vodka and spray it in?

-Some reaction to convert it to another form (is the HCL form corrosive?)

-some numbing agent (K, lidocaine)

-grin and bear it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I haven't put a lot of different things up my nose, but this was the most painful thing I've ever snorted. It was very distracting for the first part of the trip, then I rinsed my sinuses out and it was fine and the trip manifested.

For me personally the best way to reduce the pain is to vaporize it instead. Both insufflation of the HCl and the freebase hurt like hell.

^^Yes but how does one vape it if they have the HCL, which seems to be the form it's around in now? Such as in my case, I have 500mg in HCL form.

Cream gravy: it shouldn't be too hard to convert it to freebase if you wanted to vape it. I've read various teks for this.


Personally, my instincts tell me not to vape it, feels very unhealthy to me. Could be entirely irrational, but I think I'd rather bear the pain of snorting it. Also, the expanded duration is appealing.


But ideally I'd love to find a way to bypass the distracting pain of snorting the HCL form. Any ideas would be welcome.

You could IM it. It works pretty well. I found low doses effective and it doesn't really smash in with as much rapidity. You get some brief time to build up to the intenstiy/terror.

IM seems like a good way to go with this chemical. I don't have an aversion to needles, but I would be a little sketched out injecting a non-medical grade RC. A sub-micron filter would improve safety, but those are a bit pricey and hard to come by it seems. 


How does the timeframe/course of action compare IM vs insuff?

Yeah, filter filter fiter. I got a gram or so of this and its lasted me for ages and I first IMed it when I was more careless. I survived it, I assume the product is relatively sterile. 


I've never snorted it to be honest, so cannot compare, only smoked, IM/IV (rare) and I've tried it sublingually but it was incredibly disgusting and hard on my mouth. In comparison to smoking, it takes longer to peak and last slightly longer. I try and avoid the 'whiteout' sensation, I don't feel like that's all that safe. I love this chemical, I would take it only twice a year if that, but I don't like how much it speeds up my heart rate.

Yeah it really does make your heart jump.. I doubt it goes above the '220 minus your age' limit though and none of it lasts *that* long. For me it's more the combination of such bodily sensations with the panicky feelings that come with the intensity. All that together makes it hard to bear and something to not go through with often IMO.


I never smoked but have snorted and IM'ed it... IM'ed it does last a bit long-ish I think, when combined with a dissociative the timeframe can be even about twice as long as that it seems.


I've always filtered my solutions yeah, better consider it a must with IM, if you don't a gamble not worth taking.


Definitely expensive those wheelfilters but from china / hongkong via eBay or other similar sites you can get a reasonable quantity for affordable prices I believe. Just check the reviews well to get some idea of the quality perhaps? Maybe they sometimes allow more to pass idk.

^What sort of dose range we talking there?


I find it best used in low doses a few times over a couple of hours and some of the physical effects become bearable and a bit more n,n,DMT-like. And regarding the heart rate, I've found that being on a strong benzo dose is useful for the inevitable (for me at least) panic but the heart still pounds. It creates that feedback cycle of heart rate increase=panic=heart rate increase=etc. that we all know and love.


The last time I did it, which was maybe 6 weeks ago I really found it unpleasant and took only one dose. I felt incredibly nasueated and physically paranoid. Couldn't stop focusing on uncomfortable sensations. The comparatively slower kick-in had me with that thought 'I shouldn't have done this...' which is not a good path to start down. I was able to relax a bit, and was on a bit of ghb which helped, but it was uneasy, sweaty and edgy. It felt a bit like being poisoned.

I've tried this with DMT & 5-meo-dmt. I don't really enjoy the effects of a strong dose of either, but spacing out a few mild doses can be pretty good. By the third round, the creepy tryptamine feel that surges through the body is hardly even noticeable, can actually start to feel quite relaxing. It's kind of like a few warm-up doses desensitize the nerves a bit to the sudden intensity of the drug's effects.. 


Still, with 5-meo-dmt, a few extra milligrams too soon is all it takes to go from a pleasant floating-in-space sensation to "Oh fuck.."

@Perpetual dawn 

How was your insufflated experience? besides from being painful of cause. Kind of curious of how you found it.

Yes, it's definitely a good idea to check reviews for generic filters, but if you buy them from EU or USA they are probably made in China too anyway, so I'm guessing there's not much difference. If you look around on ebay, you can actually find small lots of brand wheel filters pretty cheap too, sometimes even shipped from EU etc.

Well its weird, I have had a 1 mg IM experience that really gave me pretty strong and uncomfortable sensations, I was of course baffled - but later I have gone up to about 10 mg or so I think, with less trouble.


And there was that night when I took over 100 mg in ~10-15 mg doses but I was on quite a bit of zopiclone. Which did not stop me from tripping hard and ecstatically. I have no idea what possessed me to do something like that (I guess it was the zopiclone that made it seem like a decent idea, in part), and I am wary about the thought that something like a Z-drug or benzo could make it smoother pretty much every time you'd try.

Might be from being conditioned that you shouldn't take preventitive benzos with psychedelics. Possibly this is an exception, it's so powerful that you can really afford to lose a little intensity and still have your socks rocked. Even with the nearly 40 mg zopiclone I took (probably the highest I ever went with that), it was still quite heavy enough. Then again Z-drugs are trippy, and kinda selective in their inhibitory effect, so it might not be the same with a benzo and it's a risky plan anyway to combine amnestic drugs with potent trips.

Wow I intended to write a quick two line response, but this turned into a mini TR. I guess I had something to get off my chest lol..


It was remarkable, one of the most unique and surprising psychedelic experiences I've ever had. My dose was fairly low as I'm still working my way up with this one. After allergy testing, I insufflated 8mg of the HCL. 


Before we embark, I'd like to mention that despite what you might guess from my avatar and screen name, I don't consider myself a new agey type person at all. I'm very much a rationalist, and default to a skeptical/scientific/materialist outlook.


The first 45mins were underwhelming and slightly difficult - extreme burning and an uneasy mental space, with some slightly depressing thought patterns. I mostly sat and lied on my back, basically in meditation, focusing on my breath.


After 45 - 60 mins had passed, I decided it must be past the peak, and that the trip wasn't really going anywhere. I'd had enough of the burn, so I rinsed out my sinuses in the sink. I was surprised to notice a lot of unabsorbed 5-MeO-DMT in my snot/phlegm. 


I then sat down to reflect a bit on the whole thing. It was different, but maybe not really useful or interesting in any way. And then this thing happened... 


The heat from my cup of tea was emanating a warm, extremely pleasant sensation that triggered an urge in me to open up my posture. I became aware that I was holding in my shoulders, in a protective, introverted kind of way. I was compelled open up my posture more and more and straighten out, and then finally to throw my shoulders back, tip my head back, and open my chest right up. Part of me was like "what the fuck is this flakey shit", and another part was like "just go with it". I chose the latter. And then ... light began to pour out from my chest. It was metaphorical light, and not actual physical light, but holy fuck, there is no other description for the sensation. It was like the brightest sunshine pouring out of my chest, blasting out and upward. My face peeled open into the hugest spontaneous smile, which became a full body smile. It was full on heart-gasm of pure ecstatic joy, intensely, with this light just pouring from my chest, my chin up, head back, chest out, light pouring and pouring up and out from my chest. Eventually it tapered off, and I settled back into a more normal posture, but still glowing intensely with the thing.


This was an ecstatic, energy experience, the kind of thing I've heard about but always thought was bullshit. Actually I still think people bullshit about this kind of thing, but it's made me realize it is actually possible, that this is a genuine thing that a human body can experience.


And an hour or two later, I was in bed asleep..


It's affected my outlook, and the way I hold my posture. My take-home lesson was that I can experience more joy in life by literally holding my posture more open, with shoulder blades back, chin up. I think it's true.


I feel that I've really only just touched the tip of the iceberg with this substance. My next dose will be in the range of 10-12mg insufflated, not sure yet.

Wow yeah that's amazing, 5-MeO-DMT really is extremely powerful, it can change you, transform you, or deeply affect you. Or if not directly then having experienced things like that ecstasy energy can somehow mean a great deal.

I found it really fulfilling, although that night I was just really rolling with it having a blast, wasn't solemn about most of it.


Energy radiating from the chest, yeah mescaline and some 2C-Ts can also really do that, and of course MDMA but that's a little different. It can really blast through hangups, clean you out.

Thanks, Perpetual Dawn ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Yes, that does sound amazing. Somewhat a different experience from what you normally hear people reporting from this. It seems very much a *all or nothing* kind of compound, but you seem to have managed to have gotten something more out of it.


Is there any reason to think, that propranolol or other betablockers would be contraindicated with 5-MeO-DMT? As I mentioned earlier, it could potentially take the edge of the worst side effects, while not clouding the mind like benzo's. On the wikipedia page it says ergot alkaloids have interactions with beta-blockers, I'm guessing it's probably because they are vasoconstrictors. That might indicate it's a bad idea?


I have a couple of propranolol tablets called inderal, and I might try them with 5-MeO-DMT if I ever get around to it, and if there's nothing obviously dangerous about it of cause.

Yeah 5-MeO-DMT seems to act on alpha and beta adrenoceptors I think.. with a beta blocker you'd get a very imbalanced situation since the alpha receptors are still getting stimulated which can then get more pronounced. I think amphetamines are contraindicated for the same reason?

[https://www.erowid.org/pharms/betablockers/](https://www.erowid.org/pharms/betablockers/)


So it's controversial since beta blockers are indeed given in case of amph OD.., and there does not appear to be an actual contraindication between them - but the imbalance is somehow still a concern?


Am not sure what a very acute 'selective' alpha agonist (which is what it would render 5-MeO-DMT to be) does? Could be that it's still preferable over the alpha and beta agonist it otherwise would be i dont know. Dont know if an amphetamine OD is an ideal situation to compare with anyway or call safe. They can't very well block both alpha and beta in that case or you'll be lying on the floor with virtually no blood pressure. I guess it's a necessity if heartrate just must come down.


If coke is anything to go by - and just generalizing from the alpha and beta activity I'd say it is, you should read this (however unfortunately cocaine is also cardiotoxic in a completely different way namely from the local anaesthetic effects / sodium blocking i think?) but still:


> β-Blockers
> 
> 
> 
> β-Blockers are the most extensively studied and the most controversial drugs relating to cocaine-using patients. In non–cocaine-using patients, β-blockers benefit numerous end points, including mortality, during and after acute MI , and in patients with cardiomyopathy. In cocaine-using patients, however, β- blockade can potentially leave α-stimulation unopposed, resulting in pronounced systemic and coronary vasoconstriction. In animal studies of acute cocaine toxicity, propranolol worsened the seizure threshold and expedited death.64,74 In humans, cocaine-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction was exacerbated by propranolol.75 Esmolol increased blood pressure in 2 of 7 cocaine-using patients.76 In 1 instance, blood pressure increased after esmolol from 200/120 to 230/180 mm Hg.76 Labetalol and carvedilol offer the theoretical advantage of blocking both α- and β-receptors. Labetalol, however, did not reverse cocaine-induced coronary artery vasoconstriction.77 In pheochromocytoma, which features a hypersympathetic state similar to cocaine intoxication, labetalol caused severe hypertension.78 When combined with cocaine, carvedilol 25 mg tended to increase blood pressure consistent with unopposed α-stimulation, whereas carvedilol 50 mg decreased blood pressure and heart rate, suggesting that both α- and β-receptors were blocked.79 Recent, uncontrolled studies of β-blockers in patients with CACP report conflicting results. Death resulting from cocaine-induced MI is rare, which limits the benefit of β-blockers while they increase the risk of hypertension and coronary artery vasoconstriction. An anecdotal report of crushing chest pain, cardiac arrest, and death ensuing minutes after metoprolol administration illustrates the potential risk of mixing β-blockers with cocaine.80 All β-blockers should be avoided in cocaine-using patients in the acute setting. Because most patients continue to use cocaine after hospital discharge,53 postdischarge β-blocker therapy should be considered after careful risk-benefit assessment and perhaps should be withheld until cessation of cocaine has been proven. Patients should be educated on the potential hazards of combining cocaine with β-blockers.

Inderal is propanolol so I wouldn't use that. Carvedilol being an alpha and beta blocker (heh weird I thought that was a no no) could be safe-ish?


If you ask me, fucking with your heart rate and blood pressure to help what 5-MeO-DMT does may just make matters worse and way more complicated.

Thanks a lot. Yes, it definitely sounds like a bad idea I had there, and I'll definitely not try it. As I said earlier, 5-MeO-DMT really seems lika a *all or nothing* type of compound, so it kind of seems to me, that you need to accept the whole package if you "buy the ticket", so to speak. People usually say that it only has uncomfortable side effects if you underdose, so that might be the best way to avoid them - Then I guess you'll only have to worry about the terror of having you ego shattered :D If I someday gather the guts for it, I'll probably just jump in at the deep end, and vape 10 mg.


I didn't know that about cocaine and amphetamine combined with propranolol. Way back I remember having freinds who used beta-blockers for coming down off amphetamine. Not good.

Maybe. I've never taken a beta-blocker. I tend to agree with solipsis, it feels like overkill. I don't have any issue with combining a benzo with a psychedelic but it depends on the benzo. I avoid the more hypnotic due to their impact on memory. I don't really buy into the idea that one should face psychedelia with a 'clear mind' or at least I don't think there is any one way that you should take these drugs. There's no rules. I hvae to be careful, if I do not choose the dose correctly, I will get too disinihibted and in that state I often want to take the more powerful psychedelics. I have taken 5-Meo-DMT  anumber of times due to this disinhibition. Its like my subconscious tells me I am ready for it or that I don't care about the consequences. I've actually wasted a fair bit of stuff this way. 


> What's you dose when you IM it, by the way?
> 		
> Click to expand...


Up to 10mg, but more often 5mg. The last time I did it, when I did not enjoy, I took 3mg. As I said, I would slowly increase dosage and have maybe 15mg all up in 4 hits over a few hours. Start low. The physical effect is very disorienting. 


I didn't spend much on wheel filters and they are fine for anything I've IM/IVed. But an absolute must.

I totally agree. I mean, who decided on those rules anyway, if we went so far as to accept they were there in the first place? lol :D 


It all just depends on what kind of experience you want, and every experience has it's own merits. As I just said in my previous post though, 5-MeO-DMT just seems to me one of those "*buy the ticket, take the ride*" kind of drugs, were you just have to accept some unpleasant feelings or some challenging parts, if you want the full experience that is. But of cause it can be used differently and in any combination that one fancies. I've sometimes considered my first trial to be insufflated combined with ketamine. But I'm also very curious, as well as apprehensive, of taking the full monty. Maybe it might just be best to jump right in, I don't know. Maybe I'll never do it again, but then I'll hopefully at least have satisfied my curiosity.


So 10 mg I.M doesn't give you a 'whiteout'?

I agree too, mostly in the sense that it isn't a stipulated rule but a preference. It really depends IMO... alcohol with something like LSD for example is good fun, and one drink might take the edge off or just be innocent and pleasant - but very quickly it can feel like the clarity that is so pristine with things like LSD can be ruined.

If I don't care about all that and am just looking for a good time, then alright - but it can still feel abuse-y just by comparing the potential with what I degrade it into.


I hardly care what the morals are on a subject like that, but sometimes ruining an effect like that clarity can just not feel right in my heart.


5-MeO-DMT is a little different. It's beauty is not really that of a sparkling placid lake like acid (even if the surface of the water reflects insane morphing shenanigans), it's more like a tsunami. :D You can afford to lose a little resolution with that one and you'll still have a very easy time making out the tsunami haha.


While I have not tried 5-MeO-DMT with a benzo, I don't think taking the physical edge off (its a serious whack) really detracts from some important message or part of the experience you have to undergo. It's still so in your face, some cushioning isn't going to tame it in all likelihood. Don't take too much of the benzo of course.

It seems to me it was the early wave of psychonauts, who tended to be a very spiritual lot and viewed psychedelics as sacraments and frowned upon recreational use without some sort of inner or outer exploration.  You can see it in the early trip reports on Erowid, which is what subsequent generations used to learn about tripping, and they looked up to those early explorers.  Unfortunately a lot of those people were pretty elitist about it, when I came to PD there was a whole contingent of old-school trippers, who were just really assholes, shaming everyone who used psychedelics to party or have a good time, shaming high school kids who'd come on and ask a basic question, etc.  It was ridiculous.  But yeah I think that's where the idea of "rules" came from.  I think since then most people have realized that psychedelic use is a personal thing, it's what you make of it, they're not some divine sacrament, but you can view them that way and use them that way and that's cool for you, or you can use them primarily to have fun, whatever, nothing wrong with that.  It's up to you.  Personally in my early days I had some immensely profound and life-changing experiences and I tended to view them as sacraments, but as I've gotten older I now mostly use them to enhance certain activities such as hanging out with friends, listening to or playing music, and seeing live music or going to festivals.  Sometimes for a good camping trip or day hike too.  I don't go for world-shattering experiences anymore, because I've been there, I don't really need to go back, I've gotten the message several times over.  But I don't necessarily agree with the old adage "get the message, hang up the phone".  psychedelics are tools that have many possible applications, and I find that the way I use them now still brings beneficial value to my life, so I continue to use them.

Hey guys, first post here. Working my way through the first launch thread on 5-MeO-DMT trying to get a picture of the different ROA (first go). Sublingual HCL seems interesting but sounds like an almost unbearable taste. Rectal HCL in water sounds interesting also albeit a little experimental. Nasal HCL sounds a bit taxing for the nose but otherwise nice. Generally I'm not that drawn to methods that are somewhat unpleasant - of course sometimes there's a price to pay but I get the feeling that relaxing is very important for the 5-MeO-DMT experience so I'd rather go for a somewhat pleasant method to facilitate that. So that kinda leaves me with vaporizing I guess? Looking into getting a GVG or maybe an Arizer Extreme Q - any of you had experience with that one and 5meo?

In my experience you might find 5-MeO-DMT more than somewhat unpleasant, although it might very well be the complete opposite. Vaporizing seems indeed to be the most gentle way to consume it.

Vaporizing is the most intense way of doing it, it will rocket you up the fastest and produce the highest peak by far, which could be either good or bad.  I haven't tried 5-MeO-DMT, but most people say you need to take enough to completely annihilate your ego, or else it will feel very unnerving and unpleasant.  So in that sense maybe it's the best way, but on the other hand I have read reports of people IMing or snorting it and producing slower, less intense trips.

IM is definitely less intense mainly due to slower onset. I find milder effects relatively pleasant but ive seen peeps get very uncomfortable on this chemical at any dose. For me,  Vaping can be incredibly unpleasant.

Would enhanced leaf (mullein) vaped or smoked have a different onset? Or would it come on just as strong as vaping freebase straight?

While it's a clever idea and has some good results with unsubstituted DMT (even more so as so-called "changa") I couldn't recommend doing that; the dose-response curve is too steep and the method of delivery too imprecise.

Wouldn't it just be even easier /more precise to weigh out? Doing a mix of say 900mg Mullein & 100mg 5meo would yield 10mg 5meo pr. 100mg enhanced leaves. Shooting 1-2mg wrong (for 100mg mix) would in this instance not have significant effect on the amount of 5meo - whereas 1-2mg of pure 5meo would have an affect. Or is to do with 5meo possibly not being evenly distributed into the mullein?

I see, thanks.. It could be done for a single dose I guess. If doing so could HCL be used or would it have to be freebase?

You should use freebase, but I think people vape HCL with success as well. AFAIK, the margin between vaporizing and burning is much narrower with HCL than freebase, and HCL is harder on your lungs (well I've found that to be true with DPT, can't speak firsthand for 5-MeO-DMT)

^ basically correct AFAIK but I've only dealt with freebase; conversion isn't too hard and the method you describe, putting it on plant matter, even for a single dose, is questionable as to what you'll actually be getting, I wouldn't recommend it at all. it works quite nicely for DMT, even DMT freebase with naptha which you soak the plant matter in and then allow to dry, but the DMT is much friendlier in a high dose situation and the margin for error is much, much larger; *changa* (MAOI-containing plants laced with DMT as such and smoked) is notable and special ... but an equivalent of any kind (even without the MAOIs) with a compound like 5-MeO-DMT with a dose at least an order of magnitude, closer to two, lower than DMT, is just not at all advisable

Thanks both.. HCL->Freebase: This method seems pretty simple. Is it advisable?


----

- Carefully weight what you need with a 0,001 g scale (milligram  accurate), for exemple 100 mg (so it can be anything from 8 to 20 doses  of vaped 5meo depending what dose suits you or what state you want to  achieve (from 5mg to 15mg generally, higher can be way too much for most  poeple)


- Then dose half of what you just weight (in this exemple we choose 100mg) so 50mg sodium carbonate.

- Mix them and crush together in a spoon.

-  Add enough water to cover the mix of base and tryptamine (distilled  water is best so neutral pH and less impurities in end product.)

-  Then warm up carefully with a lighter, it will bubble a bit as the water  evaporate, as soon as it looks like wet but watery anymore, stop  warming up.

- leave the wet mix to dry completely.

- Once dry I  simply add water again to see if it was now insoluble and it is, so  simply filter the water (which can pick up the excess sodium carbonate)  and save the solid (or scrape them).

Excess sodium carbonate should usually be just as harmless as the tablesalt you will get in your product from doing that conversion. It would decompose when heated, yes, but just makes carbon dioxide and sodium oxide. You only don't want the sodium oxide to somehow get in you, for example if you are smoking the tryptamine hard and it produces sort of hot 'spatter' - though you don't want to inhale hot spatter either - trust me, been there. Other than that, the sodium oxide stays solid when heated and does nothing.


If you do want to get the excess sodium carbonate out, I would personally dissolve the freebase tryptamine in a non-polar solvent instead (like naphtha) - those dry a lot better than water and shouldn't dissolve the sodium carbonate as long as there is no water present. Seems easier.


Distilled water being necessary here depends on where you live and what the tap water is like. It would not be necessary here.


Methods like that work and are advisable I guess. I used to do this conversion in a much more voluminous solution and that causes the insoluble freebase trypt to float as oily stuff on top but it makes much more of a mess than just letting a little bit dry out.


It's also possible to do this with other bases I'm sure... but it would require different amounts.

It would decompose when heated, yes, but just makes carbon dioxide and sodium oxide. You only don't want the sodium oxide to somehow get in you, for example if you are smoking the tryptamine hard and it produces sort of hot 'spatter' - though you don't want to inhale hot spatter either - trust me, been there. Other than that, the sodium oxide stays solid when heated and does nothing.

Thanks Solipsis! So just to make sure I understand you correctly: in the last step you add naphtha instead of water and filter the excess solid sodium carbonate and then evaporate?

Yeah I'm the same way.  33 and people guess I'm 25 when they meet me.  I feel young too.  I see photos of people I went to high school with on facebook and they look old, way older than me.  I guess having kids and getting into a stressful work rut and abandoning your youth will age you pretty quickly.  I consider myself youthful, therefore I am.

I've always been pretty skinny but started working out post-ibogaine and gained 25 pounds of muscle.  Now just very recently I have noticed my body fat percentage has been creeping up.  So weird for me.  I'm not even skinny anymore, just normal.  Right after opiates, I was 135 (and deathly skinny), now I'm 175-180 depending on the day.  6 feet tall.

I'm still just dipping my toes in the water with it, but my impression so far is that the fearsomeness of it is kind of hyped up. I reckon if you're careful about your dosages and work your way up with it, starting very low, you've got nothing to worry about as an experienced tripper. 


I haven't pushed my dose up past 8mg insuff. yet, so maybe I'm still naive ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

still can't believe that you haven't tried it, Xorkoth, and I'm sure mgs will militantly agree; seriously, it's the alpha and omega of psychedelics. one good hit of it and I would almost venture to say you don't need to trip anymore. everything that psychedelics do on what's perceived as a sort of satori/nirvana/enlightened "spiritual" sense is what 5-meo-dmt does, and it doesn't do much else. it's also neither positive or negative except in the sense that the former feels positive, i.e. it doesn't get you 'high' in the way that most psychedelics do. this is which is why it scares the shit out of some people, because of the purity of it's action on nothing-but the essence of psychedelia. you trip a lot. you'll dig it. it has a sort of analogue in the dissociative "hole," I guess, but of course in a totally different way, but I mean in terms of totality of experience, combining it with something like ketamine and riding on top of another psychedelic (as I did in one of my only trips that I wrote a TR for) really will get you there if nothing else will.

Yeah I am the same way about DPT.  I have some, haven't used it yet.  My plan is to IM some, probably 35mg and then 65mg the next time (I have 100mg).


Yeah I figured, I dunno, I just have gotten used to not trying it.  Also would have to find some first.  I certainly will do it when I feel the time is right.

Yeah I'm real glad I sourced some before my source stopped having it. I had no idea it was disappearing, so good unconscious call, self 8(


Still haven't tried it, but I have 500mg HCl sitting in a vile, waiting for the day I'm prepared to make that final psychedelic step.

I remember a friend IMing some if this and just rubbing his face frantically and repeating "I'm so unhappy, I'm so unhappy...". He was probably just before ego loss/whiteout. He didn't recall much and certainly not what he said or felt. This chemical can be really dysphoric. 


MGS, IMing has slower onset and, for me, this allows me to reduce panic. I am less taken by surprise. Though, like salvia, I never really recall that I'm on a drug during it. Its why I prefer repeated low doses, I think the ego-death experience is probably an overdose. I think we should be looking at doses of 1-2mg. Like salvia which I think people are overdosing on too.

Hi


I only tried this the last time I insufflated, so I don't know if it just worked randomly or if it's actually an efficient method, but it worked marvels:


Just after sniffing it, lie on your back with a pillow under your shoulders and your head bent backwards. Do the rest of the sniffing (to make it go down) while in that position.


Not only was the pain very light, but it also only lasted for a minute or so.

Usually, whenever I sniff something, my nose quickly gets stuffed up. It did the opposite. It felt like my nostrils were 3 inches wide and breathing cubic meters of air at once.

Thanks for this tip vegan, this really did the trick for me for the last 2 times. I sniffed the 5-MeO-DMT, then lay down with a rolled up blanket under my shoulders, and a smaller roll to support under my neck. It tilts my head back so that the powder sits in the back of my sinuses just right, easy to absorb it.


I highly recommend this method.


I also chopped the powder up really fine with a razor until it was an extremely fine dust. I think this helped with absorbtion and making it less painful too.


Wow, 5-MeO-DMT works.

Α/Ω of psychedelics, there's not much more to say. This is such an elegantly simple molecule,


![](http://psychedelictimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/5-MeO-DMT-molecule-vs-DMT.png)


so few steps away from the serotonin itself (5-HO-T; poetically but aptly, you could describe this molecule as "serotonin with wings") which is the ordinary diet of the receptors it targets, but so powerful, and it just manages to cut through all the noise that comes with a lot of other drugs (including unsubstituted N,N-DMT, which I see as entirely noise, and LSD, which has immense depths and heights but also involves a lot of extraneous sensations, perceptions, and such.) There are a lot of niche drugs out there, including the fairly chemically close, and close in dosage, 5-MeO-DiPT, horrible stuff IMO (in longer chains, asymmetry seems to be more rewarding, cf. 5-MeO-MiPT, and 4-substituted-MiPT) which is about as far away subjectively as you can get from 5-MeO-DMT.


But for people exploring the deeper side of things, look no further; I don't believe in "content" to the psychedelic experience, but I *do* believe there to be something in the essence of the experience which taps deeply into fundamental human needs, and as I've said before many times, 5-MeO-DMT does nothing but do this, which is why many people aren't getting what they expect, and, not doing so, tend to somatize the experience or otherwise go into bad places of existential terror, etc.—often this is a question of dose but also of set/setting; expecting in any sense a "typical" psychedelic experience is the wrong approach to this particular drug.

The "wings" are also the reason why serotonin can't cross the BBB, but 5-meo-dmt can (b/c the "wings" are "shielding" the hydrophilic O and N, that's why 5-meo-dmt is lipophilic enough to cross the BBB (with a logP of ~2 it's actually **perfect **for that))

SKL I agree with your description.


It's hard to talk about 5-MeO-DMT because the experience *is* non-content. Almost any description feels like a defilement, or missing the point, because the nature of the experience is outside of categories, measurement, division. If you're thinking about it, that's not it. It's a non-intellectual experience, a connection to the deep ground state of consciousness.


As a psychedelic, it's transparent, it's almost as if it's not there. 


That's my take so far.. I'm still green with this.

Yes, it's bascially like GOD sent angels with wings, so that 5-meo-dmt can fly through the pearly gates (BBB) up into heaven (the brain),

I'm not a huge reader of poetry, although I write [the occasional verse](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/807450-Portrait-of-a-Memorandum-at-99-Years—a-poem), now and again, usually on pretty classical models (although I do think it takes a bit of a "psychedelic" perspective, I guess you'd say) and like to put a poetic inflection on my [prose works](http://esotericpharma.org/katja.pdf) (which *is very much psychedelically influenced* and not just in subject matter [this is part of a considerably longer and unfinished text, which is semi-autobiography more or less] but especially in the shifting of perspective, place and time and so on) that I'm a bit more serious about, or dedicate time to.


The "wings on serotonin" I used to describe just what you're referring to, technically, of course, and metaphorically, too; I'm not sure that psychedelics inspired that. Long before I came up with that phrase I was describing the two acetoxy groups on heroin as forming an [Cupid's?] "arrow" to "pierce the BBB" for more effective delivery of morphine; or twin jet engines, if you'd prefer.


I think my [5-MeO-DMT trip report](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/527162-(5-MeO-DMT-Unknown-dosage)-Experienced-But-A-Little-Lower-Than-The-Angels-(-)), one of a few I've written (I generally dislike the genre as whole) has a tinge of the poetic, too, though.

GANESHA is a weird, twisted-around DOM analogue. about all I can say it's supposed to be pretty fucking cool though, but not an easy synthesis and larger doses than most of the psychedelic amphetamines (by an order of magnitude or so) and lasts a long time so probably not commercially viable. my one friend who tried it is also the one that got me my single dose of **ℵ**1/DOT, which was fucking weird but not all that amazing, some of these interestingly-named Shulgin drugs get a sort of legendary status, but from what everything I've heard of GANESHA it sounds pretty cool

I've gotta get around to trying this, but my current life circumstances make me fearful of doing anything immensely world shattering. Hope my 500mg HCl stays good till I finally buck up. I live in a pretty humid climate but keep my substances in amber vials at around 73 degrees F.

Strange that Shulgin never mentioned this, or it's a coincidence but Aleph one is also the cardinality of countable ordinal numbers, Aleph numbers are a sort of measure of different kinds of infinities. Apt name i'd say.

I think I have 25G somewhere, the NBOMe of 2C-G, the non alpha methyl of G.

Yeah supposed to be very long lasting and odd, also non-visual iirc.


Anyway about 5-MeO-DMT, yeah i also have a stash something like that - it was white freebase. Made into solution of the citrate it discolored in the fridge over time and so did synthetic DMT. The DMT turned yellow and the 5-MeO turned pink.

I think the N-oxides..

Add some ascorbic acid next time, well I would but the not entirely stochiometric citric acid present already stung me.. What would 1P-5-MeO-DMT be like?

Hmm …


![](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine.png)→![](http://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/opsin/1-propionyl-5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine.png)


What would happen to the propionyl when smoked? Just break away at the bond; or would the molecule be less stable overall and would it change the vaporization point, and perhaps degrade in funny ways leaving you with not much of anything? I know 1-P-*LSD* is both a prodrug and a less potent 5HT2A agonist (and presumably a lot of other receptors, as with LSD) than the parent compound; I assume this happens in the GI tract but this isn't really relevant for 5-MeO-DMT; 1-P-5-MeO-DMT given parenterally (i.m./i.v.) might not experience this, though (or maybe some hydrolysis of the propionyl will occur in the bloodstream, kind of like Vyvanse …) curious, curious … I suspect it would be no good for smoking which is my preferred route for 5-MeO-DMT (even though I am a needle user in general) and I think the most mainstream one.


1-propionyl-dimethyltryptamine, orally, with an MAOI might be interesting; OTOH some people do take 5-MeO-DMT orally with an MAOI, but it's generally bad news and even I think potentially dangerous.

Recently had my first 5meo experience. This shit is so intense. Experienced my own death while my body was moving in bilateral full body movements. Coming to myself - looking at my friend experiencing us as one organism. It's one level up from eating a pizza and watching HBO I would say ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


Acquiring a portable electronic device solely for 5meo ingestion - what would you get?  


I wanted to get something that was portable and didn't acquire the use of a lighter. I have been looking at enails and vape pens and think that I have settled on a Source Nail. It has both the possibility to function as a pen and as a enail. Then I'll see how the pen function will fare. The enail/dabbing method will be very efficient I'm sure.


At which temp. will 5meo start to burn?

I know nothing about vaping (and care less) but the best method of ingesting 5-MeO-DMT freebase is through a glass bulb pipe (meth pipe.) Putting enough 5-MeO-DMT into some sort of portable device to get multiple hits out of sounds like a recipe for disaster because the dosage range is pretty small, I assume the devices you're talking about are for marijuana, there's no way you could safely use them with 5-MeO-DMT; really, the safe and reasonable way to do it is to weigh it out and put it in the glass bulb, although some people feel confident enough to measure out a dose (harm reduction says absolutely don't do that but I've had to do it before because the drug was really degraded and hygroscopic and wet and gooey and I had no idea what the actual weight of 5-MeO-DMT in it would be.) But *do not*, repeat *do not* put 5-MeO-DMT, or anything with a small dosage range, in a device for multiple hits, it's a disaster. You could use a solvent, soak plant matter (I'd encourage it *not* to be combined with marijuana, but rather something smokable but inert, making sure that there are no clumps or "nuggets" in it so as to ensure a safe dosage) and then evaporate it, but still I think that those sorts of devices couldn't possibly be trusted to deliver a reasonable dose if they are carrying an *unreasonable* dose in them.

SKL, I appreciate your input. You talk in absolute terms (the best  method of ingesting 5-MeO-DMT freebase is through a glass bulb pipe  (meth pipe)). Did you try the two methods I'm referring to before making  such a statement - a vape pen or an enail? The device I was referring  to (Source Nail) is not intended for marijuana.

 I agree that it's  not good to go for a method that requires multiple hits and I would also  myself refrain from mixing it with anything and would prefer pure  crystal. People are reporting having breakthrough with regular DMT - I  have heard over 50 mg being mentioned - from a single dab. And half of  that being mentioned as breakthrough dose because the method being so  effective. So surely that holds promise to 5meo being delivered in one  go.

Putting spice on an already heated nail may be a little annoying -  at least I would think it so. But with practice or if one is already  practiced it may be pretty straight forward. I'm more interested in  pre-loading the device and heat it afterwards. In that sense it would  function very much like a meth pipe. One of the atomizers (buckets) for  the Source Nail is made from glass and would be heated up to the desired  temperature without the chance of burning the crystal (as you would  have in the meth pipe). And in the case of the meth pipe both lighter  and pipe impose risk from their heat. No so with the enail.

There are glass inserts for some or a lot of vaporizers that I think should help take care of that issue but a carrier may still be necessary. If I didn't think my vape pen was so ineffective in general I might have used it for different compounds, there really isn't place for any of the drug to secretly hang out until you smoke it inadvertently.. if it creeps somewhere, the concern would be that it busts the coil.


Wouldn't a nail be ineffective since molten it just runs off it? You would have to build a custom nail made of some highly porous material - probably steel meshing of some type. Ideally it would be a sort of rock or glass fiber that is somehow safe from releasing loose particles, from fiber size not being so ultra small. If metal would be so fine, you couldn't use it either as you'd get the same type of filings inhaled. Otoh it also can't be brittle, just saying there has to be some material that is more ideal.


How do you 'know' that 1P-LSD or 1A-LSD have 5ht2a affinity themselves at all SKL? Cause I didn't think so. Seems rather early for there to be research data, or if there is on ALD-52 it would surprise me if Nichols has been wrong about that. Something like this: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1884/full](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.1884/full) seems pointless as it does not account for mere pro-drug activity...

1. **Solipsis**, I honestly don't remember where I read about intrinsic activity of 1P-LSD at 5HT2A; I read it somewhere more specific but anecdotally think about that IIRC something like less than 50% of it actually metablizes to LSD and the experience doesn't line up with being ½ a dose, as far as I've read (I've never tried 1P-LSD), and that there seem to be some subjective differences in it's effects that's hard to explain by just metabolism, even the differing duration, if it were being metabolized into LSD (let us remember that the vast majority of LSD leaves the system very soon after taking it and a long time before the trip peaks let alone finishes) it wouldn't matter that much, plus a few other quirks, but again, I'm just going on what I've read.


2. **zikzak**, I know next to nothing about vapes and some of the terminology here is new to me. I still would emphatically only trust it for a single dose, not to store doss for repeated use, and I wonder what the purpose of doing it with what looks like essentially a classic bulb MA pipe crossed with some weird alchemical machinery and costs about ten times as much, rather than the much simpler and more elegant solution of using a simple bulb. If you're worrying about wasting drugs you just have to learn how to slide the pipe back and forth and apply appropriate amounts of heat at the same time. It's a fairly easy thing to do. All the machinery seems like overkill. What drugs do you usually do with all of this stuff anyway (you said not marijuana?) I like things simple though.


You mentioned DMT, though,zikzak, and that's really not relevant here. If people have had success in smoking DMT thru this method, and they probably have and do, then that's well and good, but the doses of 5-MeO-DMT are at a minimum an order of magnitude less, which means you have much, much less margin for error. I prefer to smoke DMT in a crack pipe (actually, a sort of take off on a crack pipe, much larger, the stem of a clear glass bong set up with the choreboy and everything just like a crackpipe and the deemsters put on top and smoked just like hard), and, just like the hard, the DMT will start to saturate the chore and give you an extra hit or to. This is fine with DMT. This is *not* fine with 5-MeO-DMT, when you want to be careful with doses. I just don't see any benefit to using these elaborate devices and I see a lot of risk. (I am familiar with basic marijuana vaporizers, just applying heat to the weed and vaporizing out the psychoactive compounds,and have used one before, although I haven't smoked pot in years, and don't like it, Ihad a hit off one of the ones with the bags and it was pretty damn strong. And this is better for you than smoking as I understand and that makes sense. But all of this talk of e-pens and nails and stuff seems a little over-the-top, I don't know what's wrong with sticking with regular paraphenalia ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) but in all seriousness these novel sorts of ways of administering drugs may be fine with weed or hash or whatever but *not* with potent RCs. That's asking for serious trouble. I know people do it, I know people have even done fentanyl this way, which is asking to die; you're only asking for a psychological death trip, but please, in the name of harm reduction, keep things simple. When I shoot dope I could set up an IV catheter and hang a bag of saline and then inject the dope into the Leur-Lock port and then flush it with more saline, but nobody does that, it's a bit overkill, isn't it? Or more to your point, should I take a gram of fentanyl and dissolve it into the saline and let it just drip drip drip into me? Asking for disaster. Same ballpark. Keep things simple. A bulb pipe is the best RoA for this drug.

I don't think vaporizing any chemical is enjoyable. With sometging like this compound I want all aspects as pleasant as possible. IMed doses gives you time to hide your rig and pretend you didn't just inject something.

^No that's obvious but how does it work with 5-meo-dmt?


I mean okay my prior post was a hyperbole, yes I understand the basics, but I agree that I don't see any reasoning behind using such a device for said substance.

**SKL, **I'm with you - my only reason for checking this method out is due to simplicity. I mentioned DMT only in relevance to dosage and in that sense 5meo is easier to produce a one hit takeoff with. And as you mention only for single dose use. I would never consider to store any dose in any device for repeated use with 5meo. 


The main factors I've been looking for:

1. No use of open fire, lighters and so forth.

2. No hazard risk from heated bulbs/pipes.

3. Temperature control - no chance of burning spice.

4. Portability


The only drawback I see as of now is price. I'm willing to invest a bit though if I can get these things in a single device.  


[morninggloryseed](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/members/10564-morninggloryseed), there are quite a few reviews on youtube (Source Nail).


And although Adam Sandler is correct in the clip - no you don't put your weed in there - it's for concentrates ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) But well let's see how it works I'll report back when I know..

Sure it is. And it's a tendency that one must be very aware of I much concur.

It's also easy to frown upon solutions that might be outside one's  immediate belief on how things should be - even though they might be  more efficient or simple.

I might be wrong on this one. I will find out by trail and error. I have  no intention to cling on to this method as being better than a meth  pipe. If it turns out that it's possible to push a button and get a  perfect toke without worrying about open fire, hot glassware, burning  spice (and therefore exact dosage) then I'd think it's a fine solution -  although cost is factor (there are ways of cutting this quite a bit  though). But again, I'll see if it's worth it.

Please excuse my naivete, but what would be the potential advantages/disadvantages of plugging 5-meo-dmt? I have not seen it mentioned yet. Usually the ROA discussed tends to be insufflation, oral, or vaporization/smoking. 


Is there any particular reason why rectal is inadvisable? I've found great results with many tryptamines with this method.

It should be a salt form not freebase, since freebase would not dissolve properly and just sit there burning like mexican food. Also pre-dissolving it in luke-warm water is smart for similar reasons. Other than that I don't see why not plugging it.


Oral hardly works for 5-MeO-DMT and snorting burns - it's harder to pre-dissolve in water with snorting as it would all drip down your throat again, a nasal spray could technically be a possibility. Vaporizing / smoking is more effective than snorting I believe (only snorted and IMed it myself) and packs quite a punch but I do not prefer vaping things like that as I dislike inhaling DMT. Even if you vape right, it's hot and harsh, hits *too* fast and the intensity of the trip makes it messed up for me: I can start to feel like inhaling is exhaling and vice versa or forget how to breathe normally. Not a nice combo for me to vaporize.


I personally liked snorting it with K which numbs the burning and combo's well at moderate doses of both, but it's still not good for your nose. Especially if you can't be arsed to salt your freebase, like me at the time.

I got this batch of 5-MeO-DMT once, it looked dirty as fuck, like reddish-brown and goopy, on account of being hygroscopic, what was and what wasn't water weight would be a science experiment to determine so we just did smallish hits, but the hits were remarkably easy to take in general from a standard issue MA bulb; and this stuff wasn't so highly regarded to the point that it was being sold at an off-price, although to me it was perfect, as it was an easier medium to smoke and the smoke less harsh; what this means for future generations I have no idea, as one wouldn't really want to deliberately befoul their drugs with excess hydration, but whatever happy medium that was, and I'm pretty sure quite a number of Bluelighters of my vintage or older have tried it, it was a good thing wrapped in a package of ugly.

Word 'round the campfire is that someone in the mid-00's kept a few kilos of the pure freebase stuff in less-than satisfactory conditions with regards to ambient dampness, thus the prevalence of the apparently still-circulating-after-all-these-years aforementioned product ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


So maybe, someone with pure freebase could do a little science experiment ... what is not that great looking to the eye of the usual RC kid used to white powders and crystals and stuff might actually be a more user-friendly product


The stuff is still very potent and easier to smoke.

This is probably not the case if it's coming from RC suppliers, but when 5-meo is extracted from plants it can look like an amber resin or gold oil. Stuff I had looked kind of like frozen coke - a sweaty brown crystalline mess. Vaped nicely though.

Hello everyone!! I have a quite specific question. I am on Zoloft / 100mg daily, feeling really good, all anxiety is gone. I was researching a lot about the interaction of SSRI and Psychedelics. It looks like there is no physical danger in the combination of LSD/shrooms and NN Dmt. In fact i have tried DMT on Zoloft, and it did diminuish the effects a bit, but i could still feel it. Now coming to 5-meo, which is quite a bit stronger than normal dmt and also working a lot stronger on the body, i can find almost nothing on the interaction with SSRI. It seems like there are not many who have tried it on SSRI. 5-MEO is in fact chemically very close to NN Dmt, but still a very different drug. I have big respect for it, so I really need some help on this topic... best would be someone who has experience or is really into the topic... so to all you out there, please help me solve this.

> Deaths from 5-MeO-DMT are rare but, as a powerful monoamine reuptake inhibitor (MRI), injury can occur when excessive doses are taken or when taken with drugs such as MAOIs, RIMAs, stimulants and any substance which act as a releasing agent or reuptake inhibitor of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. This has resulted in well documented deaths[9][10] that are easily avoidable and could have been otherwise prevented.

It's hard to say how risky it is, but yes 5-MeO-DMT is different from DMT in that it has relatively high 5HT1A affinity and acts on monoamines quite a bit more as mentioned which seems to be what make 5-MeO tryptamines quite stimulating and potentially less safe than other tryptamines.


More generally, SSRI's with more regular psychedelics are not physically unsafe it seems, but that does not necessarily include 5-MeO trypts. Generally it is unpredictable though, the interactions vary as to whether they potentiate or diminish effects or change them a lot. More often than not there seems to be some limited diminution in psychedelia.

That 5-MeO-DMT is normally taken parenterally and kind of 'overwhelms' your system also does not bode all that well for dangerous interactions. Fast kinetics.


I'm not saying there is a definite threat to your health, for sure, but there might be some risk.

Thank you so much for this really good and clear answer!!


Now here comes a second question that is not so clear: How long can I store 5-meo-dmt Freebase, lets say vakuum, dry and dark in a freezer? How stable is it? Any experience on that? Any good advises? I heard it is more stable than nn Dmt Freebase?


Thank you so much for your advise.

I don't know that answer to your question re: stability, but I think you're right that it's more stable than n,n-DMT. If you're keeping it in a 100% dry, dark and vacuum, it should last a very long time.


I'm writing though just to caution you to proceed carefully with 5-MeO-DMT. It sounds like you're accepting some risk and going ahead with it. Make sure you are carefully measuring your doses, start with very low doses and work your way up slowly over a series, only gradually increasing dose.

Thank you so much for your concerns. I decided to wait with 5-meo until i am out of medication. I had a conversation with my doctor today and we will reduce it to 50 mg the next 4 weeks, and if I am still feeling so good like at the moment, we will continue to run down the medication over the summer, so I have nothing to hurry at the moment since there are great news like this. I will instead try some acid and nn Dmt since I already have some experiences on it last year and it was running really good. I am so fascinated by 5-meo for a longer time, and I have been reading so much about it (toad and the jaguar) or seen all podcasts from Martin Ball, read his books, also read "DMT Spirit Molecule" which was really nice but it was on NN Dmt, than all the Dr. Octavia Videos online. So I will defenetly go on this experience since I am ready. But I am almost sure that it shouln´t be on a medication with this 5-meo. It´s too powerful, it´s the last experience you can have, if you can really say that "you" have this experience because it´s the you that dissolves if you breakthrough. So its really hard to imagine what´s there after this happens.

I have to ask: is 5-MeO-DMT usually more stable because half the time or more it may be a salt rather than freebase? I think they both at least N-oxidize but not sure how the other degradations work... yes maybe the 5-MeO is a bit better to protect the phenyl / indole, but I couldn't say what it really prevents.


If you can, put in some oxygen scavengers (similar to desiccant pack but contains iron filings) with the freebase... other than that I think if you protect it in solid form, it should last quite a while. Lasted a while in solution it seems, but both DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in salted form in water discolored after a similar period. I think in solution it is much less stable, so as the solid you should be okay for a quite longer time.

17 years and counting...5meodmt freebase loses no potency, no color change, etc.  Rarely in a freezer, usually sealed in glass vials in a dark, dry cave somewhere.  Fuck i am feeling old now.  ?

Hey guys. SWIMS new to this. and DMT haha, i've been researching all morning but cant find the strainght answer to if you can just drink DMT acetate while its still in the water/vinegar solution but after its been heated for a bit and had over 40mins to sit. smoking it is a bit tough right now cuz SWIMS not supposed to be seeing Mary but SWIM tried twice now anyways and witnessed what he thinks is threshold? but SWIM would prefer to stay away from weed atm. Alas, all fluorescent light bulbs as well.. Sad SWIM. if anyone could help SWIM out it would be much appreciated. relaxation needed, bought a gram of the sand and just got off my 12 hour shift, so please home remedy's. This why SWIM tried the acetate.

What I said in the social thread... we don't SWIM here.  But welcome again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I'm sure someone will answer your question.  Also I do realize that some forums require SWIM, just letting you know that here it's the opposite.  For readability purposes.  I can barely stand reading certain forums where everyone talks about themselves as SWIM or their pet rat or whatever.

I had 5mg HCL insufflated for the first time. I was quite apprehensive about a bad experience so I started low.

At this level was a quite calm experience with marginal bodyload. I could see it causing trouble in that department on upper levels. Had read of the incomodity of sub-breakthrough experiences but was not the case for me at that dosage. It was easy, and most of my irrational fears are gone. Guessing the danger area might be to get yourself just under breakthrough level. Had my only DPT experience in what I believe was that level and not much fun.


Insufflation was not hard on the nose but the drip was not nice when it got to the throat ala DPT but better. Fortunately provide the small dosage it was not much of a deal. I believe you have to sniff it really softly trying not to get it down your throat. I used child pose to avoid that until it hit. 

When I get to high dosages I am gonna look into plugging as might be the best method for a non connoisseur of needles and an instant onsets avoider. Not much information about it. I gathered is similar to insufflation maybe needing a bit more quantity. 


No introspection at that dosage and nothing remarkable. Quite recreative, pleasant and promising.

Next stop 10mg...

You're doing it right Hypnotist, one step at a time. I think these smaller doses are good practices to get the technique down, acquaint with the territory and starting to navigate into the headspace.


You do have to sniff really softly. I found a tip on here that was really useful: after you sniff it, lie on your back and tilt your head back slightly by raising slightly underneath your neck/upper back with the support of pillows/blankets. These seems to position your sinuses in such a way that they don't just drain the 5-MeO out the back and down your throat.


I remember at 5mg thinking, how will I get up to 20mg insulf with this? But it turned out to not be too bad. The pain/discomfort doesn't really scale up as rapidly as the effects do.

So is it 20mg breakthrough territory? I was guessing somewhere between 15-20 for the level of intensity I felt with 5mg. Even if I would describe it as mild, in a way it was a strong mild effect. It hit me in waves ala MDMA but really different, if that makes any sense. Really different to anything I have tried until now. Kind of a body high with not much headspace. I really appreciated the slow onset. I would never repeat that dosage and as you said it was just a preparation for higher ones. 


Your position sounds interesting too. Might be better as you are already lying down. The drip was alright for me. My friend sniffed it more strongly and complained more. It was his first line of anything so you cannot blame him. I have never met somebody before who took 5-meo-dmt for his first line ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) As a note for apprensive people note that my friend is really unexperienced with all kind of drugs and didn't have any difficulty with 5mg.

Yeah 20mg was a breakthrough for me. Oddly, I also had a mini-breakthough at 8mg (I think it was), but then nothing at 12mg, so I think like any psychedelic, this one can be variable as well. Actually on the 12mg trial I had had a cup of wine earlier in the evening, so I that could have dampened things.


I also feel like it will be possible to have a stronger breakthrough with a stronger dose, I might try 24mg at some point, once I work my way back up again after having taking a bit of a break now. I'll probably do 16mg next time to get my feet wet again first.

I went for 10mg insufflated as planned. Much stronger than 5mg as expected, still ok. Drip got a bit uncomfortable for a while. Nothing too bad but I think I am going to switch to plugging, I just don't want to worry about the drip as I am out there. At the peak, I suffered certain dissociation. Makes me think that stronger doses might get quite dreamy. I still don't understand what this compound is about. Very different for the moment to other psychedelics. I feel like my set is less important than normally. 


Bodyload was very little noticeable. This time no stomach problems at all. Just a bit of increased salivation on the onset but not followed by nausea. But I suffered from certain chest pains which is the normal manifestation of anxiety in me, nothing serious, I can get similar ones when using stimulants. I thought about preloading with pregabalin to keep that under control without interfering with the psychedelic effects. Has anyone tried that?

Took 15mg plugged on the tail of a low dose 2C-E trip. Didn't get much of and effect but it was really smooth. Strangely enough eventualy it just put me to sleep. Now I don't know if 5-MeO-DMT is not very active plugged or it might have had some cross tolerance with 2C-E, or something else. Wish there was a cross tolerance issue, because to get rid of the drip was nice.

There's definitely cross tolerance between all psychedelics.  I'd be curious how plugging compares to nasal, you should try 10mg again rectally with no tolerance and let us know how it compares to 10mg nasal.

That was my understanding until short ago but apparently that's not clear, supposedly some psychedelics like DMT or 5-MeO-DMT don't have cross tolerance with other psychedelics, at least according to Psychonautwiki and some reports. Not have personal experience mixing those with other psychedelics, just this last time. So I don't know what to think. As well, I just kind of fell asleep during what I considered underwhelming effect, but maybe I blackout and I don't remember...probably not, still...


I don't think I would replicate any other experiment either nasally or plugged at 10mg. But maybe I have the chance to compare higher dosages. But if plugging works well, I might never look behind.

In fact I was inclined to try 20mg plugged with no other psychedelic involved, probably the worst it can happen is a breakthrough, considering that ROA was similar to insuffated. But now you are making me doubt...anxiety can probably be an issue with this one. 

On the other hand I don't have plenty of it, and I would like to get a deep understanding of the compound to at least know if I want to purchase more.


It is kind of weird nobody can give us clear info about dosages of plugged 5-MeO-DMT, considering you can avoid the drip...

My impression is that 5-MeO-DMT is slightly less potent when plugged vs. insufflated, from what I've gathered reading reports and stuff. I haven't tried plugging it, still kinda weirds me out.

Unclear dosage in regards to plugging seems to be the same for DPT as well as this. If analogical reasoning applies here in any way, this one should be less potent plugged vs insufflated even if the literature suggests they should be similar. I read everything I could find online about plugging DPT, the conclusion being it's just as effective as insufflation (a few reports suggesting otherwise), and yet I found it to be not near as effective. In fact maybe even 50% less effective.


Maybe it's the same thing here.

I'm sorry but I always though 5 Meo dmt was best when smoked??? or at least it's stonger than oral, unless combined with maoi's.

 Am I wrong  in thinking that?  because if I ever were to try 5 meo dmt I would try to vaporize it or smoke it.....

Best is all relative right? Vaped is much more intense than sniffed (oral is pretty poorly active, so I won't bother with trying oral), but it's also shorter lasting. Personally, I like insufflation mainly because I don't like how the vapour feels in my lungs. But I also appreciate the slower onset and longer period of time at altitude when you insufflate it. I think it gives more opportunity to take in the experience.

It's definitely most intense smoked, just like how DMT is.  But sometimes less intense, slower, longer-acting routes are desired.

IIRC my 5-MeO-DMT is some kind of gloop. I'm unsure exactly because it's in an airtight bag and it was given as a gift.


Can anybody give me any information on what exactly causes it to be in this form; some kind of plant extract or something?


Edit: and how does that change dosing? Would I just have to titrate?

Can have many causes. Plant extract is very unlikely...(although possible, if the guy you got it from extracts himself)

Maybe it oxidized a bit, maybe it's just impure, ...


Maybe you could ask your source, where it's from. If it is an extract, it could have also other substances in it (e.g. Bufotenine, 5-MeO-NMT, DMT, etc.).


About dosing:

I would just start low and see how active it is. 3mgs vaped should give you already quite a strong impression about the activity without blasting you into infinity.

But if unsure, always do at least some reagents testing.


BTW:

For me personally, the best way of vaping is with a cup atomizer. I have a Mr Bold T and it works so flawlessly with it. Nothing is wasted.

If I'm okay with DMT and have plenty of experience with it, do you think I would be okay to try this? I hear it's very stimulating, and DMT is sedating to me. DMT has a wonderful body high for me, and I already have 5-meo-dmt. I've had it for years and I'm waiting for the right time. I read a book about 5-meo-dmt called Tryptamine Palace and it peaked my interest of this drug. I have the hcl but I'm sure I could low temp dab it.

@[ShroomySatori:](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/members/375867-ShroomySatori)DMT and body high???

To me DMT disconnects me from my body pretty quickly even in low dose???

The biggest body high I get surely from DPT. But 5-MeO-DMT also has a marvelous body high in low dose.


5-MeO-DMT stimulating? 

In higher doses it disconnects you from everything, in lower it has a tremendous body load that you just wanna lie down flat. Maybe in very low doses???


I would FB your HCl. Although vaping HCl seems to work more or less, you will lose quite some material and some of it will oxidize during the process altering a bit the outcome.

(it seems some hardcore 5-MeO-DMT people therefore use argon when vaping)

The proper temp window is certainly smaller for 5-MeO-DMT than for DMT, as it needs quite some heat for vaping, but still is killed also quickly if too hot.

Yeah, I think I meant how it rushes over my body really quickly, feels kinda electrictric and tingly, I feel the energy and then get immersed in the experience. So if anything that would imply a rush of psychedelia, a fast come up time. 


I'm still really interested, I think I'm going to try it sometime. I really want to experience a common 5 milligram dose.

If you have the HCl you could just snort it, which is my preferred ROA anyways.

I didn't snort it yet. Never snorted anything.

But just got some HCl, so will try this ROA once. 


IMHO: 5mg, if FB, vaped is already quite a steep beginning and already for most, probably in the uncomfortable zone (if you vape it efficiently), meaning the body load will already be quite strong and unpleasant. If it's 5mg HCl then it's OK.


BTW: Yes 1mg +/- can make already quite some difference with this substance...


But you will probably anyways waste some material in the beginning until you find the perfect tek for 5-MeO-DMT for you.

Soon I should be receiving a sample of 5-MeO-DMT HCl. I'd like to try  snorting it. Is it best to do it all at once or is there time to redose  if you don't take enough initially? I hope to have a break through  experience but I'll only have 30mg.


Also I'll be receiving a few  other goodies that I intend to try soon. I'll probably try 2C-C first  and I might want to take 5-MeO-DMT during the trip. Does that sound like  a good idea or is it best do 5-MeO-DMT by itself?

I've never redosed nasally, but vaporized there is an acute tolerance, so I don't really like redosing.


Personally I would try 5-MeO-DMT alone, in my humble opinion it's the arch-psychedelic, so it should not need anything else.

Tried now the nose way with a little amount of substance. 

Jeez...that burns...

I don't want to imagine how a proper dose would burn...


Like that definitely not my ROA.

But  I read someone had good results with PG and DPT in a nose spray. Maybe I  will try the same with 5-MeO-DMT to see if it's better.

I think it's best by itself too. Before I tried it I imagined it would be good to do some 2C-D first as a launch-pad, but after having experimented with it for a while now, I see that would be completely unnecessary and potentially counter-productive.


I don't think redosing it is super effective, but I did read some report recently (maybe in this thread?) of a guy who liked to vape a tiny bit to get feet wet, then dose some intranasally right away if the vibes were right. 30mg is not a lot to play with to get your breakthrough, for me it was 20mg for breakthrough insufflated, but I worked my way up to that over about 4 separate sessions. Can you acquire some more? If no, maybe you should jump in at 18mg or so. I def wouldn't recommend doing all 30mg on your first try, it could be hazardous.

I think the report you're referencing is the one I wrote about DPT.


A  few years ago a friend of mine had some 5-MeO-DMT and I tried it a few  times. I started with vaporizing 8mg and it didn't do much. I tried  again, I think with about 14mg, and felt trippy and got some visual  distortion but didn't break through. It seems I'm not as sensitive to it  as some people, but it's possible I didn't vaporize it efficiently. I  think I'll either jump in at a 20mg nasal dose or vaporize it to make  the most of it.


I could get more if I want. My experiences with  it before were uncomfortable but I had the opportunity to get a free  sample so I decided I should give it another shot. I'm worried I'll have  a terrifying experience, but then again I've never had an unpleasant  experience breaking through on salvia or DPT.

If 14mg only made you feel trippy, then you definitely vaporized it very very inefficiently!

I also had to find the right way, and this made a huge difference.

5-MeO-DMT is definitely more problematic to vape than e.g. DMT, as you need higher temps, but still the molecule cannot stand high temps, so temp has to be limited.


Today did again the HCl powder way, this time with 5mg and it wasn't as bad with the burn. It seems the higher the dosage, the less you feel anymore...![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I've found 5-MeO-DMT to be uncomfortable and challenging at lower doses. At higher doses the challenge and discomfort is still there, but it's dwarfed by the magnitude of the effects and becomes completely irrelevant. It is such a powerful experience that none of that matters. Nonetheless I feel that the lower doses are useful for getting practice with handling those challenges and learning how to let go amidst them and navigate the 5-MeO-DMT headspace. 


If you seem to have a bit less sensitivity to it naturally, jumping in at 20mg intranasally isn't a bad idea. Maybe even a bit higher than that. I wouldn't go higher than 24mg right off the bat though. If you're going to jump in with a single large dose it might be worth having a chilled out sitter with you. I don't reckon it would be great to vaporize the HCl. 


It's somewhat a "black-belt" psychedelic. Not to put it on a pedestal, or stroke egos, or scare people off, but it does have some overhead to it.

If analogical reasoning applies here in any way, this one should be less potent plugged vs insufflated even if the literature suggests they should be similar. I read everything I could find online about plugging DPT, the conclusion being it's just as effective as insufflation (a few reports suggesting otherwise), and yet I found it to be not near as effective. In fact maybe even 50% less effective.

I tried 33 mg plugged. Effects were VERY light. So in my experience what you are saying seems likely. Stumbled upon another guy who went up to 70 mg HCl plugged before experiencing breakthrough... Seems like a very high dose but judging from my own experience I would say I'd have to go to 50mg before anything more major would happen..

Best way to use the HCl? I was thinking sublingual has anyone tried it this way? 


I am wondering if I could low temp dab the HCl, this is how I use dmt freebase and it is very efficient. Waiting 30s for the glowing nail to cool down and carb capping the stuff, with no water in the rig. 


Not even sure if I want to smoke this one though. I'm thinking sublingual if it's possible I'd likely prefer it that way. Otherwise, I'd likely snort it.

It may be possible to smoke the salt, though I recall reading here that it does not seem fully effective at the 7-10mg range as the freebase is.  I'm curious but it is not the right time for me to experiment.  Beyond that, IMing the salt would work well.  I've IMed 5-MeO-DMT acetate to wonderful effect...very potent even at 3mg.

Oh really? That sounds like a good idea man. I have never IM'd something so I'd have to do some research but I have IV'd heroin 5 times when I was an opiate junkie, at times of desperation. I was thinking of shooting the 5-meo-dmt, but came to my senses. I want to do IV dmt some day though, my preferred psychedelic experience so far. 


Is it really not possible to just take it sublingually? I have 3 grams so the supply isn't much of an issue. That means I could have 1000 IM trips haha. I'd really prefer to use it sublingually if it is even possible, I've been looking for an answer to whether or not it is active like that but haven't found a good response. I don't think I'd vape the hcl it might be harsh, and freebase dmt low temp dabbed with no water in the rig is nice and smooth on my lungs. I had the freebase before, but caused a forest fire that luckily got under control pretty quickly, but I threw it in the woods as I was having a hardcore panic attack thinking the cops were on their way haha. Man... cabin in the woods was like an acidfreak den back those days. The whole town came to help put the fire out lol, I just had bongs and pot and psychs everywhere and was trying to hide them and lost my lovely crystalline freebase. Now I don't know what to do with the Hcl... would really prefer to try sublingual if anyone has before?

Probably not the best idea. I never had a habit of it, almost always sniffed my H but still. I will always remember that colour of my crimson blood and how it mixed with the solution... no worries though, I am so over that. 


I need to figure out if this can be taken sublingually. I used to rail all my heroin too, apart from those 5 occasions of sheer desperation, so I don't like the idea of railing psychedelics either.

Oh thanks for the info you two! I had lovely freebase crystals before, but had to throw them away in the midst of an enormous forest fire in which I thought the cops were coming... so I am stuck with the salt now. I also lost AMT and methylone that wonderful day, and only the entire town, a fire truck and rescue helicopter ended up showing up so I would have been good. 


I wonder why they even make the salt if it is so damn hard to use in comparison? Wish I still had my 3 grams of freebase8(

well, that's his supposition of what will happen if we stumble upon a substance or technique that can consistently generate ++++ experiences, paraphrased from the rating definition. 


i havent used it, but it seems, based upon the enormous amount of reports, that this compound fits the bill..

It is for me...but I've seen troubled souls just puke on it.  No ++++.  Perhaps I failed them somehow but in general it does fit that bill rather well.


Did you guys see Hamaliton's special on toad venom on vice?  Great special... I sure would not give souls 5MeO in a creek with hard rocks.

Hey bluelighters! I've done a lot of googling and poking around the Nexus but I'm super curious what the latest info is! Couple of questions.


Question #1: I'm wondering about 5-MEO-DMT as a changa admixture. There are lots of constraints about combining MAOIs (RIMAs) and 5-MEO, but I'm curious if this is ROA dependent? ie, 200mg harmala alkaloid consumed orally sounds sketch, but what about <5 mg vaporized? How safe is it to combine very reasonable doses of vaporized freebase Harmine, Harmaline, and THH with 5-MEO in a smoking blend? Something like 2mg Harmine, 2mg THH, and 5mg 5-MEO per dose? (purely hypothetical.).


Question #2: If this is just a horrible idea, and nobody should ever combine 5-MEO and any harmala alkaloids under any circumstances, then what about combining 5-MEO and N,N-DMT, possibly even with a touch of 5-HO-DMT (i'm aware of vasoconstrictive effects, etc of bufotenine)... What would be an ideal ratio? I'm thinking something like 5mg 5-MEO, 10mg N,N DMT, and maybe 2 mg bufotenine? This should allow the experience to be primarily 5-MEO but with stoked up visuals, yes?


Question #3: Last question. Any word on the latest plant sources of 5-MEO? I've done a lot of googling, I know about the chaliponga myths, delosperma cooperi, etc... Is phalaris the best source of non-synthetic 5-MEO these days? What's the best variety?

I believe at least a 4:1 or 5:1 ratio DMT to 5-meodmt is very good.  I would imagine virola theiodora resin high in 5-Meodmt would be best if you are avoiding toads.  I dont imagine such resin is easy to find.


Some good info:


[https://drugs-forum.com/threads/virola-theiodora-resin-dosage-and-5-meo-dmt-content.68192/](https://drugs-forum.com/threads/virola-theiodora-resin-dosage-and-5-meo-dmt-content.68192/)


Phalaris sounds not a good source.  A lot contains gramine and other toxins.

Q1: Is a safe and good idea. Not sure about the IMAO smoking cuantities, thought. I would say 2-5mgs seems like under dosing, but let another more experienced blighther to confirm. 2-5mgs of smoked 5-meo is around the sweet spot

If you have the hydrochloride salt it is actually quite active sublingually. I can feel 5mg and it is on par with snorting but smoother. I do not feel like I am wasting any compared to snorting and enjoying it more. The HCl has a slight burn, nothing too intense. Wonder why they switched to producing the HCl it seems the freebase is way harder to find now. Likely to add weight. 


I'm in an introspective psychedelic space off just 5mg sublingually. It is really potent stuff and if you have the salt and have been frustrated not knowing how to use it definitely give sublingual a try. Glad I got a good supply of this one it is very powerful but I trust myself with it. I've held onto it for years before trying it. Sublingual is far better than snorting for me. I think 30mg sublingual would be a pretty heavy trip. I'm deep in thought at the moment about my life or I've been. Also enjoying a healthy midnight snack. It's a good drug and doesn't have to be smoked if you are apprehensive about that.


This one is very clearly sacred I've used it several times now. It can be used pretty frequently due to the short duration, but like DMT I can never keep it up for long without losing interest for a while.

If you want 5-MeO-DMT go lick a toads back, but like give it a poke first.. like piss it off so it shows its venom and take a swab at that. M8 these cane toads in qld do the same things as the Incilius alvarius trip you the fuck out. When in doubt lick a toad

True that. 


Anyone else enjoy this stuff so much sublingually? I have the HCl and didn't know what to do with it for years, but this is phenomenal. Easy to dose, pretty short acting, and overall up there with shrooms and freebase dmt used this way.

Wow sublingual eh? Really interesting. That sounds way more comfortable than snorting it. I'm interested to hear how it does as you scale up the dosage sublingually.

Yeah I was surprised myself. I would have been using this ages ago! I've been apprehensive with it a bit. I don't think I'd smoke it and I have the HCl. I had the freebase, but lost it in a forest fire. I don't like snorting things very much because I snorted heroin for 6 years and I'd like to leave my nose to inhale in peace. But at first I railed it, definitely irritated my nose but I got into that cosmic headspace and had to lay down like dmt, it laid me out like that where you don't have very much time to lay down. 


But sublingual was... hard to describe. It's not really shroomlike but there are similar visuals. It's electric. It's also contemplative and meditative at doses around 20mg. I don't mind "wasting" it because I'm getting amazing experiences and have like an eighth to research. Oh and the first time I took it sublingually I didn't feel it because I didn't hold it there long enough. But after that I definitely felt it strong enough to be having visuals and deep thoughts about my life. Electric, oddly reminiscent of DMT but a very different vibe. It's easy to take if you have a couple hours to spare before bed. Sometimes the next day I will realize I have an afterglow and remember I took some when I was stoned last night. Stuff seems healthy, really. Definitely ramping up the dose. Slowly though, as it seems to be very stimulating. 


I found conflicting info on sublingual administration but it definitely works and is how I plan on using this stuff. A dose like 50mg or 75mg could be pretty crazy.

If you google a bit on 69ron and sublingual 5-MeO-DMT there's some interesting info out there. He also used MAOI's for this.

"30 mg 5MeO orally active alone. Pharmacologically identical to snuffing or inhaling, salt not necessary, all his work was with the freebase.


10 mg sublingual or nasally is a threshold dose for him


3-5 mg of harmaline doubles the effects of sublingual or snuff use."


Also, looking for solubility of of 5 meo dmt hcl.... 

My scale is kinda kife.. gemini "pro" my a..... Looking to weigh out a larger dose for volumetric dosing and evaporate.


Iirc 5 me dmt hcl is soluble in water? Does the brief time in solution/evaporating pose an issue for stability?

It doesn't have to be painful: push the straw deeper inside your nostril, insufflate strongly and bend your head backwards (for example lying down with a pillow under your shoulders).

You will barely feel anything.


In my experience, the doses usually recommended, as well as the idea that the experience is qualitatively different, are totally off.

I first tried with the dosages found on erowid and felt close to nothing. I was also insufflating with the straw only half-way up the nostril and it hurt like hell.

I've however seen at least one report of someone who had amazing experiences with these doses, but it seems he was still quite aware of his surroundings.


By upping the dose to 55 mg and changing the insufflation method, I get to the same place as when smoked. It lasts much longer (45 minutes), although it does not feel proportionally longer than when smoked. The afterglow lasts for a day.

Better than smoked.


I don't know what dose others need. Work your way up.

^ Yeah the pillow under the shoulders thing is what I do too. Works really well. I can't imagine snorting 55mg - I think that would be way too much for me and probably cause me to black out.

I'm certain many have. The late and great Help?!?!? used to say ket or mxe made a great launching pad for DPT; I imagine dealing with 5-meo-dmt would be similar and the warmth/dissociation from a low dose of ket would help get you past the initial 'holy shit I'm one with God this is freaking me out' phase.

It is a lovely combo. [I wrote a trip report about it](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/5-meo-dmt-unknown-dosage-doc-ketamine-classic-but-a-little-lower-than-the-angels.527162/) although I had also taken DOC. Myself and the late Jamshyd (RIP) discussed a little in that thread.

I think there is something in particular to the ketamine/5-MeO-DMT combination regarding the sort of nullity mentioned in the quote.

Sorry for slightly derailing. 


What ketamine dose would you use?

For me 10-30mg is social and stimulating.

Starting at 50mg makes me want to close my eyes and stretch. 

When i go into a float tank i use 100mg.


I am not a regular user (1gr/year MAX)

I have used MXE far more than ketamine, and 3-MeO-PCP/PCE.  But basically I shoot for a light to moderate dose, and when it's taken effect, dose the psychedelic.

I've a had bit this for a while. its still legal in Canada, I guess there is no such thing, its just not be banned yet in Canada. I vaped under 10 mg in a meth pipe and was shocked at how intense it was. I guess I'm concerned by how dangerous this stuff is really. I understand oral with MAOI is dangerous. But how dangerous is smoking? I was reading about 5 meo "shamans" who force water down peoples throats 


![entheonation.com](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fentheonation.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2019%2F04%2FBufo-alvarius.jpg&hash=19a1d8c6281e032ba088fd605163b8ce&return_error=1)


##### Bufo Deaths & Fraud Involving Toad "Shamans" Octavio Rettig & Gerry Sandoval - EntheoNation

A recent open letter has shed light on a history of abusive and dangerous behaviors by 5-MeO-DMT practitioners Octavio Rettig and Gerry Sandoval.


![entheonation.com](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fentheonation.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F03%2Fcropped-favicon-150x150.png&hash=e976ab5e676a0078855dafbd443ea666&return_error=1)

I read the water was to force them to start breathing, which sounds scary. I was under the impression toad venom is dangerous because bufotenine was toxic, but I saw this entry on it in TiHKAL


"(with an unknown but large amount, smoked) I observed the subject pass very quickly into an almost coma-like state. Within seconds his face became purple and his breathing stopped. I pounded his chest, and breathed for him, and he seemed to emerge in consciousness, with the comment, “This is absolute ecstasy.” He stopped breathing a second time, and both heart massage and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation was provided. Again, he recovered and managed to maintain a continuing consciousness and achieve a partial recovery." - TiHKAL


That kind of concerns me. My Covid social circle today doesn't have space for any kind of sitter. I will likely never take a big dose, but in trying to judge the level of risk here, I mean its not like shooting fentanyl. I plan to stick with very low doses. And I have been tripping alone for years so highly unlikely I will jump out a window or fight ten cops. Still a little voice in the back of my head wondering why i don't just stick with DMT/shrooms/acid as there is zero chance of death on those. 


That all sounded negative, I loved this 5-MEO-DMT  experience. I don't have depression so I am not qualified to call something an anti depressant. A few days later and its seems like it has substantial lasting mood enhancing effects. Is this going to effect my next LSD trip tolerance? DMT seems to be magic n that it doesn't, I'm thinking this one might? I did it twice in two days, doesn't seem to build tolerance to itself.....

5 meo dmt can kill you if you stop breathing by yourself always have a trip sitter if your new. Deep in a breakthrough sometimes you are given the choice to die for real and not come back some people take that choice and thus their heart stops and their breathing and they truly die in the real world. do 15-20 mg and you will be screaming no matter your experince while your in non dual state your body can spazz like crazy.


5 meo dmt has reactivations randomly for weeks after the experince where you just ego death out of nowhere its pretty fucking crazy and other psychedelics will forever be stronger.

Have you ever heard of that actually happening [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/) ? I'm not sure I've actually heard of someone dying directly from 5-MeO-DMT. I believe it's possible, but I'm a bit skeptical too.

Yes its why resellers here will only now sell to only trusted dmt customers on the streets due to people not heading warnings and having trip sitters. There have been deaths from not breathing in ceremonies in mexico and south America which is why having somebody with at least some first aid knowledge is crucial for people are new to 5 meo dmt. Only experinced users of 5 meo should even think of doing it alone. One shaman experinced user 300 + trips i heard he fell off something and died on 5 meo from abuery macrus podcast. 


I have been given the option of truly dying or returning to carry on life on a trip before i believe if i accepted i would of died right then and there this stuff is like nothing else. Its more dangerous than lsd shrooms or dmt.

I have done incountable 5 meo dmt trips, mostly smoked ones but also sublingual and with and without IMAOs. I have had quite a heroic dosages too and apart of the world shattering to pieces intensity of the trip, I would say it was always 100% sure and transparent for the body.


Maybe it´s the bufotenine the potentially dangerous but the 5-meo-dmt seems to me, subjetively, after a hackathon of experiences, utterly benign


Over 5mgs for non experienced  users can be a hellothon of intense, tho. I´ll better test waters at 2-3mgs

i think it varies from person to person. I for example have sleep apena and stop breathing in my sleep sometimes waking up choking so im more careful with any drug that sends out of my body as my airways are more blocked than the regular person. But more experince does make things easier to handle but i only done it a few times.  My heart is also a bit wonky from stimulant abuse. Either way each person has their own body and should proceed with caution if they have any underlying physical conditions.

I am no aware of any 5-MeO-DMT deaths on healthy subjects with the pure molecule itself.


Erowid has two reports of deaths in which MAOIs were involved.


In June, a pretty high-profile death happened in Spain with toad secretions: [https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52920291](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-52920291)

It has not been revealed if any other drugs were involved, but the victim was trying to kick a drug addiction


And that moronic pseudo-shaman who doesn't deserve to be named has 4 deaths under his belt because of malpractice with toad secretions (not pure 5-MeO-DMT). The facts are not clear as he, of course, tried to dodge responsibility, and I think was helped by lenient authorities. Here's some info: [https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/ar...oval-336d9c64266d4cacd07ba92a9d123d454cd32ce4](https://news.knowledia.com/US/en/articles/open-letter-concerning-abuses-by-octavio-rettig-and-gerry-sandoval-336d9c64266d4cacd07ba92a9d123d454cd32ce4)

That article is really shocking I truly hope they didn't do all that stuff and it being exaggerated. Sound like sociopaths though regardless personally I am staying away from anybody who calls themselves a shaman honestly. What is with the throwing water in people's mouth to get gag response? Stuff like that didn't make sense to me obviously a wacky move and is this dude blowing yopo up their nose and having them smoke toad venom at the same time? His whole method of going about this sounds really sketchy. If I was ever gonna do this is would be with synthetic 5-MeO-DMT taken with no other drugs.

A german guy killed himself last year was called tobias he was smoking 5meo dmt upwards of 8 times a day and killed himself during a psychotic break on the trip. Though this is the extreme end of 5 meo dmt use there are others who will end up the same as they smoke it every day

Gotta be a hardcore psychonaut to be smoking 5-MeO-DMT all day everyday, my goodness . Would tolerance not really be that much an issue like with N, N-DMT? Pretty much any ridiculously excessive psychedelic use like that could have consequences I'd assume, people get obsessed with all manners of things. To each their own I'll say.

Tolerance is not a issue at all. Within a hour you can just get keep smoking off and blasting off but why anybody would want to do that when its the most intense experince on earth is beyond me.

I am like half flush this insane shit down the toilet and half I should order a gram of it right now. 


Its such an intense experience. You realize as soon as you exhale that holy shit this is going to be crazy. I vape it in a dedicated 5 meo dmt meth pipe and it despite weighing out precise mg doses there is quite a bit of residue in the pipe from the last load that is active. Its easy to smoke more than you meant to and the smoke is so sweet and tasty. I would avoid using any type of Yocan DMT vape pens because of build up. Every time I do it its like several days of enhanced mood after.

Yeah, you feel the intensity building from 0 to FUCK! just as you release the puff, however the smoke is anything but sweet.

Any i.m. users here? I recently did 10 mg of 5-MeO-DMT i.m. and it was an intense experience. But not really psychedelic?


I had convulsions, a very irregular breathing rate and sweated a lot. I felt like I got what I deserved for taking what is basically toad poison. After 30-ish minutes of lying down I was able to get up, limbs still shaking, and felt great euphoria with slight fleeting OEVs.


Did I not take enough for a "breakthrough" or is it just not for me ? (I'm in no rush to try it again)

There are instructions on how to make a 5meo-dmt vape cart on erowid. 

"dose delivered depends on the pen strength, how long you draw, and to some extent, how hard you draw."


Am I alone in thinking this is an imprecise method?

I will hopefully get a half gram of this finally.

I have done houndreds of different nn-dmt trips before but never 5-meo.


Would it work to make changa from this?

No harmala but just maybe 20% 5-meo and then plain Leaf or maybe caapi Leaf.


Since a full dose is around 15mg then 20% would probably work well.

So around 100mg of 5-meo-changa would be a good strong breakthrough.

fuck do not mix maois with 5 meo or anything.


A full dose can be less than 10 mg of 5 meo.


Start with 4 mg 5 meo and go up 1 mg each time til you find your release dose which could be around 10-12 mg.


Also have a sitter this stuff is ultra powerful. its way way beyond dmt

I second this, [@Bitchniggaz](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/390283/), please don't mix it with an MAOI, it's plenty powerful on its own and doesn't need any potentiation with. It could be dangerous to combo it with an MAOI.

I stated that i would just make it with plain Leaf or maybe some caapi Leaf.

Plain caapi has barely any harmala, to get any kind of maoi you need to make att least 10x caapi.


But thanks for the warning, will def tread with caution.

synthetic 5-meo-dmt fumarate and what about it?


So I am looking to try both DMTs, I have never done those before, and minus the research/trip reports I read on here, I can't seem to find any information on like , which to do first , and should I do synthetics only, or keep looking for a 100% natural product?

I am looking to reach that 'break through' experience, is it possible to obtain such effect if I were to say mix my DMT with a vape ?


I have a few issues. I can't smoke indoors where I live, and don't live in a area where I can just light up on my porch, and really don't want to 'drive just to try'.


Which should I try first? DMT or 5meo? and without a trip-sitter would it be suggest I like maybe phone a friend before hand and facetime them?

I'd say DMT first.  Drive to a secluded place and do it.  If you have a buddy with you to trip sit that would be good, my bass player blasted off the first time and had a freak out for the first half and I had to guide him (it was cute, he clung to me and said I was his rock and buried his face in my shoulder).  Brought him inside away from the music and talking him through it and he came out absolutely glowing.  DMT is insanely powerful, you can't really prepare, it's something totally different.


5-MeO-DMT is different.  Probably DMT is a good first step.

does it matter if the DMT is in a fumarate state? I hear its a bit different  then freebase? 5,meo I can digg . i have no one really irl that i can take with me. but im in no rush.

now synthetic 5meo is just as good if not better then the toad venom correct?

5meo is pretty much identical but way more potent than toad venom.


If starting with 5meo DMT start very low like 3-4 mg and work your way up to the breakthrough. DMT is easier to go without a trip sitter. 5meo can be done without a sitter but highly advised not to. Some people can have been seen purging and puking hard which by having some one there helped them. but every reaction is different.


Each will be life changing. But 5meo dmt moreso.

It's the same thing but you can't smoke it. Also it's a bit weaker by weight, but the effects are identical, it's the same drug afterall.


Where the hell can you even get DMT fumarate? All illicit DMT is either freebase or rarely, HCl

Any advice on converting the fumarate to freebase? I was thinking of just disolving it in H20, adding base and collecting the precipitate. Looking at methods for other tryptamine fumarates its seems people are collecting the precipitate in a polar solvent and then evaporating, which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

I bought a gram of this and now its sold out, as it was only for sale in Canada pretty sure the people who make those insanely expensive carts bought it all. The 5-meo community is worse than ayahuasca yuppies, both for over commercialization and falling for fake shamans. I'm sorry it's a 10 minute experience, I wouldn't pay hundreds of dollars for it, the "ceremony" was made up in the last 20 years, and i think the idea you need "integration" is just silly. I can see it with DMT or other psychedelics, maybe, but there isn't even any head fuckery. Its a 10 minute white out there is nothing to integrate. People in online 5 communities get made when i say i just use their "sacred medicine" to jerk off. I wish they would stop calling it medicine because it gives my countries health authority ammunition to ban it. All its going to take in canada is one public bad event, a death or whatever, and the party is over. Giving this over to one of these fruitake toad cults, like how peyote is legal for native church or aya for the santo daime church, that would be the worst thing possible for this substance IMO. It does have anti depressent effects for me, i'm kind of worried that big pharma will take control of it too. I just keep thinking this has to be the end of the road, its banned in so many places, Canada will follow suit eventually....

Glad you snagged 1g of it [@Viraldrome](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/503341/). I agree with a lot of what you're saying here. I'd use more diplomatic words to describe my sentiments, but I do admire your fire ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


I reckon there could easily be a lot of people out there like you who wanted to acquire a little stash, and that could explain it selling out quickly. But for sure the commercialization of the experience is a concern for me as well. I hope the supply keeps pumping back in.


One opinion I differ with you on is that think integration can be pretty important with 5-MeO-DMT, but that can be a very personal process. I know for myself it really rocked my world, in a good way. It wasn't really something I wanted to talk to anyone too much about, but I can see how some personalities might need others around them to help process. I guess that's one thing that I love about this community's existence and the general attitude on here, people can reach out and aren't patronized or told they did it wrong etc.


I really really dislike the culture of people thinking they have to put them self at the feet of a self proclaimed guru, or be in some kind sacred cult of self-important spiritual people. Maybe some people actually do need that, I dunno. They probably do. I just wish there was more of a message of independence and DIY punk attitude out there. I feel like everyone is getting this idea that they need their hand held when they take psychedelics, which is good for businesses and life-coach type people, but counter to real liberation in my view.


I like the motto "Keep psychedelics wild"


Luckily there always will be an element of that. At the very least, you can't fence in mushroom spores.

Sorry when i re read that now it comes off as a rant. i'm not anti spirituality, just that there is no religious lineage with this so all the rituals are made up and you could save the 500 bucks by DIY. 


I just saw some kid say it was going to be their first psychedelic experience, which is insane. I've been tripping for thirty years and spent decades reading about 5 and researching it before I tried it. I can't even fathom it being someone's 1st trip. But I also don't roll around screaming on the ground like those youtube videos either. I see people say they are embarrassed by how they acted, i got past the acting silly or feeling bad about it after if you do hang ups many years ago. This is just so not a beginners drug

 but i'm guessing there might be forums out there where ppl trade ethnobotanicals? is it going too far to ask for any recommendations on good forums to join?

The first place you should go is DMT Nexus and look into the extraction tek, last i heard there was no way to remove toxic gramine from the mix. Make sure you know what you are doing

Could be gramine has a lot lower solubility in naphtha, never tried it but some anecdotal reports suggest this and it should be more polar with one carbon less

tbh, i dunno if i'm up for trying it (my days of tripping are at least on major hiatus), but i think it'd be fun to have an ethnobotanical garden someday.


with that said, casual perusal of the nexus tells me freebase gramine is pretty insoluble in nonpolar solvents, whereas freebase 5-meo-nn-dmt (i know, i'm a smartass) ought to be pretty soluble in np... should be a pretty straightforward a/b separation, no?

What is the starting dose for a semi-advanced psychonaut? The most I did was 500ug LSD but usually I stick to 300ug level of strong recreational where teh ego gets dissipated for half an hour at most. This one is so intruguing and tempting but I'm also a little scared, everyone says it is so powerful. btw I don't believe in asphyxiations stories, taking less than 50mg of 5 -meo should never be lethal, these are just some myths.


But anyway, should I really start at 5mg and go up or just throw myself at 10-15? I really don't like the bodyload when thepayoff is not worth it. So if I  white out after 12mg on  my first atempt Ill just go down or nay? It's tricky but fascinating nonetheless.

The right dose depends on how much prep you had leading up to experience IMO. Like are you going to meditate intensely beforehand, or do you want something (for lack of a better term) more casual? I had the full 15-20 mg my first time. It was very challenging and kind of negative but healing long-term. It was what I needed, and I didn't freak out or need to call for help. It feels a lot like DMT if you've had experience with it. Just quiet. Very quiet. Also, I haven't personally experienced painful body-load so it varies from person to person (but apparently can be pretty bad). Lower doses aren't as bad for me as some people describe them. To me, if I meditate through the experience, it feels very quiet and borderline peaceful.


TLDR: if you are doing it for the experience, go the whole distance, but take it seriously. IMO

Ya know, IME the DMTs aren't actually super soluble in NPs, and that is why they make the best crystallization solvents. They do seem very soluble in alcohols however.

Um no this is actually not true, there is at least 1 well known case of exactly this happening, and the decedent was my close friends roommate.


##### Death of Anthony Birkholzedit​
On January 17, 2017, in [Jackson Hole](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole), [Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming), after drinking heavily, Hardison and two other men consumed a substance believed by the [Teton County, Wyoming](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton_County,_Wyoming) coroner to be the psychedelic drug [5-MeO-DMT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT).[[13]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_William_Hardison#cite_note-Buckrail05-18-2010-13) One of the men, artist and filmmaker Anthony Birkholz,[[14]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_William_Hardison#cite_note-MemorialCash-14) died from aspiration of [vomitus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting) secondary to food, alcohol and 5-MeO-DMT ingestion. The jury at the coroner's inquest found that Birkholz's death was accidental but could have been prevented.[[13]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_William_Hardison#cite_note-Buckrail05-18-2010-13)[[15]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_William_Hardison#cite_note-GlossedOver-15) Hardison called [5-MeO-DMT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) "a very rare, beautiful experience," but admitted he hadn't done any since the night Birkholz died. "Looking back now," he said, "I'm not so charmed."[[16]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_William_Hardison#cite_note-Inquest-16)

I would generally recommend starting slow because everyone reacts differently. I've seen people scream at the top of their lungs, roll around puking, try to have sex w me, etc. It can be a very intense and profound experience. That said i do probably find more benefit in the larger doses. Ive had a few breakthroughs, but i think the white out experience is kinda pointless. Side note, 5 meo dmt, mixes really well with DMT itself.

[@Didgital](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/496462/) 


is there a continuum where the dmt and the 5-meo-dmt would take over the... focus of the experience? or do they just blend no matter how much of each is taken? 


(anyway i still have yet to try 5-meo-dmt, still scares completely shitless to even think of finding it... dmt is insane enough)

They blend almost seamlessly tho 5 meo lingers longer. The dmt is just there to add color the 5 is dominant

I finally tried it during holiday break one month ago, then repeated the experience a week later. Both times it was a 5 hour session of 3 times 15-25mg insufflated. I felt fantastic both during the trip and for the following weeks - no screaming or puking, generally little to no bodyload. I haven't reached a full breakthrough and nondualism though, but this substance is the shit like no other.


In terms of the trip itself - fairly non visual, there is subtle melting and tracing, but it's so perfectly fast you almost feel like observing quantum fields, no strong hallucinations though. Everything is brighter, gleaming white and gold filter on reality. Headspace is the name of the game. You don't listen to the music - you are the music and it flows through your body like current. Strong ego dissolution and ego death, though it felt like blinking in and out, I was able to distinguish myself and the world, but only partially. Then there is full body orgasm, which completes the package - every inch of your body feels love and caring. I haven't experience OOBE or floating but gravity was a bitch - impossible to stay vertical during peak, just lay in bed and relax or you can get hurt.


And for the most important part - the afterglow. First week was like dancing on ungodly amounts of sertraline (but miles better). I felt changed: full of empathy, self criticism, emotions, humility. Smiling and being honest at the same time. Nothing else changed in my life during that period. Tbh last years and months had been pretty harsh, so I could tell the substance doing some magicks there. After three weeks it has faded a little, I see bad habits returning, and the ego reestablishing itself in ways I sometimes don't want (funny example is how I reduced how much I swear, drastically, but lately I feel more nervous and short fused). What can I say, it's time to take 5meo again, this weekend or next. I'm still scared of its power, but the healing effect is sop insane, this substance being illegal is a crime itself.

Pretty big difference in color in my latest 5 purchase, its like fluffy white all the other times its been tan brown. Tastes the same, seems equally potent from the mini test i did.

how about mixing and microdosing of 5meo? obv small amounts snuffed, but can anyone share their experience? I hope it's not a taboo, I mean it's a textbook god molecule in proper doses (over 25-30mg insufflated in my case), but otherwise it's just a fun time listening to music and doing stuff

[@acidtrip666](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/581056/) there aren't a lot of taboos around here

I've taken threshold doses of 5-MeO-DMT prefer using it at the low (8mg) to high dose (22mg) range. For threshold (5mg) and lower, I don't think is the fit for this substance, personally. But I encourage you to test it out for yourself and report.

Those numbers are for my own case, also insufflated. Threshold, low, high dosages will vary for everyone of course.

[@perpetualdawn](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/307995/) I had simillar experience - a very small dose of 5mg kinda works like a mild music enhancer, but only once in the evening, then I need to take more (around 10-15mg which is still in the "recreational" range). Doses over 20mg are definitely spiritual and deep at least for me - in such cases a good set and setting is required.


Lately I did a little experiment and tried taking 5meo for three days straight - eyeballing doses of 5-15mg with tweezers, drinking beers and chilling. First two days were pretty fun but the last day I got clearly worn out and felt a little bad doing it, so I'm gonna take a longer break and next time aim at my tested session of 15-20-25 splits, which are more profound and leave a longer afterglow.

Anyone tried storing this for any significant length of time? I've got a little vial of what I believe is the oxalate salt that I've been sitting on for about three years. Yet to try but I've a free weekend coming up so thought I might sniff a teeny bump or few and see what happens.

I had some that was far older than that and still active, though it’s turned a tan color. Not sure what kind of salt it was. Finished 10 years after purchase. It wasn’t freebase though. I’m always surprised by how long tryptamines stay stable when properly stored.
