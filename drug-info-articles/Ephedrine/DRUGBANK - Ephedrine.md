## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as phenylpropanes. These are organic compounds containing a phenylpropane moiety.

### Background

Ephedrine was first described in western literature in 1888, as a naturally occurring component of the ephedra plant, along with
pseudoephedrine
.
5
Ephedrine acts as both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic. It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles.
4
,
8
Ephedrine is used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects.
8
Ephedrine and
phenylephrine
are still used to treat hypotension, but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.
6
,
7
,
9
Ephedrine was granted a type 7 FDA Approval on 29 April 2016.
9

### Indication

Ephedrine intravenous injections are indicated to treat hypotension under anesthesia,
8
,
13
ephedrine injections by multiple routes are indicated to treat allergic conditions such as bronchial asthma,
12
ephedrine nasal spray is and OTC medication used as a decongestant.
11

### Pharmacodynamics

Ephedrine increases blood pressure by stimulating heart rate and cardiac output and variably increasing peripheral resistance.
9
It causes bronchodilation due to the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in the lungs. By stimulating alpha-adrenergic receptors in bladder smooth muscle cells, ephedrine also increases the resistance to the outflow of urine.
8
,
9
The therapeutic window of ephedrine is wide, as patients can be given doses of 5mg up to 50mg.
11
Patients should be counselled regarding the pressor effects of sympathomimetic amines and the risk of tachyphylaxis.
4
Also, the use of ephedrine for hypotension prophylaxis is associated with a higher risk of hypertension, compared to when ephedrine is used to treat hypotension.

### Absorption

Oral ephedrine reaches an average C
max
of 79.5ng/mL, with a T
max
of 1.81h, and a bioavailability of 88%.
2

### Metabolism

Ephedrine is largely unmetabolized in the body.
1
Ephedrine can be N-demethylated to norephedrine, or demethylated and deaminized to benzoic acid conjugates and 1,2-hydroxypropylbenzene.

### Half-life

Oral ephedrine has a plasma elimination half life of approximately 6 hours, but there is a large degree of inter-patient variability.

### Toxicity

Patients experiencing an overdose of ephedrine will present with rapidly increasing blood pressure.
8
,
13
Manage overdose with blood pressure monitoring, and possibly the administration of parenteral antihypertensives.
8
,
13
The LD
50
in mice after oral administration is 785mg/kg, after intraperitoneal administration if 248mg/kg, and after subcutaneous administration is 425mg/kg.

### Mechanism of action

Ephedrine is a direct and indirect sympathomimetic amine.
4
As a direct effect, ephedrine activates alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. As an indirect effect, it inhibits norepinephrine reuptake and increases the release of norepinephrine from vesicles in nerve cells.
4
These actions combined lead to larger quantities of norepinephrine present in the synapse for more extended periods of time, increasing stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system.
4
Ephedrine acts as an agonist of alpha-1, beta-1 and beta-2-adrenergic receptors. The stimulation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors causes the constriction of veins and a rise in blood pressure, the stimulation of beta-1-adrenergic receptors increases cardiac chronotropy and inotropy, and the stimulation of beta-2-adrenergic receptors causes vasodilation and bronchodilation.

### General Function

Electrogenic antiporter that exchanges one cationic monoamine with two intravesicular protons across the membrane of secretory and synaptic vesicles. Uses the electrochemical proton gradient established by the V-type proton-pump ATPase to accumulate high concentrations of monoamines inside the vesicles prior to their release via exocytosis. Transports a variety of catecholamines such as dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline, histamine, and indolamines such as serotonin (PubMed:23363473, PubMed:37914936, PubMed:38081299, PubMed:38517752, PubMed:8643547). Regulates the transvesicular monoaminergic gradient that determines the quantal size. Mediates somatodendritic dopamine release in hippocampal neurons, likely as part of a regulated secretory pathway that integrates retrograde synaptic signals (By similarity). Acts as a primary transporter for striatal dopamine loading ensuring impulse-dependent release of dopamine at the synaptic cleft (By similarity). Responsible for histamine and serotonin storage and subsequent corelease from mast cell granules (PubMed:8860238)
