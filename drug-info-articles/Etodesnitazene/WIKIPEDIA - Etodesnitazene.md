Etodesnitazene (also known as desnitroetonitazene, etazen, etazene, and etazone) is a benzimidazole-derived opioid analgesic drug, which was originally developed in the late 1950s alongside etonitazene and a range of related derivatives. It is many times less potent than etonitazene itself, but still 70 times more potent than morphine in animal studies. Corresponding analogues where the N,N-diethyl group is replaced by piperidine or pyrrolidine rings also retain significant activity (10 times and 20 times morphine, respectively). Etodesnitazene has been sold as a designer drug, first being identified in both Poland and Finland in March 2020.
