## Subjective Experience

I had sampled skullcap a couple of years previously, but my notes were sparse. On
the adapted Shulgin scale they indicated a + when drank as a tea, and a +* when
smoked. Translating this, I felt a very minor effect, possibly too minor to articulate,
but enjoyed slightly more potency when I smoked it.

This was contrary to most Internet reports, which claimed greater effect from tea
than smoking. Regardless, I decided to re-test by smoking, as on the evening in
question I had a full stomach, which could have reduced the efficacy of oral
ingestion.

As I wasn’t feeling at the top of my game, I was hoping for some sort of mood lift, or
less optimistically, for an anxiolytic response. My expectations, however, were not at
all high.

```
T+0:00 Filling the bowl of a small bong, I take five large hits, in fairly quick
succession. [7pm]
```

```
None of the hits are terrible in terms of taste, although they are perhaps
slightly harsh. On the first hit, I feel a slight and momentary head rush.
Thereafter, I don’t feel any obvious response or any immediate form of
intoxication.
```
```
T+0:03 Sitting down at my desk, perhaps I do feel slightly better. The stomach
anxiety has diminished, and there is a slight fuzziness there or thereabouts.
```
```
I am not stoned, but I do feel a mild but marked reaction. There is nothing
unpleasant about it, but it isn’t a high or any form of euphoria. It is simply a
more chilled heady feeling and accompanying state of mind.
```
```
T+0:10 Ten minutes in, these effects are still with me. I feel a gentle calmness,
relative to where I was beforehand. There is a distinct headiness about this
which is quite soothing.
```
```
T+0:20 I am still relaxed. Throughout I have retained mental clarity, and at
no stage have I felt that my functionality has been impaired. It is a solid and
reasonably interesting experience.
```
```
T+0:30 The ride is starting to subside a little, although I am still calm and
chillaxed.
```
```
T+1:00 The effects are now less pronounced, and I am close to base, but
certainly not at base. It strikes me that I could have been more deeply sedated
earlier than I thought I was.
```
```
T+3:00 Most of the headiness has gone. I feel more or less back at baseline,
although anxiety is still absent and I still feel calm in a naturally sedated way.
I am wondering if there will be a knock-on effect for the night’s sleep.
```
The night’s sleep was a little strange. There were weird dreams, which could be
unconnected, but the sleep tended to have the same skullcap headiness quality to it,
and this was definitely there when I awoke in the morning. There was no discomfort
but it was present and it only dissipated after an hour or so, with the help of a cup of
filtered coffee.

Following this experiment, I am now left wondering about skullcap consumed as tea.
Given that smoking touched a fairly pleasant ++ experience, this may well be worth
another fling.

I should also state that the skullcap I used was very dry, and had been lying around
for some time. This suggests that fresh skullcap might produce an even stronger ride.
Bear in mind here that with a higher quality sample five bong hits may well be
overdoing it.

Finally, it is worth noting that a number of species of scutellaria are cited as being
psychoactive. Of these, scutellaria nana is sometimes claimed to be the most potent,
although it may be difficult to procure.
