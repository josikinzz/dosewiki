**Tianeptine** (trade names **Stablon** and **Coaxil** ) is an atypical [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) . While primarily a prescription drug, it is sometimes used in high doses for recreational [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) effects. It has a unique and poorly-understood mechanism of action consisting of modulation of the brain's monoaminergic and glutamatergic systems.

While tianeptine is classified as a [tricyclic antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tricyclic_antidepressant) (TCA), its pharmacological effects differ from those of typical antidepressants. This is primarily due to the fact that it is not thought to act immediately through the regulation of monoaminergic [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) (such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , or [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) .) Rather, it is theorized to act upon [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and glutamatergic mechanisms, causing the brain to adapt more readily to stress and [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) . Clinical trials of tianeptine suggest that it is just as effective as other, more popular antidepressants such as fluoxetine (i.e., SSRI) and amitriptyline (i.e., TCA). However, tianeptine seems to exhibit fewer side effects and complications than traditional antidepressants.

In addition to its antidepressant effects, tianeptine also exhibits [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) (anti-anxiety) properties, specifically having shown promise in the treatment of panic disorders. Tianeptine also displays neuroprotective properties and has been shown to improve cognition in patients with depression. Tianeptine's anxiolytic and mood-boosting effects, in addition to its purposed neuroprotective and cognitive benefits, make it a popular [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) .

Subjective effects of recreational doses include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and/or [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Prescription guidelines indicate that tianeptine should be taken in 12.5 mg doses and taken three times daily, waiting 3-4 hours between doses. However, doses of 12-35 mg are more commonly used by recreational users.

It is worth noting that very little is known about the potential toxicity of recreational tianeptine use. Some users have reported that its [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) effects can cause both physical and psychological dependence like traditional [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) (e.g. [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) , [morphine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Morphine) , [hydrocodone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hydrocodone) ). It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

Tianeptine is a tricyclic antidepressant, as its molecular structure is composed of three cyclic compounds. Despite tianeptine's chemical similarity to other TCAs, its effects and [mechanisms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scientific_information#Pharmacology) are unique.

### Sodium and sulfate salts

Like many drugs, tianeptine can be manufactured into various salt forms to achieve maximum bioavailability, absorption, and overall effectiveness. Tianeptine is most commonly found in its sodium salt form because it is the only version that is sold by pharmacies and prescribed by doctors. However, the sulfate salt is now also being marketed on [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) vendor sites, suggested as being superior to the sodium salt, especially with respect to having a longer half-life and duration.

There is no formal research to suggest any increased efficacy of the sulfate form, but anecdotal reports from users suggest that it may be more effective and have a longer duration than the sodium salt. The sulfate form is not more potent, but it is metabolized slower by the body, thus making a single dose per day more effective. Anecdotal reports by users of both salt forms indicate that because the sulfate is metabolized more slowly, there is less potential for addiction. The sulfate form appears to provide a more level experience as opposed to the sodium form, which reaches its peak antidepressant effect more quickly and returns back to baseline more suddenly.

## Pharmacology

Unlike most prescribed antidepressants, tianeptine appears to have negligible direct effects on monoamines like dopamine and serotonin. Tianeptine slightly increases extracellular levels of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , although it is not known how exactly it causes this release.

Experiments conducted on rats revealed that tianeptine does not increase levels of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) in subjects. Rather, it has been found to increase the *reuptake* of serotonin, being labeled a selective serotonin reuptake *enhancer* . This lies in contrast to the most popularly prescribed antidepressants, which are selective [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [reuptake inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (SSRIs). However, tianeptine's alteration of serotonin is likely not relevant to its mechanism.

Tianeptine also contributes to a significant increase in neuroplasticity through the modulation of [glutamate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and its receptors, most notably through the indirect modulation of NMDA receptors. Such increases in brain plasticity have been linked to a significant reduction of stress and depression symptoms. More recent studies have concluded that tianeptine is also an effective [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid#Mu_.28.CE.BC.29) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) , which could contribute to its antidepressant and [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) properties.

It is also sometimes used to treat irritable bowel syndrome or asthma.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)**
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - More pronounced feelings of euphoria have been reported at doses near or above 100 mg. These feelings are extremely similar to that of a typical [opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioid) .
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)** - Tianeptine increases the reuptake of serotonin, which has been found to combat bronchoconstriction.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational tianeptine use have not been studied in any scientific context, and the exact toxic dosage is unknown.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) of tianeptine has not yet officially been established; however, it seems to have a large therapeutic index and margin of safety. In 2007, a 26-year-old man committed suicide by taking an excessive amount of tianeptine in combination with alcohol. However, the amount required to overdose is not likely to be taken on accident. To ensure safety while using tianeptine, it is advised to not exceed 100 mg in a single dose or 300 mg total in one day.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

The chronic use of tianeptine can be considered as mildly addictive and is capable of causing both physical and psychological dependence. When physical dependence has developed, [withdrawal symptoms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids#Discontinuation) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of tianeptine develops with prolonged use, including therapeutic effects. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). This compound may share a cross tolerance with other [trycyclic antidepressants](/w/index.php?title=Trycyclic_antidepressants&action=edit&redlink=1) and [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is worth noting that because of tianeptine's short duration of effects, it may compel some to frequent redosing. The potential euphoric effects of high doses (> 100 mg) may cause some users to exceed recommended dosages, which could quickly raise tolerance and intensify negative side effects. In addition, tianeptine possesses certain properties as a [μ-opioid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%9C-opioid) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) , possibly leading to addiction and withdrawal mechanics similar to that of [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiate) . However, as with most people looking to discontinue their antidepressant medications (both [SSRIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/SSRI) and [TCAs](/w/index.php?title=TCA&action=edit&redlink=1) ), daily users of tianeptine should [taper](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Taper) off their usage instead of suddenly halting it. This will ensure that negative discontinuation symptoms are kept to a minimum.

Tianeptine withdrawal can occur with as little as ~500mg per day, and increases in severity with the amount of daily dosage and time spent using the drug. Withdrawal symptoms are similar to opioids (flu-like symptoms, watery eyes, and nose, dry heaves et al.) and may include emotional instability. Due to the fact that Tianeptine generally has weaker recreational properties compared to other opioids, the withdrawal of this substance can feel significantly worse than an equally euphoric dose of a more traditional opioid.

## Legal status

Tianeptine is available by prescription in many European, Asian, and South American countries and distributed under brand names such as Stablon and Coaxil.

- **Canada:** Tianeptine is uncontrolled in Canada, meaning it is legal to possess without any sort of license or prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany:** Tianeptine is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **Russia:** In Russia, since 2010, tianeptine is a Schedule III controlled substance.
- **Sweden** : Tianeptine is not an approved prescription medicine, and is therefore a controlled substance.
- **Switzerland** : Tianeptine is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **Turkey** : Tianeptine is a 'green prescription' only substance and illegal when sold or possessed without a prescription.
- **United Kingdom:** Tianeptine is illegal to produce, supply, or import under the Psychoactive Substance Act, which came into effect on May 26th, 2016.
- **United States:** Tianeptine is currently a federally uncontrolled substance in the United States. However, many nootropics vendors have ceased carrying it due to its recreational use and abuse potential. In March of 2018, the Michigan state legislature passed a bill to classify tianeptine sodium salt as a Schedule II controlled substance, making it the first state to schedule the drug.
