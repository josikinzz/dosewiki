Just found this in erowid a few minutes ago and wonder what the rest of BL thinks of it. I have been waiting a long time for this to pop up![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

thoughts?

comments?

Sad that's the only report on Erowid about the substance... It's pretty thin and not the most helpful thing in the world. Then again when one has tried enough psychedelics to be springing for an oddball like 4-AcO-DALT, it might be hard to pick out what is truly unique about the oddball.


4-Substituted tryptamines tend to perform well. This one is so under-studied, though, that it's tough to tell what to expect. The molecular structure of DALT looks similar to DPT...

very uncommon substance - [one report on erowid](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=66631) was all I could find. anyone knows anything about it here?

This bit renders that report pretty useless IMO:


"tapped out about 35 mg"


translates as:  "I have no fucking clue how much of this stuff I took."

I've smoked it and taken it orally.  Orally didn't do much for me.  Smoked is quite brief, but enjoyable, although not at all intense.  It just feels like a mild body orgasm type feeling with fish bowl like visuals.  This stuff is nothing mind blowing.  Still, it was fun for a Saturday afternoon...

4-Phosphoryloxy derivatives are more stable (the blue colour from brusing psilocybin containing fungi is due to breakdown of the psilocin present, not the psilocybin)

I'm not sure I understand your question wilow, but psilocybe mushrooms contain both 4-ho-dmt and 4-phosphoryloxy-dmt, if that's what you are asking.

Are you sure you're not thinking about 5-meo-DALT? Your description sounds on par with my oral experiences of 5-meo-DALT. Speaking of, you've just provided the impetus for me to try smoking the rest I have. I've heard the visuals from that smoked are very fish-bowl like. Nanobrain has some comical descriptions of the trip that anybody interested should search for and read, he's great at cryptically describing tryptamines ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Actually 4-AcO-DET is highly active when smoked.  15mg or so was plenty for a +3 of a brief duration.  No instant peak, took about 10 minutes to fully hit.  Nice, but nothing too deep....much prefer it orally.

Yes I know somebody planning to do some vaporization trials with some 4-ho-dmt sometime in the future. And possibly IV although he hasn't decided that.

hey FB, is that just for 4-HO's or is that for most tryptamines (the possibility for oxidation when smoking it).


I notice I get a thick paste in my mouth when I smoke a lot of 5-meo-DMT (sometimes I'll 'bump' like 3-4mg every few minutes to get into a drawn out 5-meo-dmt ayahuasca trip like state). Is that paste a byproduct of the combustive process?

its sort of impure, they are light tan crystals, but I smoke a lot of it when I do trip on it. I like repeatedly hitting the pipe. I remember this happening with DPT freebase, but I think there was some extra sodium bicarbonate in the mix (which probably accounted for a lot of the pastey stuff).


Except last time I hit a lot all at once and had the breakthrough I haven't had on it in awhile. I died ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

You will likely not find any info on this. As far as I have known, this compound never existed before today. 


If you happen to have some and want to try it, then I recommend starting at microgram doses and working your way up in tiny increments.


ps. Such a molecule is starting to get too big. I wonder if it retains psychedelic activity at all?

it will be more similar to psilocin than 5-meo-DALT that you can be almost certain of (just like 5-meo-DALT will be more like 5-meo-DiPT than 4-aco-DALT).

I would guess it will be like a very mild and smooth psilocin-like trip with little to no ego loss.

even 100mg+ (orally) of this material produce only a +2. some mental sharpness, then some wooziness as if drunk, and sleepiness, along with a few telltale tryptamine physical sensations and some emotional release.

I tried, if what I got wasn't mislabelled. First trial a friend and I did about 35mg oral each and we got very sleepy... then tried to vapourise some on top of that, but as the bitter white powder is in HCl form, it's not really vapourisable... next time I ate 50mg, adding 50 more a bit later...  again, not so many effects except for what I stated above. A third trial had me ingest 114mg all at once... with few effects, even though there should have been but little tolerance as the last tryptamine ingestion had been 4 days prior. When I say it was +2, I mean that I did get some physical "oops I am coming up" feelings along with mild peripheral visuals and colour enhancement ... like having eaten a very low dose of shrooms -threshold I suppose. With emotional release I meant that I actually started crying like I hadn't in a long time. I've been depressed a fair bit lately and often find it hard to release the feelings, i.e. I don't cry but just stare into space. Somehow, with the 4-AcO-DALT the tears were released and I could dwell in the depression quite comfortably, releasing much of it. Perhaps this wouldn't have been the case if it had been stronger as my ego might have acted up rather than taken the gentle hint and let go...and maybe it's just the fact that this drug seems unable to produce anything but a +2...  sorry, it's really not worth more than a "half-assed" trip report - maybe because the experience itself is somewhat half-assed... twice I added a few mg of 4-AcO-MIPT later just to get more out of it... even a lowish dose of that seemed not very active when added, likely due to tolerance... but any effects that might have yielded would say next to nothing about the nature of 4-AcO-DALT anyway. So, sorry, no extended report.


EDIT. I had heard rumours of it being somewhat empathogenic...  upon thinking this over, I must say that it might well be in the sense that it is relaxing and seems to subtly open emotional channels. Hence my release as well I suppose. But it is not an empathogen along the lines of the more classic ones like MDMA or M1 and the like.

weird, well it sounds more in line with what 5-meo-DALT is like. Do you have any left over that you could marquis test? The 5-meo version should turn blackish and the 4-aco version should....I dunno actually, green maybe??? (I'm not sure if its the aco that reacts with the marquis like it is the 5-meo, ie all 5-meo compounds turn black with marquis).


anyways, thanks for the report ximot...sounds like a strange experience...but hopefully one that you needed?


take care friend, peace and hugs to you ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

First trial a friend and I did about 35mg oral each and we got very sleepy... then tried to vapourise some on top of that, but as the bitter white powder is in HCl form, it's not really vapourisable... next time I ate 50mg, adding 50 more a bit later...  again, not so many effects except for what I stated above. A third trial had me ingest 114mg all at once... with few effects, even though there should have been but little tolerance as the last tryptamine ingestion had been 4 days prior. When I say it was +2, I mean that I did get some physical "oops I am coming up" feelings along with mild peripheral visuals and colour enhancement ... like having eaten a very low dose of shrooms -threshold I suppose. With emotional release I meant that I actually started crying like I hadn't in a long time. I've been depressed a fair bit lately and often find it hard to release the feelings, i.e. I don't cry but just stare into space. Somehow, with the 4-AcO-DALT the tears were released and I could dwell in the depression quite comfortably, releasing much of it. Perhaps this wouldn't have been the case if it had been stronger as my ego might have acted up rather than taken the gentle hint and let go...and maybe it's just the fact that this drug seems unable to produce anything but a +2...  sorry, it's really not worth more than a "half-assed" trip report - maybe because the experience itself is somewhat half-assed... twice I added a few mg of 4-AcO-MIPT later just to get more out of it... even a lowish dose of that seemed not very active when added, likely due to tolerance... but any effects that might have yielded would say next to nothing about the nature of 4-AcO-DALT anyway. So, sorry, no extended report.

I had heard rumours of it being somewhat empathogenic...  upon thinking this over, I must say that it might well be in the sense that it is relaxing and seems to subtly open emotional channels. Hence my release as well I suppose. But it is not an empathogen along the lines of the more classic ones like MDMA or M1 and the like.

hmmm this report goes against everything else i read on the DALTs even dosewise. I ws going to try some in europe but now doubt full.

what doses to effects ratio did u find?

u seem like a bit of a hard head compared to other forum reports

what about 5me0-DALT?

isn;t there different forms like HCl, acetate, etc.??

So anyone write a trip report yet or do i have to? mine will be in excess most likely. read all the erowid report and info i could find on the net.

It seems the 5me0-DALT is better.

Could this be smokable in other forms? like a base or acetate etc?

Well who'd have thunk it - a passing Drug Fairy went and dropped a lil bit of this in my lap this very morning. Fortunately fairies are canny folk (albeit somewhat fey too) so said bewinged one had popped it in a labelled baggie so I didn't have to play guess the chem that landed in me lap.


I think I can be pretty sure that it is indeed 4-AcO-DALT but there seems to be precious little info on it so far. It is made up of bright white, very fine crystals - very small crystals but not powder. I'd like to make the most of it ideally cos I don't have a huge amount and have no clue about dosage or effects really other than the Erowid report linkied in this thread... which doesn't exactly seem to be 100% reliable as far as dose goes so am taking it with a pinch of salt and a waft of male cow kaka for now.


Anybody got any more info on this one in the 18 months since this was last mentioned? Anything that may give a hint at dose, duration, effects, most suitable ROA, etc would be just spiffy ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


PS: It's the fumerate that I have if that makes much of a difference to anything.

how much material do you have to work with?


You dont have to answer, but if its enough for multiple trials i would just work your way up.


Ximots report on the last page claimed 100mg brought him to a ++.


id go about it something like this:

trip 1: 1-5mg

trip 2: 10-15mg

trip: 20-30mg

etc


dont go eating 100mg to start shambles.

A certain somebody who knows a thing or two about such thing suspects 10mg would be an active dose and to start lower (which I will be doing anyway, obviously). Have a feeling that the reports in this thread may actually be of 5-MeO-DALT or even something else entirely. Or maybe not... but I hope so cos if 100mg will only produce a ++ then my 70mg that is supposed to be good for a coupla proper trips plus initial titration may turn out to be a bit of a damp squib :D

that sounds inline with all the other 4 ho/aco trypts ive tried (dmt, det, dipt, mipt).

But also their 5 meo counterparts were all active at a low dosage (10mg or less) where as 5 meo dalt requires quite a bit more.


But perhpas their is no relation in dosing btwn 5 meo dalt and 4 aco dalt. It certainly wouldnt surprise me.


Anyway, let us know how it goes.


The 4 aco trypts have been some of the smoothest, crispest and most fun trips ive had.

Any updates Shambles?


I'm wondering if the reports in here are of 5-MeO-DALT, but it wouldn't surprise me if 4-AcO-DALT isn't active until higher doses.

I bought 100mg and found it uninteresting, at least at the dosages I took. I never excdeeded 35mg which only produced threshold effects, maybe I was just underdosing. Still have 40mg or so floating about somewhere.

^ Was told the dosage should be way lower than that. Single digit/low double digit was what I was told but only a handful of folks have tried it so far, as far as I know, so data is limited. What ROA did you use? Definitely 4-AcO-DALT rather than 5-AcO-DALT? Was told the former is way more potent and interesting than the latter.


LSD: Not had a chance to try it yet cos I've been on tramadol and don't fancy mixing it given tram's notorious dodginess for interactions. Tapered off it just recently so will be able to test it soon.

Oral but I may have had something of a tolerancde at the time, was using 4-ho-mipt and 4-aco-dmt quite regularly. Was definetely 4-aco-DALT, I've never seen 5-aco-DALT offered. Maybe I'll give it another chance when my tolerance is low.

20-something, male, 65kg/175cm, used mixture: 35mg of 4-AcO-DALT and a hint of citric acid, dissolved in saline solution. Set & Setting: Alone in a studio with some low lights and soft trance music. Interested in the substance, emotionally a bit shaken, but well, physically healthy. 


(with ~15-20mg IV) The effects are very close to mushrooms, but it's like somebody pushed fast forward - while I was still injecting, the world already washed away in a blurry wave of color and light, hence the inaccurate dosage report. Reached ++ instantly, then went up to +++ for a few minutes. Everything was over within less than an hour but there's a distinct 'shroomy' feeling from start to finish - I could swear I even had the taste in my mouth. Felt very primitive and animalistic for a while, but no mushroom-like 'earth connection'. Wandered through the hallways, everything appeared like a futuristic ruin/dungeon setting, and I had a strong urge to rip my clothes off, throw stuff around and stare into a fire. Resisted said urges.  This was the first time I iv'd a tryptamine, so maybe that high-speed effect came from the ROA rather than the substance itself - I really should read up on this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks! Unfortunately, I only had a small amount, and used it up with the two injections. Based on what I have read and heard, oral dosing should be unproblematic, but I cannot personally verify that. If I happen to run into another batch, I will try nasal and oral next.

Still have a small sample here waiting to be sampled. Started a Small & So Far Insignificant thread on this one (or maybe that was another one?) a while back but have had to put off sampling till I taper me tramadol script. Tapering almost completed so hopefully will be able to start testing it out in the next week or so.

a 75kg male found 20mg (of 4-aco-DALT) nasally active. felt ok in nose first (no burning like with most 2c* stuff), but got nastier gradually during the following 5-10 minutes.

by active he meant definitely ++, maybe +++ during a short peak. also worth mentioning, that he has a 3dl glass full of water with one drop of lsd in it, and took a sip of it in the morning that day, around 8 hours prior to snuffing the 4acoDALT...

fast onset (felt it within 5-10 minutes). body felt strange in the beginning for a while (shaking hands), but this faded away within 15 minutes, replaced by a nice soft warm feeling. he played Persistence is All by Time Machines (coil) while sitting in a darkened room in half-lotus posture for around 30 minutes. He enjoyed the music, even while not producing any visuals (as he has with other psychedelics). even audibly, he haven't found it much enhanced, as with other drugs, but somehow He felt the music more intensively anyway. after ~30minutes sitting in half-lotus, He unexpectedly and subconsciously started moving his hands and circling his hip, and found it pleasurable, so he started ?dancing? (slowly and smoothly, while the musick had no beats at all. just a monolitic drone)...which is strange, because he never dance, except for when on higher doses of mdma or DOI/DOB (and even then it's very rare phenomenon). After 60-90 minutes, he felt that the peak is gone and the effects are starting to fade away slowly. then he just listened to some more musick for 30 minutes and then gone to kitchen to talk to his flatmate..... Altogether, he was tripping for around 3 hours since snuffing it, and he was not sure if it was connected to 4acoDALT, but he found it hard to fall asleep 6 hours after snuffing, even while being quite tired already.

Wouldn't one be able to make it in vitro by letting it sit in an acidic or alkaline solution for a certain period of time?

I think I should be able to acquire this one i.e. the 4-AcO.


I am very curious about this, should be relatively similar with all the 4-AcO tryptamines right? Or is a special reagent needed perhaps?


Damn it, is this synth discussion? Tough call... reported it, hold the phone on answering this until people take a look at it.

edit: I'd say its not a problem, in my defense this has been discussed already: [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-262902.html](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/archive/index.php/t-262902.html)


Apparently letting it sit in an NaOH solution should do the trick, I'd experiment with the concentration and reaction time.

Nice to see some doses suggested in various forms. I still have mine here. Was gonna trial it last week. Then stuff happened and I'm back on the tramadol. I have no idea of the safety profile in conjunction with tram but have been caught out twice now and (barely) survived so not sure I'd like to risk it. I have no desire to remain on the feckin' tram... but it is the best anti-depressant a doc will ever prescribe here in the UK. Short of bupe or diamorph anyway.

4-AcO-DALT (F) [40 mg; orally; no tolerance; sitter]


The material was ingested at 1:00AM; last meal was consumed at 9:00PM.


Notes written during the trial:


*T+1:00: I'm at a barely discernible +1. I feel rather mellow, but I have perceived no true onset yet.


T+1:30: I'm at a light +1. There is very slight visual and aural enhancement. Tactile and skin sensations feel a bit nicer than when baseline. I'm sexually aroused to a mild degree. A gentle level of empathy is available. Introspection is easygoing. CEV's are non-existent. I feel slight tension on the back of my neck (but it's gone within fifteen minutes). Is this it?


T+2:00: Plateau?


T+2:30: Orgasm was nice, but nothing to write home about. I'm a little lightheaded. Humor is easygoing. I feel hungry.


T+3:00: I'm gently sedated but my hunger beckons... I'm off to the kitchen. Food tastes good.


T+3:30: There are extremely faint CEV's.


T+4:00: Coming down?


T+5:00: I'm fully back to baseline.*


Conclusion: The material is active at this level, but most folks (including me) would prefer the experience's chronology and primary effects to manifest with more clarity and force. This is without a doubt the least potent of the 4-AcO/HO/MeO compounds, at least with this ROA. Although this was an uneventful trial, there was a soft and appealing pleasantness to the experience.

Hi MGS,


100% real deal...


It seems like this material requires extremely large oral doses to achieve full psychedelic effects. I wager that other ROA's yield much more for much less... This is an expensive compound, so I don't recommend oral ingestion, unless one has a fair amount of cash to use for these experiments. On the other hand, non-oral intake of this is practically unknown... so be very careful, people.

Hello there.


I guess people need something to get excited about.  Kind of like how people were making their panties wet over 4-Ho-DPT, when the compound is practically inactive @ less than 50mg orally, and it offers nothing unique, and 5-MeO-DALT (while I am at it) is another worthless venture.  I suppose someone had to check it out but lack of oral activity below 50mg is the kiss of 'not worth my time' for nearly all compounds.

I generally agree, MGS. On the other hand, some folks find low doses of certain compounds to be "therapeutic"; perhaps oral doses in the range I tested could be useful for some.


I found 4-AcO/HO-DPT to be quite nice if insufflated... but yes, it is hardly worthy if used orally.

Just for the sake of interesting dialogue, what is therapuetic about it?  I could see it (both 4-AcO-DALT and 4-HO-DPT) being useful for cluster headaches, if one wants the benefits of a 5HT agonist without overt psychedelic action.  Does it offer something that 2-4mg of psilocin, or 3-6mg of psilacetin, cannot offer (other than the benefit of not being controlled)?  Maybe I missed something there.

It probably was a little bit like a slightly above threshold dose of psilacetin, but I can't confirm that because I've never bio-assayed that compound at such a low dose (excluding 1 milligram allergy tests).


What I find potentially "therapeutic" about 4-AcO-DALT at the tested dose/ROA (based on only one trial) is that it can gently open up channels of empathy and emotion, while leaving plenty of room for clear-headed introspection. It seems like this compound could be good for intimate conversation or to think.

I have tried this stuff recently, so thought I'd register as there didn't seem to be many reports.


I recently came across some 4-Aco-DALT through a friend who has tried most psychedelic RCs I can think of. He didn't tell me much, only that it was nothing like 5-MeO-DALT (which I haven't tried) and had more in common with mushrooms and other 4-substituted tryptamines. He also recommended snorting it, and said that he and friends found 80mg to be equivalent to approx. 2g dried mushrooms.


Anyway;


4-AcO-DALT Fumurate [100mg insufflated, no tolerance]


T+0:10 - some colour enhancement, faces seem to form out of anything circular, sounds seem distant


T+0:15 - mushroom like OEVs, a slightly nauseous feeling of constantly rotating or seasickness, definite 'tryptamine buzz' very much like 4-AcO-DMT, my hearing is slightly distorted, as if through a quiet ring modulator


T+0:30 - I decide to lie down as the nausea is getting a bit stronger. strong OEVs include waveforms flying out of the speakers and an anthropomorphisation of everything - clothes on the floor would form lions and panthers, and other animal faces would form from the junk in my room. I have only previously met psychedelic animals on Ayahuasca, though that was a less lighthearted affair.


T+1:00 - The trip finally starts to plateau. I lay down on my bed with my eyes shut watching the 'cosmic theatre' of various shadow-like entities, which was fascinating yet slightly intimidating. The entities did not really interact with me, as they might on mushrooms, and for this I was grateful as they did not seem particularly welcoming. There was more a feeling of observing things from a distance, not unlike a dissociative, unlike the more 'interactive' experience of other tryptamines I have tried, such as DMT.


T+1:20 - Coming down. The memories which seemed so clear only 10 minutes ago are already beginning to fade. My vision is still overlaid with incredible geometric patterns. I stand up, and the nausea returns a little for the first time since lying down, though nowhere near as badly. I sit down and drink some water.


T+1:35 The trip ends very suddenly and abruptly, though some tracers and mild CEVs remain. I feel a wonderful afterglow, not unlike DMT. I am surprised how alert and awake I feel mentally, though I still feel rather sluggish physically. Music sounds wonderful, and some weed an hour or so later brought back the CEVs a little.


Conclusion:


I would compare 100mg insufflated 4-AcO-DALT to approximately 3-3.5g dried mushrooms with a ~90 minute duration. The only other 4-substituted tryptamines I have tried are mushrooms and 4-AcO-DMT and it was very similar in character, moreso to 4-AcO-DMT than to mushrooms. This was also my first time snorting a tryptamine, so an oral experience may well be quite different. While not as 'spiritual' as mushrooms, it was none the less very introspective and philosophical in nature.


The nausea did put me off a little, and I think I would take mushrooms or 4-AcO-DMT over 4-AcO-DALT in future, though I would be willing to try it again orally if I ever came across any more. I think the best use of this compound is as a 'compressed' mushroom-like trip - by T+2:00 I was pretty much completely sober. However, I have not tried any other 4-substituted tryptamines so others may also have a similarly short duration when insufflated.

5-MeO-DALT avoids this by being an alkenyl substituent, and F&B says that this applies to plain ol' DALT as well. It would make sense if 4-AcO-DALT was also unscheduled, and gives the UK one legal psilocin analogue. Awesome!

I assume that NALT's would also be uk legal (but not MALT's, EALT's, PALT's and IPALT's). I wonder how active these compounds would be. 


I assume they have spent years sitting untasted in Shulgins lab.

I found that 80mg of 4-AcO-DALT (50mg bombed, 30mg insufflated) had pretty nice/reasonably strong effects - definitely similar to other 4-substituted tryptamines and not much in common with 5-MeO-DALT. 


Classic tryptamine OEVs were present such as very enhanced colours and lines, warping of visual field (phone screen seemed to turn square, then elliptical etc), seeing faces everywhere in shadows. Also a nice rushy body high which brought on the horniness a bit, so I decided to, er, service myself...


This took quite a bit longer than I was expecting and resulted in my laptop running out of batteries (thankfully 2 mins after the dynamite), and bluescreening on restart. Although I knew the reason for this error (Windows not loving a new Antivirus update) instead of just going to earlier restore point, in my enebriated state I managed to totally format my whole computer. Hah. So I would conclude that the substance is not as clear headed as, say 4-HO-MET. It has a touch of that mushroomy/4-HO-DMT/4-PO-DMT headtrip madness (that I like sometimes and not others). All in all, great stuff, just not as potent as most of the other 4-subs. Will go for 100mg bombed if I can get my mitts on this stuff again.

I discuss this material in the [4-HO-DPT Big & Dandy thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/430916-The-Big-amp-Dandy-4-HO-DPT-Thread?p=11879980&viewfull=1#post11879980).


Like others, I believe 80 to 90 mg is a reasonably strong oral dose, and that this compound is probably indifferantiable from 4-HO-DPT in terms of effects and dosage. Note however that 4-HO-DPT seems to have a dramatically steep dose-response curve over 100 mg, so be prepared.


The question of therapeutic potential of these materials is probably answered with ideas such as micro-dosing, as well as the fact that a 3 hour total activity possibly fits better a psychotherapy session than 8 hours of LSD or 20 minutes of DMT...

Is it worth 8 times the price of 5meo dalt?

How does it compare in terms of visuals and mood lift

And body rushes?

I'm no expert, and I don't even live in the US, but I'm pretty sure it's not illegal *per se*. But it being an analog of schedule one tryptamines it would be illegal to sell, buy and use as a drug.


So the answer is yes and no. Correct me if I'm wrong.


Edit: I see,You mean if its unique enough to not be an analog of something?  I'm not sure about that, but with the US analog laws it's always a grey zone.

Actually, I would think all of them should be given the act states:

So in theory the allyl substituent is an "other" substituent making MALT's, EALT's etc. all perfectly UK legal. Just how it looks to me.

Anyone have tried this compound lately?


I received some with 5-MeO-NiPT, 5-MeO-EiPT and 5-MeO-MALT ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Thank you !

Bit late but did you try it Kishka? I thought I responded to this thread but maybe not;

4AcO-DALT is really pretty good; at least as good as some of the other 4 subs imo; unfortunately it is too weak to bother orally and would suggest smoking/vaping. I haven't tried vaping other 4 subs so can't compare but definately a milder easier ride than DPT/DMT/5Me0 type things. Really nice and unique; light easy grace; it's own style of OEV and more internally the CEV too - some life and delicacy with the CEVs which I could compare vaguely to shrooms although there imtensity look and colour is very different to shrooms. This over shrooms anyday since a few have made comparison > much lighter and enjoyable and a great body high but basically very different in most respects. Many would find this a very acceptable and pleasing drug but pityfully weak - I'd love a full on oral dose - think that would be just lovely but just not realistically feasable at it's strength; thad it been cheap or more potent I think this would have had much more interest.

Sir Ron Pib, I actually just posted a trip report about this the other day seeking discussion because I didn't know anyone else who has tried smoking 4-AcO-DALT. It was my first attempt with it period and it pretty much matched up with what you said. The most noticeable thing to me was that it was indeed more lighthearted than DMT and related molecules but no less powerful, though overall I actually found the visuals to be more comparable to LSD than to other 4-substituted tryptamines in many ways, but still with its own unique spin. Unfortunately I also suffer from its low potency compared to similar psychedelics; I would absolutely love to take a full oral dose, but if I did then I would basically have none left to use in any other way. If I may ask, about what dose would you normally smoke, and how far have you pushed it? 15 mg was actually surprisingly strong for me, and I would like to take it further but am concerned about the lack of information about dosing, side effects, etc. If I had some evidence that 4-AcO-DALT is as safe as the other psilocin analogues seem to be, I would definitely be interested in trying to find a breakthrough dose with it.

When it started to sweep across me I thought wow! I supose because of that style it was a bit DPT like but I am thinking wow it's colour and style seem so different so not really LSD like but more that synthetic tryptamine style than the natural ones - aware psilocybin and DMT are very different but you know what I mean. The internal the visual were mild but I had a feeling of life or activity of great delicacy like one can get during the onset of mushroom visuals so there is a point of comparison but as I said the style was totally distinct and the rest wasn't like like them at all - very smooth; I was enchanted to find another new space on this .I've had 25mg and it felt safe enough and very friendly but with something new we can't know - there was a little mild nausea and my heart was elevated.

Only thing I didn't like is the smoke it's self; DMT and all those are easy and "tastey" to smoke; there is no indole scent and it is a bit rough; could really feel I had inhaled this stuff - I know some have smoked AcO-DET and the like - wonder if they share this quality - about a breakthrough dose or how much you have I don't know; just move up slowly I guess

Thank you very much for sharing. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I was very surprised by the color and style on the onset as well, though I have to say that honestly that was partially because of how LSD-like it was, haha. But don't get me wrong.... It was specific things about the visuals that reminded me so much of LSD, but the experience as a whole did not. And, specifically, it was things about the geometry and neon color flashes... not complex things, just sort of the basic foundation. Some very noticeably different things were, for one, the synthetic tryptamine vibe that you mentioned; I found it to be overall fairly similar to 4-HO-DET in the way my mind's eye imagery worked and passed over into perception at the peak, but there was also a distinctly different energy to it than I have experienced before which made it feel almost wild or untamed despite being easygoing and fun. Hard to describe exactly... but it does remind me of the trip report I read of it where someone described seeing animals in the visuals, I could definitely see that happening. Overall I did find it very unique, I definitely want to explore more. 25 mg is likely what I will try next, you're the second person I've heard of having an elevated heart rate at that dose now though so I will surely have to proceed cautiously.


Honestly, I had read that the smoke was harsh, but I didn't even notice it in between a bowl of cannabis. I normally taste DMT pretty strongly when I smoke it, but I have yet to notice anything significant with bufotenin, 4-AcO-MET, 4-AcO-DET, or 4-AcO-DALT. I may be in the minority here, so take that with a grain of salt. As for the breakthrough, I will definitely approach it carefully, but I have high hopes that it will not take enormous doses to reach, given how strong 15 mg already was for me. Thanks again, it's good to have more information on this!

I'd love to try 4AcO-MET - 4AcO-DiPT and 4AcO-DET I have and 4AcO-DALT fares well against them; smoking complicates comparison but looks the only viable way; the smoke was very rough and bitey for me and I was expecting some hyperspace smell but nothing. Oh well do get back with more results. Don't even know if anyone is supplying this anymore so it's a rare treat.

4-AcO-MET is a wonderful substance and comes highly recommended from me, but I must note that, unlike the others, I did not notice a significant increase in intensity or potency from smoking it compared to just eating it, and there was still a big drop in duration.... Personally I would stick to oral with this one, but maybe others have had more luck than I. Of the other three, 4-AcO-DET is definitely my favorite so far and 4-AcO-DALT may be a close second with future trials, but I really love them all in their own ways. I definitely will report back when I try more though; indeed, unfortunately the source from which my humble supply came no longer exists, so I have every intention of getting the most I possibly can out of it!

I tried smoking this again this morning, at 25 mg. Here's the trip report: [(4-AcO-DALT/25 mg smoked) - Second Time - Definitely Still Impressed](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/769969-%284-AcO-DALT-25-mg-smoked%29-Second-Time-Definitely-Still-Impressed?p=13243568#post13243568).


I have to say, though I still thoroughly enjoyed myself, this trip gave me much less enthusiasm about smoking it than the first one did. I may end up just risking what few oral doses I can in the future; even if it's not quite to where I want, I imagine it would probably still reach the strength of this smoked dose, and last for longer. That's certainly better than nothing.
