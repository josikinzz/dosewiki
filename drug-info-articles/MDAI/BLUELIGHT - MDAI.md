(Sorry to cosy up on you like this Ebola - quick fixes ftw)


***** Original Post *****​

I yield moderately strong fx at ~125 mg.  Just don't ruin it by expecting something very close to mdma.


This one's such a winner in combos.  Shame to see it becoming less common.

I agree.  I like the idea of being able to moderate neurotransmitter levels with highly selective compounds.  There's a whole world of greatness that's rejected by the myopic market. It's a tool people!  Sometimes you have to use more than one to build something magnificent! Learn yo' self fools!

I like the fact that this can be kept quiet when you are out and about, it's enjoyable for me even on it's own with a few beers. Must be my age showing but these days I like having frequent little extended 'above threshold' buzzes going, don't get me wrong I love occasionally getting fucked but not all the time.


If this batch proves to be as good as I think it's going to be I'll be stocking up on it in case it disappears completely, does anyone know offhand the shelf life/ideal storage for this one?

Could agree more, ebola. I've found it to be a worthy drug on its own, and it is a excellent base in combinations. Stunned it hasn't received a more positive response from the majority.

Yes... think of the impact on family & friends if you should end up in the hospital, all because of your buzz-greed.


I would guess AMT, as it is so highly stimulating, surely has NE and D releasing effects... if it also releases bunches of serotonin I would worry about serotonin syndrome on the combo, otherwise MIGHT be OK.


BUT:  Note the varying responses... one guy above said GF felt very jittery, so you would not want that then AMT on top of it.  You could well be one of the outlying very strong responders, in which case the combo could be disastrous.


You really need to try the contemplated dose of MDAI on its own first.  (And if you never did AMT before, for god's sake try that on its own first, too, only then reassess  combo experiment design; if you have, never mind.)

I think this is very good on its own at least the new batch, never tried the old one or combined this. It makes it especially good if it's really is non-neurotoxic. At least I haven felt any "toxic" effects (like with mdma, methylone or other neurotoxic drugs) even that I've redosed about 4 times and its still works great. Reading is great while on it (I read The Tibetan Book Of Dead in whole while on it), almost felt asleep tho' very sleepy stuff :D

I'm betting this will be very nice in combo with merely an OTC MiniThin EF 25/50 cap (25mg synephrine, 200mg caffeine, rhodiola, ginseng... EXCELLENT fairly mild easy up, easy down *Trucker Upper*... just made that up!  (C) DHoover!) which should provide just the right NE and D boost and prevent the sleepiness.

I read the first 30 or so pages of this thread and then ordered some MDAI..got around to reading the rest and I saw that people were complaining about the white MDAI. I believe thats what being shipped to me.. is it possibly any good or should I just throw it away?


Seems the consensus is MDAI is NOT white..

I'm aware most RC's should be white theoretically -- thats why I wasn't thrown off buying a white powder. However after reading the thread, pretty much everyone who has had the white MDAI said it is not MDAI, and that the tan or brown MDAI was the only legit stuff going around


I'd prefer an answer from someone with actual experience with MDAI..

Yeah...and life is comparatively long; we all have sufficient time to try drugs on their own when taking them for the first time. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I decided to try mdai last night after not receiving my benzo fury pellets as they had been delayed again. The mdai powder I got was advertised as being the purist yet. It was white in appearance and very crystally. I bought a gram and decided to put 100 mg each into 5 capsules so I could take at the charlatans gig I was attending.


We started off at the pub and I had a good 6 or so pints. I was in a good mood by then and decided to take a capsule (100 mg). I gave 1 to my friend too. After about and hour or so I didn't really feel anything. We had a couple of more drinks and decided to walk up to the venue. Before we left the pub I made the decision to take 2 more 100 mg capsules and gave my friend the last one.


45 minutes later we were standing outside the venue waiting on my mates friends turning up with his tickets that he'd stupidly left at home lol. It was then that I started to really feel something off the mdai. I felt very floaty and had a nice grin on my face. I'm very chatty with people now and the drink effects are beginning to wear off me. My mouth is very very dry now and just want to get inside to get a pint.


We get into the gig and decide to get another pint. By this time my vision has started to go and I'm finding it very hard to control. I'm grinding my teeth now and my body is tensing up. I'm really enjoying it by this point. With all the flashing lights I'm really finding it hard for my vision to stay focused. Iv took 300mg by this point. My friend who has took 200mg looks as fucked as me lol. He's enjoying it though. My girlfriend also keeps telling me that I looked fucking wasted. This is true but I'm really enjoying the buzz from this stuff.


The gig finishes at 11 and it's been 4 hours since I took the first capsule. Due to money reasons me and the girlfriend can't stay out so we head to the train station to go home. My eyes are still rattly at this point and I'm still grinding my teeth. I still have a nice happy buzz from this though and in the back of my mind I know I'm going to go home and take the last half gram of this stuff. I get very greedy at times lol.


On the train the girlfriend phones her mate and we arrange to meet at their house. I really need a drink of juice or water now as my mouth is that dry. I know I won't be consuming anymore alcohol. The mdai powder is all that's on my mind.


At about half 12 we get to her mates house with me and my half gram. As soon as I get there I'm in the kitchen taking 250 mg in a rizla skin. I don't have time to let that settle and I'm like fuck it, I'm gubbing the rest lol. Half an hour later then bang. I'm so fucked now. My heart is racing and my body is tensing up so much. My vision has completely gone now. I can't focus atoll. I'm loving it though. I'm just lying on the floor at this point with 3 people telling me how out of it I was. All I'm drinking now is diluted orange juice and the occasional fag. I feel this great buzz for a good 2 hours. Im not as talkative at this point i should add. Im just content lying on the floor and listening to there conversations. My girlfriend, her pal and her man are really drunk.


I'm very impressed with this powder so far. At 15 quid gram I find it reasonable 

too. 


It's 4 in the morning now and I'm beginning to feel a bit sick. This lasts for a good hour. I'm still lying on the floor and to be honest I can hardy move my body. My thoughts start to think about getting my girlfriend home and start fucking her lol. My dick has shrunk a little but not as much as say I'd been taking speed. So the girl tells me she want to go home. I get up from the floor and I'm struggling to walk. The thought of a fuck keeps me going. We only stay 2 minutes from our house so it ain't a long walk.


I soon as I'm in a rush to get all my clothes of and just lie in bed waiting on her coming in. I'm still buzzing like fuck and the sickness is fading. I have no trouble getting an erection but for the life of me can't cum. I can't get it out. I satisfy her though lol.


It's 6 in the morning now and I feel a bit rushy but my vision is back to normal. I smoke a few fags at this point and I'm cursing myself for not having beer in the house. I like to drink beer after I take uppers to try and kind of knock myself out to sleep. I think I fall asleep about 7ish. 


I get about 5 hours sleep before I have to pick my son up from grannies. When I wake up my jaw is a bit sore. No real sore head or that. I feel normal. At least I can still do stuff today now. I also don't feel grumpy atoll which I usually feel after taking uppers.


In conclusion, I really enjoyed this chemical. The only thing that would put me off taking this in public is my eyes rattling. I found this hard to control.


That's the first time iv ever wrote a trip report by the way lol. Iv been reading this site for a few months now and love it. There is a lot of information available on these boards. I just thought I'd offer something to it.

Oh it definitely sounds active from all the various reports I seem, at lower doses in combos, SLIGHTLY higher doses on its own.


But, pb109's amounts were pretty over-the-top... NOT RECOMMENDED!  No wonder he felt rotten later... sounds like serotonin syndrome, which CAN be dangerous.


It is a very selective and very potent Serotonin releaser, and just because it does not give you an amphetamine-like WHEEE buzz, is no excuse to gobble it up as though you were a dumb little kid eating candy... RESPECT these powerful medicines, please!

2X mdai?  I think someone is pulling your leg (or both legs... double strength!)


Unless all thats meant is a double dose (makes no sense as there is no std dose), this sounds absurd.  A molecule is a molecule.  Use your heads please people.  Evolution gave you a brain for a reason.

I have only had three batches of this stuff in total, two legit and one shit. The two legit ones have been tan, the shit was white crystally stuff that smelled/tasted of nothing and it's only effect was numbing my mouth so I binned it.


The first tan batch was mainly powder with some crystals and I had some good nights on it, the second batch is all tan crystals. The second batch is substantially stronger than the first but I am still doing it in 150mg doses, can't say I've ever had an experience like Pb109 though, not jealous at all... ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


It's just a really good mood enhancer for me, maybe I have lower grade stuff? Maybe Pb109 had some that was mixed with something else?


Does anyone else get similar off MDAI on it's own?

You mean people don't want MDAI?


I'd love some MDAI (I enjoyed the tan stuff a lot), but have been sold so much weak shit or stuff that most likely isn't MDAI (including one substance that had visuals equivalent to a mushroom trip) that I just can't be arsed trying to procure it any more.

Powdery dark brown stuff is crap.  You might as well swallow cocoa powder instead.


Oh, it's all made even worse by the fact that no-one's ever said definitively what pure MDAI should look like.  Surely something so basic should be easy to establish?

I have been sent a large free sample of this drug in white powdery/small crystals variety.


I done some research on this and found that mdai is supposed to test dark red with marquis.


Then I see a video on a vendors site and it turns black.


My sample turns yellow/light brown.


My sample comes from a lab not a vendor complete with spec sheet.


But which one is real? The lab is very very well respected and produces the nmr`s for most of the uk vendors but why is mine yellow with marquis?


I havent tried it yet.


Anyone else tested their white crystal mdai and had it turn yellow/brown and can give postive reports on it?

most of the "white crystalline" mdai has turned out to be various different things, usually not MDAI though, AFAIK

I'm fairly certain it should turn Marquis red. Some of the cathinones turn Marquis yellow and would be my suspicion given there are so many sloshing about that need to be dumped. Test results for MDAI (that was definitely MDAI) I recall seeing were all red (kinda browny red from memory).

Thanks Shambles for some sort of confirmation, it's appears from what I've read here that this very white looking power that's now on offer from a vendor, who's claiming it's very pure grade (that's why it's so white um) isn't in fact MDAI & should be avoided really.

It SHOULD be close to white... 98% of the time color in a pure molecular substance are due to impurities.  Some things do have color however.  It should be possible to google and discover at some chemistry site the natural color of the pure compound.


Criminey... did you think to even check the authoritative Erowid?  How come?  They have an MDAI vault containing the following picture... slightly off-white, but certainly not tan or brown:


![mdai_summary1.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.erowid.org%2Fchemicals%2Fmdai%2Fimages%2Fmdai_summary1.jpg&hash=145e6c56777c0a2f9d055cfe22a1470d)


Are you 100% certain Marquis should be red?  Sounds like it is still rumors and urban legends to me.  Get some and test it and let us know what happens.


Well, a simple search of [mdai color] gave this... I am sure you can find out more... jesus people, dont so fuckin lazy... do a little proper research, more than just reading druggie groups like this, but GOOGLE then DIG and READ!!!  It's not that tough to do.


[http://www.morefreeinformation.com/...he-web-Here-is-some-solid-Recommendation.html](http://www.morefreeinformation.com/Art/71609/24/Want-to-buy-MDAI-on-the-web-Here-is-some-solid-Recommendation.html)


(MODS - despite the title there are NO vendors mentioned or hinted at) Partial excerpt:


*Analysis report - Correct retailers will certainly have an analysis report of the substances they are selling if you might be in doubt about the high quality of mdai an internet site may be offering ask the seller for an evaluation report. 


Colour - MDAI when large in purity is white. A great deal of internet websites offer MDAI as a brown substance, in this case it really is either impure or merely not MDAI. 


Once you uncover a retailer you can trust i would advise you stick to them lots of web site also provide a loyalty bonus when you subscribe to their service and newsletter. Of course should you do locate another reputable seller you could use them as effectively just make sure you test their services obtain starting with tiny amounts. 


Just to go over the keynotes again. MDAI should be white and not brown in colour. If the selling price is as well great to be true then it most likely is. The product must not be as well cheap and possibly a banned substance. Purchase from a site that provides you their contact data. Obtain from a vendor that provides recorded delivery and tracking. 


If you stick to the guidance given above you shoul highly minimize the risk of getting inferior MDAI or obtaining ripped off.*

Look at the illuminated left side of the stuff in the spoon (not the right side in shadow).  Be sure brightness of your monitor is not dimmed.  Now compare the color of what's in the spoon to something else pure white on your computer.  Now compare it to the brown/tan tones in the table.  Which does it look most like.  Perhaps slightly grey, but not at all tan.  Third opinions, please?


I dont see how anyone can think a tan RC is proper.  Its not.  It indicates lousy unclean synth, no doubt.  Probably the lack of effect from pure white stuff is that it is from what I gather a fairly subtle substance on its own.  If you take the tan stuff and you feel GRRREAT and get a real good buzz, my guess would be that's because the tan stuff is SOMETHING ELSE, like a kitchen sink synth of meth diluted by something.  I'm pretty sure MDAI does not give much of a "buzz", only a subtle enhancement.

How does "impure" equate to "legit"?    IMO impure = garbage or error that cant be sold to research orgs being offloaded to what vendor takes as stupid desperate gullible druggie dummies.  Fuck that.


I guess you mean its got actual MDAI in it, but also a bunch of other solvent and crap left over from a lousy, lazy synth.  Yuck.


I say keep looking for the real pure thing.  It must be out there.


And I certainly would not discount the vendor saying he has real pure clean stuff just because he says its white.

bingo.  I should've said, "'legit'". ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

When there is MDAI going around that's impure enough to affect potency, and then some other drug mixed with an inert carrier, the former is "legit". ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

My monitor or eyes may also be failing me, but I would definitely call that colour tan. In fact, that looks just like the (tan) batch I was thinking of that was known to be (mostly) pure that turned Marquis red. I imagine the purest possible MDAI would be white but so far every white batch I know of has not been MDAI at all (or has been heavily cut with whatever unsold cathinone the vendor had too much of) so people are naturally dubious of brilliant white batches at the moment. There have been much darker brown batches which were known to be MDAI but very impure. They really were a dark, chocolatey brown though. They also turned Marquis a reddish colour (eventually) I think. Bunk batches (and so far they have do all seem to be the white ones) have generally turned Marquis yellow or no change from memory.

I guess "tan" comprises a rather wide range... google [color tan], pick "images for color tan"... one of them looks downright GREY to me... I would never call it "tan"... tan I think is meant to mean "light brown"... anyway, seems we have a definitional issue.  If you think the sample looks like the GREY version of tan OK... but it looks nothing like any of the LIGHT BROWN versions.  Or see here:


[http://www.google.com/images?client...tle&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQsAQwAA&biw=1177&bih=568](https://www.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=color+tan&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&source=univ&ei=yvizTJHXJ8ienAetls3nDA&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&ct=title&resnum=1&ved=0CCUQsAQwAA&biw=1177&bih=568)


This is getting pretty humorous to be honest.  Rather like the portion of this in  room 12a (with John Cleese behind the desk):

Teehee. I've always loved that sketch, you snivelling great heap of parrot droppings ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


If I was doing the colour comparison thing I'd compared it with the car or the one below it on the left of that Google thingy. I'm sure everybody has a slightly different idea of what somewhat nondescript colours are but the powder in the Erowid pic looks like UK heroin which is generally described as brown/tan colour. As I have a bit of history with heroin it seems to be my natural reference point for all things tan. As such, whenever I describe something as tan (MDAI, the early batches of 6-APB and MDPV and so on) I was meaning something that looked rather like the Erowid pic.


I suspect arguing the toss over personal perceptions of colour is unlikely to go very far but short of posting a PD Colour Chart for reference I guess we'll have to live with the chaos for now. I must admit I'm sorely tempted to start a poll on the subject though :D

nope, MDAI is selective for serotonin.  Most people report it slightly sedating or relaxing unless used in combo with a stimulant.  


And I think the stuff in the pic looks tan, much like the 1st batch of MDAI i bought.  The only guy I know that has had white MDAI did a heptane wash on a brown batch.  Which raises the question, why won't any vendors clean up their products if need be?  Seems a bit ridiculous.

I would like to add to this post to say I've found a vendor who is actually supplying real mdai, i've been screwed that many times, and to be honest, didnt expect much from this batch, think I eyeballed (yes I know) around 100-125mg and snorted, I had the white stuff not brown, and dam its hit me like a steam train, it feels like the MCat feeling that I used to get in my chest and stomach, real euphoria.


I genuinely am shocked! But am over the moon that MDAI turns out to be real after a number of let downs!


I've had to take a K-Pin to relax it a little bit.


Definately feel more in control than with 4MMC but I'm glad I didnt have anymore lets put it that way. It doesn't feel like there is naphyrone in it, which would be the usual these days, as that did nothing but keep me awake for 3 very long days.


I'm genuinely impressed with this stuff now!!! ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Sounds kinda like the complete opposite of MDAI, to be honest. MDAI is the anti-meph - couldn't be more different if it tried. The MDMA comparison may be unoriginal but it really did feel rather a lot like MDMA on Mogadon to me - massively loved up and mightily mellow and dreamy. I've only had the tan batch that was around a few months back which was known to be reasonably pure and came as a freebase.

Well its levelling off now, I disagree, I never said it was stimulating as such, but the euphoria and spaceyness was somewhat of a shock considering my experience with previous batches.


I personally think this is just pure MDAI. It has the lovey euphoria effects of MDMA but I'm still yawning etc so no stim effects, I think its the real deal very clean white powder, any thoughts??

Nobody can say what you have cos we don't have it. Would be the first legit white MDAI I know of - maybe you got lucky, maybe you didn't but at least got a decent chem instead of the usual shite.

Does sound somewhat stimmy to me and is possibly why it's levelling off now?

I found MDAI to be motivating if not quite stimmy (though I did have with vodka + red bull with it).  Certainly made me want to go out for a late night walk + also chat to people online rather than sit on the sofa.

In fact, that looks just like the (tan) batch I was thinking of that was known to be (mostly) pure that turned Marquis red. I imagine the purest possible MDAI would be white but so far every white batch I know of has not been MDAI at all (or has been heavily cut with whatever unsold cathinone the vendor had too much of) so people are naturally dubious of brilliant white batches at the moment. There have been much darker brown batches which were known to be MDAI but very impure. They really were a dark, chocolatey brown though. They also turned Marquis a reddish colour (eventually) I think. Bunk batches (and so far they have do all seem to be the white ones) have generally turned Marquis yellow or no change from memory.

I see tan moving towards brown in that picture, and it is nearly identical to the material that I saw in real life.

Must be something wrong with my eyes then... I see ZERO yellowish or brownish tones in the clumpy powder in the spoon.


Look... compare the powder to the lightest of the tones in the table top to the right... those are definitely TAN.


Now compare it to the puire-whitelight source highlight in the upper right portion of the spoon.


It looks WAY WAY WAY closer to the pure white highlight than to the tan in the tabletop to me.


I think theres some kind of optical illusion like effect of nearby colors going on here.


NOTE: when I tilt my LCD back so that it does that viewing-at-an-angle dimming thing they do, I will admit it takes on a tan cast.  Hmmm... perhaps thats a clue and if the color was really a grey it would just look grey with a tilted screen... when viewed at full brightness via straight-on viewing, it looks purely grey to me... so maybe it is a combination of my monitor and my aging eyesight.


When I have time I'm going to use a paint program and actually sample the color of the pixels in the powder to see if it is closer to grey than any any color (i.e., R/G/B close be equal).  And perhaps cut out only the well-lit left half of the powder and put it all alone in the middle of a BIG patch of white and also black and then see what it looks like.


This is driving me nuts!  Sorry!

Another adjective I'd use to describe the good stuff is 'sandy' - sandy/tan I think gets you within the right ballpark, but deffo not white or cocoa powder brown!

Did you just discover that you are color blind perhaps? I have 2 different computers here in front of me and the picture is the same to me in both, tan bordering on brownish/mocha on the dark side of the spoon.

Agreed, that power is tan almost brown.


Anyhoo - I have some white MDAI on the way from a vendor with good reviews, and they swear to me up and down their product is MDAI and that they have had it tested and confirmed.


I've never had it before but I've every thread on bluelight about it so I have a good idea what the effects should be. 


When a bluelighter cleaned their brown MDAI with a heptane wash they got white crystals, and the supplier of the tan MDAI only claims 92.5% pure, so I'm sure pure MDAI more then likely is white


I think most of the white powder sold as MDAI probaly isn't -- but if you get lucky you can probaly find the real deal


I think I have about a 60/40 chance of getting bullshit/real white MDAI

Ok Ok I give... never had any indication I am color blind... the monitor tilting experiment has me thinking its a screen color/brightness adjustment issue on my end that I've become adapted to... and I've not looked at it on any other monitor, so....


I hereby dissolve my obsessive compulsiveness on the topic... thanks to Shambles for putting up with me for so long!  Well at least it's been somewhat entertaining.  No it Hasnt!  Yes it has!

So... verifies presumption that brown does NOT = goodness in pretty much any pile of what is supposed to be a single pure molecule (except perhaps in a very small number of unusual substances).   Active MDAI samples out there so far being brown just means mostly only crappy stuff has been available, unfortunately.

Thanks, you've pretty much answered my post/question that I ended up deleting the other day - asking about impurities or even the fact the MDAI having a brown colour to start with perhaps skewed some of the Marphis results in the past, resulting in a browny/red colour showing (it would make a lot of sense especially if the person you quoted is correct in stating it should be clear/no change) . Still I'd like to hear more on this to be certain, I might order this new powder as I'm pretty eager to give it a go, never tried any of the other crap due to not wanting to screw with my body, don't enjoy much stimulation either so it should be interesting.

On second thoughts something smells very fishy here, I'm gonna stay clear of this so called MDAI for now. The white coloured "MDAI" on sale at the moment is shown on the vendor site fizzing, giving off smoke & turning very dark brown immediately after the test solution is applied (they claim this stuff is 99.8% pure too).

I don't understand, so the brown MDAI is not just impure but also completely inactive?


Thought it definitely effected me about half a year ago when I tried, then again, I suppose it could just be the power of the placebo. 


Still had some left that I thought of giving a go next week but may as well bin it now

I have brown HCL MDAI from the thai vendor, and while I would estimate it at 45% purity, it's definitely active but impure as fuck, smells like rubber. The difference between the brown freebase and hcl is easy to tell, one is solid and the other is a sand.

Yea, from one single sentence remark you totally know my "character."  8)


What did I say that was so horribly offensive as to require an apology?  I was just disucssing what I thought I saw... later I agreed that there must be something off about MY monitor once everyone else said they saw "tan" or "brown".  You expect me to make an effort to come back and lick your hand?  Gimme a break.

This is getting very interesting.  I find MDMA and Methylone both make be really horny... more so the latter, and on MDMA I cant seem to do much about it.  While on Methylone once the absolute peak passes, I *CAN* do something about it, so adding MDAI to Methlone sounds like it might be hella fun.

I didn't feel a significant increase in sexuality any time I took mdai. All the other effects were there and since I got the white version from a trustworthy vendor, they were really really good/strong. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My hornyness/ability to perform sexual acts is very easily affected for the worse by many things (e.g. alcohol), so I wouldn't take that as a definite no, it might just be me or I might just have had a bad day. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) What I will say though, is that the music and little details in the porn I watched to answer this very question, were more interesting at that time. I also involuntarily imagined kissing and cuddling the women I tried to fantasize about.

I hear its supposed to be a great aphrodisiac with MDPV, though I don't think my batch of THAT was the real deal...

For many months now there has been an ongoing debate as to which colour of MDAI is the best one to buy or highest in purity. There was much speculation over whether or not the brown compound was even MDAI at all. Tests showed that much of the brown MDAI was as described but very impure. This led to the increased popularity of the white powder version.


It fitted in more coherently with the nickname ‘sparkle’ as there were tiny sparkling crystals in what most vendors were selling. Unfortunately some samples came back with less than 80% purity and many did not contain MDAI at all, some even were laced with mephedrone.


While many customers and vendors were happy with the product they were buying and/or selling, it has recently been discovered that a huge amount of white MDAI actually contains class C controlled substances, namely BZP (benzylpiperazine) and TFMPP (trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine).


It is thought the reason for this is because the combination of the two chemicals actually mimics the effects of MDMA. As MDAI does the same, it was easy for labs to sell this stuff labelled as MDAI and also much cheaper than actually producing MDAI.


It is definitely a strong possibility that if you have purchased white MDAI recently then you actually bought BZP and TFMPP which are class C controlled substances

some report anti-depressant effects at 10-25mg.  Recreational doses are substantially higher, most report using 75-150mg per dose.  It isn't at all like MDMA though, on its own anyway.

i agree it works great in combinations, however id warn against the m1 and mdai combo, it is apparently more neurotoxic than each on its own (cant find the link now). also from experience, this is the only combo where i felt a crash after usage, even though i didnt get that from either.


i agree with the dosages give, some even go higher, but id advise to start low, batches differ in potency (i started with a batch that gave me wonderful feelings at 100, but met one that did nothing special until above 150).


as for effects... we all know they vary quite a bit. personally i find a recreational dose is wonderful for a night out w/ friends or meeting new peole but not partying hard, and would take this over 4 beers anyday

yeah, most found snorting ineffective IIRC.  And combining MDAI with any DA and/or NE releaser is going to make it more neurotoxic, based on the current model of MDMA neurotoxicity, though i think there are some problems with that model that are just starting to be known.  Either way, i'd venture a guess that the combinations are a bit more neurotoxic than either alone, but as long as you do these things in moderation, it shouldn't be much of a problem.

well the duration of 4-FA is much longer than that of MDAI, so that's one drawback.  However otherwise it sounds like a decent combo.  I'd give it a try ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

well i wasnt really thinking of covering the whole length of the 4fa. i know it lasts a while. but more like, having the 4fa first then a few hours in having a little mdai to spice things up a bit, especially during the rather bland stimful second half of 4fa

From what I've read, that seems like MDAI, although I do not think it should be that brown.


I would recommend buying a marquis test to guarantee what you have is indeed MDAI; we cannot accurately identify some unknown powder of yours by an anecdotal report and picture of the substance.

Hello and thank you for your answer. Yes of course you cant indentify it 100 % just by looking at a picture, so I think I am going to order a marquis test. 


What colour will MDAI be on a marquis test?


And if it isnt MDAI, what else can it be than? Is there any substance that has that similar effects? Maybe it is MDAI but just very impure.

I do, I received 50grams of that same product from that same vendor, with that same burnt rubber smell.


I dose it at 250mg, you're looking at ~40-50% pure MDAI. Utter shit, when they changed back from freebase to HCL I was hoping they weren't fucking around, but not like I can complain now.

Ive tried this twice now and from what I'd read I was expecting to be underwhelmed. On both occasions I got the dark brown stuff looks like coffee granules. The first time I did it I split a Gram between a friend. Made 2 300mg bombs and then 2 200mg bombs. The first 300mg bomb was like a fairly average pill but it was only when I bombed the second lot did it REALLY hit me. It felt like a full on pill...eyes flutering...pulling gibs the full monty!

Last night I did 4 300mg bombs and I was completely muntered. I loved it....as close to legal pills and although not as mental as meph I'd say stick with it...its a slow builder and its really warm, euphoric best of all...it enhances music..something meph didnt do for me.

**Blue Agricultural Scams MDAI**


*snip*


This site scams MDAI.


They sent me 1gram of "MDAI" which had zero effect even at 500mg.


The powder was tasteless and consisted of large crystals looking almost like seasalt or sugar. ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

Hi all, thought id join up and say hello after lurking here for a few weeks. I purchased half a gram of mdai from a reputable source a few weeks back. It was white in appearence, and chrystaline as well. First of all i took about 5mg as a reaction test.


 Later on that evening i took about 200mg as first dose, after about 45 min to an hour, i felt different, but nothing too special, so took the rest. About an hour and a half after inital dose i felt happy, alert and content but nothing more really. No euphoria or other mdma like effects that other people on here have been talking about. After feeling like this for about 3 hours, it started to have quite a sedating effect on me but not being able to sleep.


From my experience, it is a mild stimulant, nothing more nothin less. People expecting to get off thier head will be disappointed, but i can see potential in it. Especially mixed with other things to bring out the best in it.


On that note i see some people on here have tried different combos, and was wondering if anybody knows if it's any good mixed with dmaa? Yes i know its not the greatest, but ive been off legal and illegal substances for a few years, and lost all contacts lol. i suppose something is better than nothing. Im looking to give other RC's serious 'lab time' soon, as soon as they are available again.

Kinda bummed after reading this thread..looks like MDAI is not a good idea if you are on anti-depressants (which I am).  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Last night I took 4 100mg "mdai tablets" now this was teamed with a lot of alcohol and I thoroughly enjoyed myself, felt spacey on occasions, and tonight, I know its work in the morning too, too 2 more of these "tablets" and I am experiencing my usual effects from a drug, wreching (always), needing to take a trip to the little boys room, pilly willy lol etc etc, fine when sitting feeling maybe a little bit distant, I imagine thats the hangover though, but when walking outside for a smoke I have a definate light headidness, every now and then a dull pleasurable tingling in my legs and hips it seems to move all over.


I'm still unsure to be honest though. I just hope the effects wear off so I sleep before 6am like last night.

I've seen people rolling balls off of 300mg of the 40-50% purity coffee brown MDAI, if you had white crystalline and took 500mg, I'd kinda question that. Of course, ymmv, but if I had dosed even 300mg of pure, I'd probably be floored.

well tonight i am planning a long new years eve party.


so what do you people think of a 4FA + MDAI combo? 


was thinking of something in the lines of ~120mg 4FA around 9pm and then at 11pm drop the mdai (~200mg of the coffe coloured one) for a very comfy new years eve.


not looking for a complete roll, just energy to dance, good hornyness for afterparty sex and not be completly fucked up so i can enjoy a mushroom trip on sunday evening.

I have done 160 4FA and 150 mdai similar way as you are planning. It was good, mdai brought some high back but not too much. Mind that my mdai was the dark one which is said to be not very pure so you may have much better experience. Good luck and happy NYE ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

"also curious wether the increased sex endurance was due to the 4fa or the mdai, or the combo. ideas?"


can't speak for 4fa - but mdai alone certainly increased sex endurance alot for me!

Hi all!  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

(i'm new here)

so.. as i see, vendor names are not allowed... but what about vendors that are no longer active? (i mean.. does not exist any more... closed for good) ?

in that case, that would not be sourcing, right? as they are no more a source...


anyway, i have one gram of "white MDAI" from UK vendor that is now closed (closed one month ago) so i just want to ask what i have here? 

maybe not MDAI at all? 

as i can read here on bluelight, almost all "white mdai" from UK vendors is not mdai at all?

(and i dont want to take this if it is not mdai)

i'll do marquis tomorrow (and post here) but as i understand it will not tell me much about what i have here...

maybe it would be much more helpful to hear some bio-assay??  ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) 

(if anybody tried mdai from this same UK supplier)

at least to see what to expect... so please, comment if you have tried this batch...


it is from UK vendor that is closed one month ago (and website does not exist any more) 

"m" was the first letter (i'll post name if that is allowed for vendors that does not exist any more?)...

its true that alot of the white "MDAI" in the UK market isnt' MDAI. And i think its still against the rules to mention defunct vendors.

an interesting experience on ~250mg of the brown mdai (had it from an older source) combined with a few alcoholic drinks (beer and wine).


took it around midnight, set was a bar/club with a few freinds. first effects felt after ~30 mins, with a peak after about 1h that lasted a bit over an hour, with a pleasureable aftereffect. I felt energetic, calm, charming, very open to discussions (chatting up girls seemed very natura/easy, though normally im a bit more introverted). Ended up walking a girl home, on the way chatting various nothings. Hugging felt great. The alcohol was barely felt throught, but i was hardly aiming for intoxication. No need for food, and after the peak there was quite a need for watering of the mouth, but not to the extent of methylone cotton mouth.

what can i say, a positive experience, with little hangover effects. its not the "most" anything (energetic, emphatic, stimmulating), it is a nice experience, a good pick me up for a relaxing night out. 


A side note. a friend of mine also took it in combination with methylone (~200mg m1 with maybe 50mg mdai) and he noted he could not sleep for lot longer than just the m1, with little other changes. It might be just a freak coincidence though.

Anyone tried this with JGG's?


I'm after a suggested dosage. I've had 500mg bomb of the JGG's which were nice but combined with MDAI it's meant to be really good. I don't want to take 500mg of JGG though. I was thinking 350mg of JGG and 150mg of MDAI?


This sound okay?

Jolly green granules. Very Mephedrone feel to them. With MDAI being primarily acting on seratoning release it's meant to be a good combo but I haven't seen enough reports to fully trust the combination yet.

I was wondering what the effects of using MDAI two days in a row would be.  I know from MDMA that you are supposed to space rolls a month apart.  But MDAI isn't neurotoxic nor is it all that similar to MDMA.  I just got a gram of it in the mail today so I tried it, but I have a good occasion for it tomorrow also.  Is MDAI a drug that can work well 2 days in a row or will I just be wasting it?

I ended up doing it two days in a row.  Both times I took 200 mg.  The first time, I mixed it with 12 grams of bali kratom.  The second time, I mixed it with 12 mg of MDPV.  I enjoyed both experiences a lot.  When mixed with kratom, it felt extremely euphoric and MDMA like.  It felt nearly identical to a good roll.  The only difference was that there was less stimulation.  When mixed with MDPV, it felt kinda like a roll, but more mild.  When I took it with the kratom, I chilled in my house through out the whole experience.  Today, when I took it with the MDPV, I was skiing through the whole experience.  Both times were quite successful.

Uh, so I wanted to post a pic of my MDAI from one of the trusted big 5. As you can see it's white and quite crystalline, although I've noticed it has a sort of iridescent quality and can look tan/yellowish if observed from different angles. Done it a few times with my mates and it fits the effects profile of MDAI: not stimy, clear headed empathy, fantastic in combination.


Combos my crew & I have explored thus far:

20MG 2c-B + 200MG MDAI

20MG Adderall + 200MG MDAI

80MG Methoxetamine + 150MG MDMA + 200MG MDAI 


~I was thinking I might combine 200MG of MDAI with 4-7MG of Foxy [5-meO-DiPT] I was thinking a low dose of Foxy to sidestep body load and 200MG of MDAI to give it a bit more glamour. Anyone see any reasons why this might be contraindicated?

I wrote a trip report about one of my combos.  You can find it [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=549094).  Also, for the record, I think I have the same stuff as hyperobjects.

I found I reached a very surreal mindset with mdai. Surely it must be stimulating as I was gurning and chatting away?

I've had some odd experiences with this one. All my trials have been with the finely crystalline white MDAI. 


Doses from 70-150mg produced a nice, dreamy yet clear-headed state. When added to a methylone+butylone combo, slightly enhanced effects were felt (though they're hard to differentiate from the m1/b1, my doses were on the low side that night. Wasn't looking to get clobbered).


I had one scary experience with ~200mg bombed with ~12mg 2c-e. I had been doing small bumps of the stuff prior to the bombing too, so probably had around 300mg of MDAI in my system. The plan for the night was to go to a "rave" house party, trip and be happy and free, and then pass out for the night. 


Around a half hour after taking the combo I started becoming dizzy and lightheaded. This increased to the point where I blacked out trying to "escape" the party that had yet to really begin, stumbling outside and collapsing against the wall. As I was sitting down with my head between my knees, I was FIGHTING to keep conscious, kinda felt like a really really intense head rush that would not dissipate. Eventually I felt okay enough to stumble home and collapse on my bed, feeling weak and shaky and just all around shitty. It was about that point that the 2c-e started to kick in, so I spent the rest of the night at home smoking cannabis and lightly tripping.


I'm not really sure what happened that night, but it sounds a lot like I induced minor serotonin syndrome. Just throwing the warning out there, it IS possible to overdo it on this one, as harmless and subtle as it feels.

That's quite true.  My friend had a pretty bad experience after ingesting 400 mg by accident.  On my recommendation, she was trying to repeat the kratom and MDAI experience I found to be great.  Both the kratom and MDAI were in gel caps.  My friend accidentally took a second 200 mg dose, mistaking it for a kratom gel cap.  She was alright, but had an overwhelming night and ended up blacking out for a few hours.  The next day, she felt hungover and slow, but didn't feel like she suffered any permanent damage.  Still, it is evident that some batches of MDAI are much more potent than others.  Some people on here talk about taking 300-400 mg like it's nothing.  If anyone here is used to this dosage, I'd suggest being extremely careful when getting a new batch, unless blacking out from a serotonin overload sounds pleasant.

@absolute757 honey, it's against the rules to ask sourcing questions. surprised the mods haven't seen that and yelled at you yet. &some people spent a great amount of time finding legit sources and are probs unlikely to share with someone whose only made 2 posts to BL, also still having green lighter status you can't read PMs yet anways. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) ya though.

On the methoxetamine thread someone mentioned a overdose/death from someone IVing Methoxetamine with 400MG of MDAI. Can anyone source this?

I am going to sound like the Jaded raver I am. Please for the love of god if someone injected 400mg of mdai then then they would likely die. I honestly pray that this was not the case.

So I've got 2g of MDAI otw from what seems like a pretty reliable UK vendor.. And I'm looking to shoot it (sorry info.trance).


I've tried the brown stuff before a while back so I know what to look for in terms of effects, so as to make sure it's actually MDAI before putting it in my veins, and am properly prepared with wheel filters and such..


I was just wondering if anyone can recommend a starting dosage? 25-50mg?

Or a reason why this isn't a good idea - I'll just have to try shooting the PV then :s

Shooting MDAI doesn't really even seem like it would provide a rush benefit. Its not exactly a drug known to provide a rush. I'd try plugging it if you must have it kick in extra quickly. Shooting just seems like a waste and an unnecessary danger given the state of MDAI on the market (never seemed too pure even from "quality" vendors). There was a site that supposedly sold it along with 6-APDB (under the alternate EMA-4 nomenclature), a long time ago (well before it hit the "general market" with the meph ban looming). I wonder if it was ever provided as a pure product.

first ingest orally and gauge baseline effects. IF you absolutely must grimsolem. At least your dosage is in the realm of something resembling safe (I still disagree with shooting it but at least your sensible)


At least you rule out the possibility of it being other things. 


We found that dosing between 140 mg and 160 Orally was fairly effective Lazy Science don't bother with intranasal its fairly fail that way

I found 200 mg to be very nice but not too much.  Still, everyone is different and it would be wise to work your way up, starting with an allergy dose.

I gel cap it so I can't comment on the taste.  It works just fine swallowed.  I suppose you could try sublingual without risking anything but I don't think it's necessary.

so, i tried it yesterday taking 500mg over about 4 hours. i quite enjoyed the effects but there was a major problem - i just could not piss at all no matter how hard i tried. i was absolutely bursting for a piss all day and the pain was excruciating. eventually after about 5 hours of trying, i  managed to empty my bladder but it took about an hour to do so because the piss was just dribbling out. this has never happened to me before on any drug.


this experience has totally put me off taking mdai again.

Does anyone know how often MDAI can be used without running into problems?  I know you're supposed to space MDMA rolls at least a month apart, but MDMA is far worse for you than MDAI, at least assuming you don't combine the MDAI with a dopamine releaser.  I've used MDAI two days in a row once and felt no ill effects.  The one time I used MDMA twice in six days, I felt like absolute shit.  


MDAI feels like a pretty benign substance, but I realize that damage could be occurring without me feeling it.  When reading about MDMA, I always was led to believe that depleted serotonin levels were responsible for the temporary depression after rolling.  Yet, after using MDAI, I'm not depressed.  So what gives?  Is MDAI really that much safer to use on a more frequent basis, or is the lack of side effects not indicative of what is really going on?

From the literature, all we know is that "it's probably safe." There isn't much, if any, neurotoxicity. The only thing I would worry about is a crash, particularly one that results from serotonin depletion over time if you keep using MDAI. For example, using it daily for a week might have a crash the following week. As your body develops a tolerance it will begin making less serotonin to compensate. This isn't specific to MDAI but to drugs in general.


Another worry I would have is the diminishing positive effects of the drug if overused.


I was using methylone every 2-3 days the past month. No crash and no real negative effects. This morning I haven't used it (about 1 week) and I'm very depressed and anxious. BUT! I'm at baseline. I had forgotten how disabled depression and anxiety can be, and it's something I've had all my life, but I just now realized that the methylone was very therapeutic in that it had an afterglow between dosing. One that persisted as I continued using the drug. So I had no major crash or issues.. and maybe this also applies to MDAI?

Have a similar but less extreme problem with DXM sometimes. That will put your body into shock and warrant a trip to the ER to be catheterized. Very dangerous.

Does anyone know what was in that brown/tan/glittery MDAI that was doing the round after the meph ban last spring? I bought some recently that is completely white & works at the 25-50mg dosage range & lasts a good few hours, albeit much more sublte that meph.


The old brown/tan/glittery MDAI doesnt work til I get up to the 150mg plus mark & comes on with a rush not unlike meph & wear's off with a strong redose urge also common with meph. Do I have a bag full of cut, brown mephedrone??? If not, what the hell is it?

You would smell the mephedrone, pure and simple ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png). 


I received 50g of the brown MDAI last summer and I dosed it at 220mg and received effects I would read online about doses about ~125mg. I've not read much about getting a good dose off of as low as 25mg, no matter how pure, it's simple more of a weak chemical. While I think you don't have mephedrone, I'd suspect it's not exactly MDAI. You described the effects as different, as well as the dosage, I bet it's not MDAI or has another chemical cut into it. No one can really tell without real lab analysis.

Dosed 220mg of MDAI @ 7pm + 15mg 2c-b insufflated @ 8:30pm 1.5 hours after the MDAI dose = the sex.


I was hanging out with a couple of my mates last and we all dosed the same doses, ended up taking our clothes off and rubbing and cuddling up against each other in a hyperspatial sea of colors and talking to each other in Japanese, Mandarin, and Russian. (queer as hayl, I know, but soo soo beautiful/hot) My one buddy sort of started it after we sniffed the 2c-b and he kept talking about how horny he was. This was a **VERY **erotic combination. Not overtly sexy in a stimulant kind of way at all. Like w0wzers. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) 


The MDAI alone was really quite nice, it felt like a MDA/MDMA comeup, very breathe-y with less body discomfort. My heart was pounding quite really hard, but wasn't sure if that was because of the drug or because of the sexual vibe of the party.  think I might have felt the MDAI more as I am on a daily piracetam regimen. 


2 hours into the experience we went to a club to watch another buddy spin a set for us. dancing was also nice, the visuals were fantastic. I kept getting this vertical bars of rainbow light zooming at me. Try this combo yourself and be amazed.

I experienced ZERO stimulation with the three batches of MDAI I have sampled. Felt good on the comeup, but without the dopamine "rocket to the face" of meph, it ranked a 4 out of 10 for me. Even with its short duration, methylone makes MDAI look bad. Different strokes I guess.

i've got a (heavy drinker) friend who prefer MDAI and won't take MDMA any more because MDMA+alcohol gets them into an 'embarrassingly wrecked'/half comatose state while MDAI+alcohol 'is just nice' apparently.  lots of love for Mindy.


some people complain that it just makes them want to curl up in a ball and relax and makes them feel like being antisocial, and i've experienced this myself, but i've found that if someone engages me in conversation then i snap out of it and get really into the conversation in an MDMA-like way.

Today I tried 100 mg MDAI + 160 mg Methylone and I was fairly impressed with it.  I took both before going skiing for the afternoon and it was quite awesome.  The experience wasn't that intense compared to some "rolls" I've had, but I didn't expect it to be, as I wanted to be able to ski safely.  I have to say it was probably the most fun I've had skiing in a while.  Flying down the mountain was quite a rush.  I did find that the cold dampened the feeling a little, but such is life.  I'd say it felt similar to around 120 mg of MDMA.  I was surprised to find that the comedown was extremely mild.  I hardly had any jaw clenching and it left me with a bit of an afterglow rather than a crappy comedown.  I was able to go to class eight hours after dosing and I was completely fine.  If I had taken MDMA instead, I know the comedown would have been worse.  This is definitely a good combo.  Next time, I'll raise the dosages a little and see how that is.

Personally, when I'm on MDAI, I always have an urge to socialize.  The lack of stimulation does make it easy to lie down and soak in the euphoria for a little bit though so I can see where you're coming from.  If I'm out doing something active, some stimulation is nice, but I find that MDAI is great for smaller social gatherings because you get most of the MDMA magic but you don't crash and can sleep without a problem.

MDAI up to 200mg seems quite tame.  (not necessarily bad) 


How often can you use it?


Do you lose the (subtle)  magic over time?


I was thinking of getting a hefty order at a better price, so is weekly use inadvisable?


Keeps me away from opiates.  Ilike kratom, but would not do that weekly.

I'm doing 125mg 3/4 times a month and have been for months on end. I find it good for sex and that's how often we get babysitting so we can really put the chandelier fixings to the test...


Yes, shallow but steady effects drop-off but I suppose that's serotonin receptor  downregulation for you  8)

Have so far resisted redosing or higher initial doses, did shift from oral to plugging a few weeks ago which gave it a bit of a *ahem* boot up the arse effects wise. 


I'm still having a bit of a love affair with this stuff but going to have to knock it on the head for a while or find something that will help to sort out the serotonin receptors. 

Don't yet fully know if Memantine is supposed to be able to help with that? More research needed there, might well be biting the wrong postman.

Just had a new batch delivered today, this is different to the stuff I had before. The MDAI I just finished was a very light tan colour and extremely crystalline, it was like it was made up of millions of little flakes of amber glass. It was good, very good and I thought it was pretty much pure from a vendor I trust.


This is from the same trusted vendor but obviously a different batch, it is crystalline, but a finely crystalline powder. The crystals are much finer, almost microscopic and it's *extremely*  fluffy, it's also just a shade off white, a very light cream colour. I have no Marquis but it's definitely MDAI, no question about that, it smells and tasted right when I did the allergy/identification stuff.


Just posting this so we can keep track of the batches really, there's still all sorts of shit flying around as MDAI and people still posting pics of dark brown grit and others saying all white MDAI is fake.

Hi all, first post here, nice forum indeed!


regarding the matter of what colour the MDAI has and the connection of how good it is seams to be totally irrelevant. The purity is not determined by what colour it is.

Many people seem to say the tan/brownish is the most pure and prefered colour but that's simply not the case.

The last batch I had, and this one were from that same vendor.


You might want to alter that quote a little as it'll easily pinpoint the vendor and the mods will probably alter it anyway..


The first lot of "MDAI" I ever bought was white and it was total shit, no activity in the slightest. I think it was actually benzocaine TBH as numbing was the only effect it had. This is definitely MDAI though, and although this obviously can't be used to gauge purity it tastes bloody strong! I'll find out if that is actually the case tomorrow night..


I'm guessing I'm one of the lucky ones, this stuff does hit me quite hard. I'd take good MDAI over the shit first press 6-ABP pellets I had any day of the week.

I also have a bit of this old brown MDAI kicking about that I bought it back in 2010 just after the meph ban.  Found similar effects to above and TBH haven't really cared for it and hardly touched the stuff to date - then I saw ur post & became curious as to whatever this brown stuff is.

So I got myself some more MDAI from someone I trus more - this time it's white and very sparkley.


So last weekend I experimented with the old brown, and this weekend with the new white.  Based on effects I'd say I'm sure they're different substances.  Now I recon that the old brown stuff could in fact be 2-AI or something along those lines because (bear with me here):


- Effects reminded me distinctly of some of the legal high pills I once had that were still legal after the ban - which said they contained 'aminoindane'.


- I then read some stuff up on 2-AI & its effects on erowid.


- The brown stuff smells distinctly different to mephedrone or my new MDAI in direct comparison.


- Personal experience comparing mephedrone, my new trusted MDAI, and this brown stuff, I'd say the key active in the brown stuff isn't likely to be MDAI or Meph.


So I've decided that it could be 2-AI - which has been lurking about in the shadier corners of rc-land for time, and I could imagine could easily be/have been in some of the dirty legal high pills being sold - BTW I'm not stupid enough to buy from that side these days.


In fact I'm going to treat what I've got as 2-AI - a buzzy stim with a shady, dark undercurrent and nasty crash potential - in a funny way not miles different from meph I suppose but a bit colder - not something I'd really reccomend anyhow.


So I'm now regarding the real MDAI as a pleasant find after all - Also I'm thinking it has potential to potentiate other substances maybe.

The stuff I've got is white and is quite pure as far as I can tell.  It looks like tons of little white crystals  and takes up more volume per weight than most other substances I've tried.  200 mg takes up more than half of a 00 gel cap.  I assume it's nearly pure because I seem to be getting better effects from it than a lot of other people on here with similar dosages.  Friends that have used it also thought it was great so it's not just me.  I wasn't expecting much when I bought it but I was blown away the first time I used it, and I have experience with MDMA to compare it to.


That being said, some people seem to also get great effects from tan MDAI so color doesn't seem to mean much.  From what I can gather from here, it seems newer batches are much better than the old ones, regardless of color.  That's not to say that all new stuff will be good or all the old stuff was bad, but vendors seem to generally be getting it together with this stuff.

Yeah fair point I was perhaps on a bit of a zealous tangent there...  Guess I'll just call it 'ambiguous-brownamine' and at least I have some idea of dosage/effects now.


And the newer stuff = definately worthwhile.

^ Don't you have the old stuff left? It would be great if you could perform blinded test: put two different powder in gelcaps and then pick random one. After having the experience you could open the one you left and see its color.

Looking for some advice on how to test something that claims to be MDAI. Are TheAzo's posts from [this thread](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=520088) still state of the art? I'm not confident that I can recognize the smell of cathinones (the M1 I've seen hasn't had a strong smell) but I do have Marquis, Simons, and Mecke reagents.

who the heck knows? Not only are we dealing with RCs, but most vendors are scumbags cutting your drugs with shit—if they're giving you a single molecule of the drug you're buying at all. Not to mention the lack of quality control in the industry.


I'll be able to answer your question in due time however ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)


For now, perhaps do research on other SSRAs:

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_releasing_agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_releasing_agent)


A few of the marketed SSRAs caused pulmonary hypertension and/or cardiac fibrosis with prolonged use. Though these were drugs made to be used daily, not weekly or biweekly.

In my report a few posts up, when I said tobacco made me feel a little uneasy and couch locked, I meant exactly what you describe here. I didn't feel antisocial so much. I didn't mind being with people, but I felt "stoned" like you would if you take a nicotine bong hit I would suppose (DO NOT try this!) I just wanted to lay down and not do anything, though talking came easy. This feeling wore off after 5-10 mins (probably went away along with the nicotine buzz?)


Like the other poster above, I also felt like if I was engaged in a convo, I would snap out of this daze and become chatty again. You also have to sort of force yourself to snap out of it by getting up and doing things.


This is somewhat similar to the somnolence I describe in my report above. I felt GREAT, but I just wanted to lay down. I get this on zoloft as well.. but again, if I can muster the mental energy to get up, I suddenly feel more energetic/chatty/upbeat.


I would assume coffee would help with this somewhat and alcohol, antihistamines, and other depressants would make it worse.


I'm interested in testing my MDAI's purity. Anyone know where I can send a sample to have it tested? preferably somewhere within the US.

For those taking a combo of m1 + MDAI:


Why are you ingesting both at the same time? m1 kicks in within 10-15 mins for me, and comes down at the 1-2hr mark. MDAI kicks in at 20-30 mins and lasts at least 5 hours. When dosing both together, what happens when the m1 wears off?


I pose this question because my friend in my report above came down from the MDAI much sooner than me, but he had also taken nearly twice the amount of m1 I took so that may be why (or perhaps it's not related to that at all.)


I would assume it would be best to take the MDAI, wait 30 mins and then take the m1. I'm talking about m1 doses of 200mg+, not 50-75mg boosters. I'll be trying this on the weekend.

Thanks to Killerd for your pennys worth, I havent research 2-AI so can't speak from experience. But I think, given that the dodgy brown MDAI appeared so soon after the Cathinone ban it IS possible that it's a mix of Meph & M1. This is still purely anecdoatal however. I didnt really like the original MDAI, but I DO like the new, white crystal. It's much more subtle, longer lasting & doesnt seem as "heavy". The comedown off the brown stuff is quite nasty ime

Like others have said, no one really knows.  I would also love to know the answer to this question.  However, based on my own experience, it seems like it can be used more often than MDMA.  This is just speculation, and should not be assumed as fact.  The closest I've ever spaced MDMA usage is 6 days and I felt like pure shit the day after the second roll and bad for a good 5 days afterward.  I've used MDAI two days in a row, and only felt a little tired and off the next day.  I've used it a week apart and it felt no different than it ever does.  I realize that brain damage could be happening without me feeling it, but with MDMA, there's no doubt your head will get fucked if you abuse it.  


I will say though that MDAI and a decent dose of adderall makes for a much worse comedown.  However, MDAI and methylphenidate feels much better the next day.  This makes sense since one study mentioned in this thread claimed that MDAI and a dopamine reuptake inhibitor creates little to no neurotoxicity.  And even though methylphenidate is kinda lame on it's own as a recreational drug, it goes quite well with MDAI.  The MDAI provides 95% of the fun, but the methylphenidate gives you that "get up and go" feeling that MDAI lacks on it's own.  I suspect a large dose of caffeine would work nearly as well.

Well, a fine white powder arrived, labeled as MDAI. This is how it tested with the DS kit:


Suspicious. This looks more like some kind of cathinone.

Yeah. I imagine they're dumping their old stock of mephedrone or whatever.

If you suspect it's a cathinone, it might be something good.  Start with a tiny 1 mg dose to make sure it isn't something crazy, then slowly work your way up until you get to a good dose of whatever it is.  If it's something shitty, you'll realize this before you take enough to have a really bad time.  If you go about it in an intelligent fashion, you can keep yourself safe and have some fun along the way.  Better than just flushing it.


Also, stuff like this could be why people have very different opinions on MDAI.  As a lot of us have assumed, we aren't all actually getting the real deal.  I should probably test the stuff I have just to be sure, but it acts the way MDAI is supposed to and it's damn fun regardless.

For the record, I want to say that my vendor is an industrial chemist who has the proper staff and equipment for synthesizing these RCs (he has been selling chemicals and supplies for years before getting into RCs), and based on my experience with his 2c*/m1 and other drugs compared to most vendors, I'd say his purity is top notch.


His MDAI is dark brown very much like coca baking powder (for making chocolate cake) or a brownie mix. He claims the purity at 98.9% and it's probably not that high but I wouldn't be surprised if it was. The fact that the chemical has a single consistency and very strong smell and taste (not a blend of flavors like tasting coke+baking soda) is also evidence leaning towards purity.


AFAIK the only "white MDAI" being sold online has tested positive for mephedrone and/or inorganic salts. zero MDAI.


I'm not a spectroscopist, and I know the color white symbolizes purity, but I feel there's no reason the drug should be white or clear. JWH-018 is white for instance, but 073 is very off-white. Same vendor. Based on a chemicals structure, it will absorb and reflect different wavelengths of light. Perhaps purer would be a bit lighter brown like the Erowid pic (though that could be the camera flash?)


I'm willing to send some in to get it tested so we can get some actual purity reports going. If you guys know a legitimate lab in the US where I can have this done, let me know.

How much Ritalin do you guys take per 100mg MDAI?


I'm thinking 5mg per 100mg MDAI is a good starting dose. I really don't want too much speediness and a crash (and the headaches ritalin gives me) but I feel ritalin is an excellent addition to the MDAI roll. Otherwise your pure MDAI 'rave' is a bunch of people sitting on the floor saying they feel fantastic but have no desire to move or do shit.

I've seen a video of MDAI running through the EZ Test kit, and the powder appeared tan/light brown, like Erowid's pic or the foam on a cup of hot cocoa. (Dark brown results from all 3 reagents.)

Well, that suspicion is mostly based on stories about shady UK vendors. The reaction doesn't really look like mephedrone, according to pics in  [this thread](http://bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?t=512598). Maybe naphyrone, or methedrone, or some weird combination of substances? Those all sound scary.

The stuff I get is white and it isn't mephedrone and it most certainly isn't inactive.  I don't have any of the normal testing reagents but I do have to pass drug tests that test for amphetamines.  All cathinones I've tried have failed.  The MDAI I buy passes.  It feels like MDMA without any stimulation.  That's all the evidence I have.  However, I have no reason to suspect it isn't MDAI.  Color doesn't seem to mean much of anything.  I've had JWH-250 come white, tan, and pink from the same vendor and it all acted exactly the same.  However, I'm not making the claim that all the white stuff is good.  My only recommendation is find a good vendor and stick with them.

I've only done this once but I found 36 mg of instant release methylphenidate to go well with 200 mg of MDAI.  I have no tolerance to either substance.  I would say that it was a good amount.  I was quite stimulated but I was able to sleep 6-7 hours after ingestion with the help of some JWH and two 25 mg diphenhydramine sleeping pills.  It was also a gradual comedown and not a hard crash.  


I agree that combining a stimulant with MDAI is almost necessary for any kind of active event.  I've tried MDPV, methylone, and methylphenidate.  Methylone was quite good in combination and so was methylphenidate.  MDPV crashed pretty bad, although I find MDPV to always do that.  Methylone probably feels the best of those three in combination with MDAI, but you also get neurotoxicity from mixing a dopamine releaser with MDAI according to a study people keep linking to.  It also fails my drug tests.  Methylphenidate works pretty well and you feel decent the next day.

So i've tried some newer mdai. But I'm not sure if its MDAI, as I took about 200mg to empty stomach and after 1h 30 min I felt only little come up. After I plugged 100mg it started almost instantly. Its very psychedelic and therapeutic. *snip* The first MDAI I had 4 months back came up in 30min and 200mg worked great. Also the first batch I had lasted only abouth 1h and this new one lasts 2hours. First dose 200mg orally and 2h later took 100mg plugged and lasted about 3h. This newer one is better, both are from different vendors. This newer one is even better.

How does MDAI feel when combined with MDPV? What can the high be compared to? Very MDMA-like? Mephedrone-like? Does it have high recreational value?


What about MDAI combined with dexedrine? (though I recognize the potential for neurotoxicity in this case)

I've combined MDAI with MDPV and it was decent.  I took 200 mg of MDAI and 10 mg of MDPV, both orally.  MDAI always seems better when combined with a stimulant.  However, MDPV is a pretty bad stimulant IMO.  To answer your questions, it is sort of MDMA-like.  I'd say the combo I took gave me 70% of what 150 mg of MDMA would have given me.  You feel happy, open, and stimulated, but there is something missing.  I've never used mephedrone so I can't compare it to that.  And yes, it definitely does have recreational value.  The problem is that MDPV crashes hard, so you'll have to deal with that.


However, MDPV is the worst stimulant I've combined with MDAI.  The best is probably methylone, but that will wear on your brain pretty hard so I wouldn't recommend doing it any more than you would use MDMA.  I've never combined it with Adderall, but friends have told me the combo is quite good, although the next day is rough.  I've combined 200 mg of MDAI with 36 mg of methylphenidate (Ritalin) and I thought it was far better than the MDPV combo.  I'm not going to say it was exactly like rolling, but if someone had given me 200 mg of MDAI and 36 mg of methylphenidate in a gel cap and told me it was MDMA, I probably wouldn't question it.  The crash wasn't bad either and I felt basically normal the next day.


The best combo I've had though is 200 mg of MDAI and 17 mg of 2C-I.  I'd recommend taking the MDAI an hour or two after the 2C-I.  On this combo, I felt absolutely awesome. I was very happy and social, and conversation flowed freely.  The visuals were also top notch.  I was tripping, but I could also easily hold a normal conversation (at least among high people) and basically just enjoy myself without worrying about being mindfucked.

Had my first try-out with MDAI today.

First, I snorted few mg just to test, if I'm allergic or something ... after ~30min I administered ~85mg rectally.

I didn't recognize any noteworthy effects.


The MDAI I got is pearly-white, super-fluffy and extremely soluable in water.


Isn't the rectal one a ROA that works for MDAI? The small amount I snorted lets me think, that insufflation isn't an option either ^^ Is the oral one the way to go?

Anybody tried to vaporize that stuff?

I was very happy and social, and conversation flowed freely.  The visuals were also top notch.  I was tripping, but I could also easily hold a normal conversation (at least among high people) and basically just enjoy myself without worrying about being mindfucked.

interesting perspective. i usually abstain from mixing chems that have this mcuh of a difference in duration (2ci is a long trip for me, while mdai is 3h max). could you maybe compare it to a normal 2ci trip experience at the same level for you? so as to show what the mdai brought?

it is usually considered safer to test for allegies by oral dosing (also because most chems are more effective snorted and so negative effects are worse if something is to go wrong)


dont have much exp with rectal, but a lot of this thread tells of oral dosing, so im thinking why would you not try that first? it is the most tried one..... vaping doesnt work iirc.

Yeah, it was a really small amount of fluffy stuff, not even a mg ... but, of course, you're right; it's better to be done oraly.


Don't know why i tried rectal first. Was just kind of a instinct because imo mdma is soo much better in all aspects by this ROA. Maybe i try it again sometime else but at this time, i will use a bit more of water as is needed, to bring it in solution ... wasn't that comfortable ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You're in luck.  I had used the exact same dose of 2C-I a few days before I tried the combo.  Through out the experience, I was taking mental notes of the differences.  Regarding the difference in duration, I would recommend taking the MDAI a few hours after the 2C-I so they end at about the same time.  MDAI tends to last 4-6 hours for me and 2C-I lasts 7-9 hours in my experience.  When I did the combo, I took both at the same time and had a decent amount of trip left over once the MDAI wore off.  It wasn't bad though.    


Anyway, the differences between the combo and 2C-I alone.  Both were done with my group of friends, some of whom were using the same drugs as me:  


Adding MDAI made it a much more social experience.  Talking was easy and natural.  When I was on just 2C-I, conversation was doable but kinda awkward.  I would start sentences and then trail off.  With the MDAI, I was talking a mile a minute, as I usually end up doing with serotonin releasing drugs.  Along the same lines, the combo brought what I call the "hug effect" on the people using it.  Like, it makes you go around asking for hugs and you start complementing everyone in the room.  Ya know, that wussy empathogen feeling that we all seem to love so much ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Also, has anyone tried storing MDAI in solution?  Does it even dissolve in water?  I've never tried because I'm afraid of wasting it.  However, I've come to realize that an open bottle of "water" looks a lot less sketchy than a bag of white powder and that a shot glass is less sketchy than a scale.  I know that some drugs will last in water and others will not.  Has anyone tried liquid measuring with MDAI?  I only need it to last a week.

Well, I got my money back after being scammed (yay credit cards) and obtained a sample from a more reputable source. This stuff is light tan and ridiculously fluffy - 100mg fills up almost half of a 00 gelcap. Marquis turns dark red, Mecke turns greenish-brown like baby poop, Simons has no reaction.


It mostly dissolves in water, but there were some bits that didn't dissolve.


The effect from 100mg was as expected. Kind of a mellow roll. Music was enhanced, appetite wasn't affected, eyes felt like they wanted to wiggle. Seems like this could be a decent alternative to alcohol for social occasions.


At T+3:00, adding 180mg of methylone didn't produce anything beyond the normal methylone experience. Nor did adding 50mg MDAI with the 50mg methylone redoses. I guess to evaluate this combo I'd need to take the initial doses at the same time, and maybe a higher dose of MDAI? Will give it a shot sometime, but given the safety concerns it might even be a relief if the combo fails to impress.

Hey guys, just registered to post in this thread! I purchased 1g of MDAI expecting it to be fairly mediocre, it consisted of a very white, fluffy and (highly) water soluble powder. I tried 150mg first and was surprised by the rush it gave me when i started coming up (about 35 mins after oral ingestion, in a glass of water, it didn't taste so bad), the high lasted about 2 hours and the come down was very mild.


The next day I was smoking some pretty decent weed all day and decided I'd mix it up with 200mg of MDAI (more than the previous day in case of tolerance), it hit in 30 mins and WOW what a buzz! I was far more sociable than with the 150mg on its own and i was getting pretty nice OEV's (I watched my black and white tiles on the bathroom floor merge into one another). The high seemed to last about an hour longer too, but it was hard to tell because i was so stoned too!


Anyways, it was good stuff and I think/hope it was MDAI.

I hated the thought to start with but now I'm a convert, if it's pluggable chances are I'll plug it. All my MDAI gets shoved where the sun don't shine as I find it comes on faster and hits harder that way, also means I don't have to starve myself first which makes up for the unpleasantness of the act itself.


It should work fine by this route..

Anyone else experience substantial heartburn and stomach ache after MDAI use? It probably has the most irritable effect on my stomach I've ever encountered. Even after eating a gram of MDMA my stomach isn't half as upset.

Trying to find pictures/information on how MDAI should look like. Some claims it's supposed to be entirely white, but the concensus from the 6-7 posts I've found generally seems to claim it's brown. 

Haven't tried mine out yet, but it's incredibly white and crystally... Much more crystally than other substances I've seen (I got MXE, 4-ho-dpt, 4-AcO-DMT and 5-meo-mipt etc to compare irl at the moment). Pretty big crystals too, about 1mm in length, 0.4mm in width.


Here's a picture of mine (with a hairband as some kind of bad size-indicator):

[http://i.imgur.com/L0BIm.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/L0BIm.jpg)


Of the little I've tastes (1-2mg) it seems to taste very little, chemical taste (bit it might be some other substance I've come in contact with earlier making it). Tastes way less than 4-ho-met. Smells absolutely nothing (although I do have a slight cold). Anyone seen similar MDAI who could tell me about potency (never tried MDAI or MDMA earlier)? Should 100-150 be an okay newbie-dose for someone weighing about 55 kilos, 163cm in height? If not I'll come back with a reply on Sunday/Monday, although I can't compare to anything similar..

That's exactly what the MDAI I have looks like.  Color can vary a lot, as it only takes a very small amount of impurities to change the color.  150 mg would probably be a good dose to start with.  I usually take 200 mg but I'm 145 pounds and 5'11" (65 kg and 180 cm).

Jesus Christ this has a horrific comedown. First time I did it I got no brain zaps, no hangover and no crash over the next few days. Waited a few weeks, did it again. But I took too much. I had no zaps or comedown at first, then on day 3 (today) I crashed...hard.

That's what I'm wondering.  One thing I've always liked about MDAI is that there is little to no hangover.  I've never had more than like 210 mg though.

I had a good experience taking this in combination with MPA which I posted over in that thread: 

[http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=9571194&postcount=475](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=9571194&postcount=475)

Basically I took 200mg MDAI orally then insufflated 30mg MPA after the MDAI kicked in. As expected the MPA provided the stimulation lacking in the MDAI and the MDAI provided the serotonin glow that the MPA lacks.

it is not a common effect of this chemical as far as i know, however there might be other factors involved. try to eat well, excersize a little, go for a walk in fresh air, or socialize a bit... maybe it is just a phase?


(im a little down and gloomy now too, though it has more to do with work starting tomorrow ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay, im starting to feel a little better. I always eat very healthy and exercise daily - a little bad mood is no excuse in my opinion.


Im going to try a bigger dose saturday - About 180mg. The problem is there is a big party at friday and maybe there would be some alcohol involved. Could i drink without "burning off" my body when im gonna take MDAI the next day? (In the afternoon out in the forrest - just chilling)

well there are some things to consider. for instance, it is not really advised to take these sort of rcs too often, even milder ones like mdai. 

alcohol might just tire you and give you more of a negative mood for your trip the next day, but only if you binge and get pissdrunk. if you keep things within limits, drink responsibly and rest properly, i dont think you will have any troubles.

keep in mind that 80mg is a different experience than 180mg. maybe read up a bit what others experience and be prepared

I've read alot about it and many trip reports. After this experience with 180mg i will put the rest of the mdai away for several months.


I will drink i moderation ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png). Thanks for your help.

BTW. i forgot to ask, we are going to combine it with cannabis because we want the psychedelic aspect enchanted - Ofcourse we will we careful with it. I've read that cannabis is very potent on MDMA. Do you think it would work the same way with MDAI?

I'm surprised at the high doses people are listing here. I've had MDAI a few times in the past - the first time I had 70mg + some MPA, which hit me very hard and was very enjoyable, the next week I tried 100mg of MDAI and was left feeling sweaty and shaky with no pleasant effects. I couldn't imagine trying more than that...


I'm going to try the MPA/MDAI combination once again tonight, hopefully it treats me well. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

@oSpherical. I think that batches of MDAI can vary a lot in strength and also it can affect you differently on different occasions. A year or so ago, when all the stock was tan or brown, and presumably impure,  I could get effects from 100mg when I combined it with the usual suspect stims. Now that the stock all seems to be white I find 200mg is necessary (I have tested this stock with various reagents and it appears to be the real deal). Please let us know how your combo goes tonight and most of all enjoy it!

Aye, 70mg has done nothing for me tonight except heat up my body, very different to the only batch I've tried in the past.


Just bombed another 80mg and am hoping that tonight isn't a total waste.

if you have the white 'sparkly' stuff 150 to 100mg should work with a 50mg line of MPA thrown in after 30 minutes or so. Goodluck!

Seems like a fun drug. One of my sources currently carries batches of these babies and I plan on ordering some. Are the effects similar to MDMA and MDA rather than methylone? I have heard good and bad things about methylone so I'm hoping for an enchanted experience like MDMA maybe with a more psychedelic effect like MDA.

MDAI really isn't like MDMA or MDA at all.  MDAI is a selective serotonin releaser, whereas MDA, MDMA, etc are releasers/reuptake inhibitors of 5-HT, DA & NE, plus there's a little 5-HT2a agonism thrown in there as well, which certainly adds a dimension.

Sounds awful friend, hope you've bounced back 100% by now!


Do you think any other things couldve contributed to the "crash"? For instance, do you have a healthy diet? Do you smoke fags, weed, or do you drink heavilly? What was going on in your life, was there anything that coulda caused increased depression?


Whatever the other causal affects, it could simply be that MDAI does not agree with you. IF you do take it again, go very easy. I'm very light & sensitive to pretty much everything & I can get a good few hours outta a measely 30mg of this compound.

Welcome to bluelight and thank you so much for that information. My MDAI is pretty dirty as well actually, it's cocoa brown. I'd be interested to know if the impurities seem to cause anything themselves but then have to evaluate if I want to try it.

i too have had white mdai and brown mdai. there was also a batch of very dark coffe ground mdai i tried only once and gave me what i can only liken to acute stomach pain similar to an ulcer. luckly it wasnt the case and i binned that one. 

as far as the white and brown powders, id say the brown one is less potent (~70% perhaps), but the impurities dont seem to affect the experience. 


also, ive had an experience with mdai after a preious night's outing on 6apb, and can say it had a lot to suffer. i still got osme effect from it, but to a much much lesser extent. it wasnt a complete loss, and some tolerance was expected, but the emptyness of the experience was quite surprizing.

nature is telling me to slow down i think

I concur with that.


Took around 150mg of MDAI, followed by another 120mg about 30 minutes later. Just as I started to feel warm and fuzzy I insnufflated ~30mg of MPA.


I feel great and I'm almost gurning a little. Just like a big warm hug with some nice clean stimulation. It's not MDMA but surprisngly good :D Taken weak pills in the past which have done less for me!

I've been using MDAI for a little while now and I've noticed something that most people don't seem to mention on here.  When I'm going to bed after a night on MDAI, I get very vivid hallucinations when I have my eyes closed.  I'm not talking about patterns and fractals, but a full blown dream-like state.  Sometimes the hallucinations are rather abstract, like floating through space, and other times it's more realistic, like sitting in a room talking with friends.  It's basically like I'm dreaming, except I can control most of it.  Also, as soon as I open my eyes, everything is completely normal and I'm back in my room with no visuals or anything.  It basically lets my imagination run wild.  


This happens to me pretty much every time.  Other people that have used it with me have noticed this too, at least to some extent.  Has anyone else noticed this?  For reference, I usually use around 200 mg and end up going to sleep around 5-6 hours after ingestion.

180mg MDAI (white) taken three hours into a 40mg dose of aMT gave me an excellent day a while back!  Once the MDAI kicked in the rolling feeling of the aMT increased dramatically and felt even more peaceful than before.  


MDAI did nothing for me by itself though.  Without combining it with something it seems pretty redundant.  Once I have tried all the new psyches I have around I will look into combinations with them ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey guys, got company round so dont have time to do much research on this.  Ordered some MXE last weekend and picked up a gram of MDAI aswell cos it was only 15 quid for a gram.


Anyway I'm considering doing some tonight, looks like slightly off white powder.  Basically what you recommend for the dose and method of ingestion.  Been drinking vodka aswell.  Experienced in the drug taking dept.


Quick bit of help here would be much appreciated.

Well, a full recreational dose seems to be around 130-230 mg on average, although potency varies so be careful.  I personally take 200 mg.  It seems to go quite well with alcohol, although I wouldn't recommend being completely drunk as the alcohol might overpower the MDAI at that point.  Most people take MDAI orally.  Since it doesn't release dopamine, there isn't much of a rush to it which makes shooting it or snorting it fairly pointless.  Also, wait at least 90 minutes before deciding that you didn't take enough.  It takes a while to come up and it kinda creeps up on you.

I wouldn't mix them if I were you.  There have been reports of people saying the combo is unpleasant.  Also, someone supposedly died with the combo, although they IVed both drugs and used 400 mg of MDAI and 100 mg of MXE, both heroic doses.  MDAI mixes good with a lot of things, but MXE seems not to be one of them.

i think you ll distinguish it by the shorter duration, and a bit worse comedown actually. but that is just my experience mixing them, and ive had only impure mdai to test this with, unfortunately.

Agreed. I also found a mix of 120mg mdai + 60mg 4-mmc + 60mg M1 to be pretty indistinguishable from a 120mg dose of mdma. I really wasn't expecting so much from such relatively small doses but the synergy was fantastic. Pity I discovered it just before two of the ingredients got so rudely removed from the market.

Tried both the tan powder and the white. Got absolutely no effect from either of them other than mild nausea and a headache.

given the finding mentioned in the report posted over in EADD [http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=9652845&postcount=55](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=9652845&postcount=55) I'd be dubious of any of the "white" mdai personally.  though admittedly they were gotten a while back I see no real reason to suspect that it's changed at all.

I have several batches of MDAI and the only one that is really good is a white powder, whiter than snow with tiny crystals in it. The rest I have are all brown and are definately not as good. I require far higher doses with the brown ones and it doesn't feel as clear. I have never had any bad comedown from MDAI, actually the opposite, I feel happier the day(s) after.

Ketamine with MDAI is highly recommended. After using just small amounts after big lines it gives much more depth to the high. 


Recomended +++


Also when the effects of ketamine wears of the high of the MDAI is everlasting even onto the next day slightly from my experience.

I think an easy way to analyze your MDAI is to dissolve some in water and see what color it turns.  If it doesn't turn some shade of yellow then it probably doesn't have iodine in it and thus probably isn't MDAI.

I would be careful with this.  MDAI reportedly doesn't mix well with methoxetamine, which is fairly similar to ketamine.  Someone even died on that combo, although they IVed huge doses of each.  Ketamine is a different drug though, so it might work better.  Just don't dive in with large doses of each before you know how you will react.

There is no iodine in mdai. It is 5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-aminoindane.

first post on this forum, and quite a newbie to drugs in general only really tried coke an weed before


anyway, was in a house party last month an bought a gram to myself, must have had 600mg and a few friends had the rest, was white powder, not sure on its purity. was also drinking throughout the night, must have had about 10 500ml 4% lager cans, not sure how many units that is.


was snorting it all night probably in around 80-100mg lines, felt a good buzz, happy and liked to have a chat, wasn't going crazy dancing or anythin if anything felt more laid back.


pupils were severly dilated as everybody was pointing this out to me ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

thats a pretty green question there ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) but if youve read a bit back through this thread, you might have seen the preferred and most used way to take mdai is oral, parachuted. im actually surprized you got that much out of a 50mg line. 


may i suggest reading a a bit back through this thread, and maybe some TR, and try oral ROA next time? i prefer it like that, though you mihgt find the effect a bit mild (this really depends on people)


best of luck

oh sorry i will. an i meant to say i felt happier on this mdai that ive got rather than the one i bought of some guy at the house party, not that the effects were greater from a 50mg line than 600mg ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I think I have MDAI figured out and please raise your hands if you agree with trip on this one.MDAI works like MDMA .I know there dfrent drugs but have you ever ate an x pill that you know was damn good but didn't get high from it at all cause you were in a bad vibe or as it goes *not blown up?* Then it's  a waste of the drug.


Thats exactlly how MDAI works.I can eat 300+mg's of it and an hour later not feel anything.Turn my subwoofers up with some bangin ass trance and BAM! Magic baby! eye wobles ,sweating ,jaw clenching.

Thats why you get such mixed reviews for it.People say it's worthless or it's fucking great..I know MDMA is the king but,MDAI with the help of methylone or any type of mild stim would definatlly give MDMA a run for it's money.


Everytime trip orders MDAI he always chooses the white and everytime it has a lite tan color to it.


Any of you MDAI lovers out there agree with trip about having to "Blow up" to unleash the magic ???  Please raise your hands![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've visited ecstasydata.org and typed "MDAI" in the search field. Here is [the results](http://www.ecstasydata.org/results.php?start=0&search_field=all&s=MDAI).


So there is the evidence that some MDAI on the market is fake.

Of course, people tend to invest $120 in testing when they suspect that their sample is impure/mislabeled, but [the results for Methylone](http://www.ecstasydata.org/results.php?start=0&search_field=all&s=Methylone) are much more consistent.

I have passed both dip stick tests and lab tests on probation with MDAI in my system.  That's odd that it would fail for meth, since it isn't even an amphetamine.  You might want to try using a higher quality drug test.  Even the good ones fail for no reason sometimes.

i'd venture a guess that its more likely a cathinone or amphetamine that has been misrepresented, or perhaps an MDAI MPA type mixture... sketchy rc vendors...

Tried this last night, parachuted 150mg followed by 120mg and hour later.  REALLY subtle, I was surprised when people said how much of a push this lacked...but unfortunately it's true.  


Definitely an empathogen but was really lacking in the euphoria area.  At one point in the night I was becoming a little anxious maybe just out of frustration that the experience was so bland.  A blunt and a balloon of nitrous was a nice addition but nothing like smoking cannabis on MXE.  


Didn't experience any increase in music appreciation until the Jack Herrer was getting smoked.


Not something I'm going to try again any time soon.

I was nervous before I first tried this, because of the mixed reviews. It was the tan colored powder from a European source. I must say I am very pleased with the results. And if your into porn, magic happens. Now I can't wait to try this with my wife.

Its a nice chemical, MDAI. Subtle, but very nice. Good thing for quiet-ish nights out rather than full on raves.


Can't wait to try some of this with MPA - something tells me that would be a pretty lush combination.

OK so I discovered that my brown MDAI has safrole as an impurity in it, how much? who knows? I do know that safrole is a carcinogen although a mild one, no idea what kind of damage you could expect a certain amount of it to have. The pretty high doses of MDAI itself that are needed do not help though.


I was going to supply a photo, but that would be tantamount to having an ID thread.

My batch is brown as well and I do not find it to be that pure since my dosage had to be so high.  How did you know the impurity was safrole?

I got it from a guy who got it tested. That can be done for free and anonymously in our country. I have been told the analysis methods are GC/MS and or GC/LCDAD, if it is really important they can NMR it but they normally don't do that. I do know the lab that does this right now is part of a huge chemical concern, certainly one of the biggest in the country. This same friend has also gotten DOC and DOM tested a few times now, he got burned a few times with those.

I have ~880 mg of MDAI that I've been keeping in storage for about a year.

I got the gram a year ago, but I haven't been too eager to try it. It's dark brown, like cocoa powder. My friend tried a dose of it and reported a pretty mild effect (and that's saying something, b/c she's VERY sensitive to drugs)


I tried tan-colored MDAI wayy back. It was actually the first thing I ever tried. It would be worth taking again, but I won't bother with this impure stuff. I have high tolerance anyway.


I remember hearing you can do a heptane wash? I haven't been able to find any info on how one would go about this.

I'm pretty sure the batch I received was impure, it was the cocoa brown looking variety I might add.


My reagents all matched up except Simons which gave me a dilute reddish/brown reaction after a few minutes.  I have no idea if that is relevant but MDAI is supposed to be negative to Simons.

I posted a bit back about preferring MDAI to the shit first press 6-ABP pellets, which at the time I did. Umm, did 125mg of recent 6-ABP powder at the weekend and now feel a bit silly ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)

Ugh. Decided to do MDAI and MPA tonight but didn't have enough MPA to last me an hour.

MDAI is so boring alone... it has a nice feeling to it, but a boring one. The sort where you alternate between tasks every minute trying to pass time.

I do know that safrole is a carcinogen although a mild one, no idea what kind of damage you could expect a certain amount of it to have. The pretty high doses of MDAI itself that are needed do not help though.

I have 4 batches (well I don't know if they are different batches to be honest, but bought at 4 different times) of MDAI. 3 of the batches are bought ffrom the same country, all are brown while the other batch is white and bought from another country than the brown ones. There is a huge difference in them. The white one works like a charm with approx. 200 mg. The brown ones don't. I have to take much higher doses of them and I still don't get the same feeling, they just don't seem as clear.


Unfortunately I have no chance of testing them, but I am 100 % sure the brown MDAI one in my case must have impurities, since it works so poorly. Thankfully I only have a gram of that one and 5 grams of the white one (which I'm not able to get anywhere anymore...). If there is a risk of safrole impurity, I'll think I just stay with the white MDAI I have.


BTW, is it allowed to post photos of compunds?

I really dislike MDAI.  Its been almost 3 weeks and I still have a dumb SSRI feeling from it. No other drugs have been consumed since.  Falling asleep has been difficult....sleepiness and low motivation are also present. Hope this clears up at the 30 day mark. I should also mention starting the flow of urine takes 3x as long as normal to piss.  Will never be consuming this drug again.

short answer: dont.


longer answer:

just dont do it. really. especially with unknown chems from unknown batches coming from potentially unknown suppliers.

i do think there are some reports of it being used this way though, but for the greener people i just dont think it is worth it.


also, regarding the dizzyness that some report, this being a research chemical, all things should be considered possible until proven otherwise. but like said before, make sure it is the chem and at the right purity before liking it directly. however, warning like this should be expressed when one suspects them


however i find it a bit off that the dizzy spell is related appearing 1 week later. iirc mdai doesnt normally stay that long in the body and neither do its metabolites.

I'd totally forgotten about my limited experience of MDAI until I stumbled on this thread: found it very disappointing and unexciting (apart from one occasion when I drove into Birmingham and took some half an hour before I arrived, expecting nothing very much - and found I came up surprisingly hard as I entered the city!!). No problems driving, but I did have to concentrate hard - LOL. But the other three or four times I tried it - meh, really. Haven't been tempted back to it since.

You're right, Solipsis. But the two occasions before that that I actually experienced something from it, it took well over an hour to even start having an effect, so I took it half an hour before arriving - and for some reason it kicked in much, much earlier. Not a mistake I'll make again.

There is a lot of sketchy stuff that is sold as MDAI.  If you find a reliable vendor, I'd suggest to keep using it even if you supposedly find it cheaper somewhere else.  Real MDAI shouldn't cause some of these really messed up reactions some people are reporting.  While everyone can react differently to drugs, my friends and I have been using legit stuff for a while, and the only negative effects some people have (in my observation) is mild depression the day after use.  I've never experienced any negative physical effects, and to my knowledge, no one that has used legit MDAI that I personally know has either.  But I guess anything is possible.

After doing some reading online I ordered a gram of mdai from what seems to be a legit vendor. We can see why they call it sparkle; it was a white crystalline substance with small chunks to break up and shined in the light like miniscule glitter almost, like a pearlescent sheen. Both my fiancé and I were surprised at the intensity of it. We both took 225mg, with 150mg taken orally and and additional 75 insuffulated as well as burned some kratom to give us a familiar feeling with the new. The combination was excellent, and now that we know what to expect we will likely try it alone and let it peak before we burn our Kratom next time. It took over 2 hours before the effects of the MDAI peaked. I was blown away by the intensity of it. I wasn't expecting it to be as psychedelic as it was. Both if us thought it was a lot like shrooms but without the visuals. It didn't have crazy euphoria, but was more like extreme contentment with elements of excitement. The peak lasted about 6 hours with an additional 12 hours of comedown. The comedown was nothing compared to ecstasy or meth, and didn't have the same odd comedown misery that strong devil's acid gives you. The comedown was slow and pleasant. Definitely something that I'll try again. And we HIGHLY recommend going to see a 3D movie on it.

peak of 6 hours? additional 12 h of comedown?? these are very odd numbers for this chemical, meaning it usually lasts much less. it might have been the kratom perhaps, but it rarely leaves people with this kind of reaction, even in higher doses... glad it worked for you, but are you sure it was only mdai in there?


(as a side note, whats devil's acid?)

IDK, MDAI usually lasts like 5-6 hours for me.  I sometimes take it with kratom, but not always.  I wouldn't say I peak for that long, but even six hours in, I still will feel pretty damn good.  As far as a 12 hour comedown, I will get after effects for about that long, but they aren't particularly pleasant.  I'd consider it more of a mild hangover.

Our day-after feeling is one of extreme laziness and contentment (we took a 5 hour nap when it's usually only 2ish) and have just been feeling really relaxed. It most certainly feels like we "partied" last night. 24 hours after the peak we still have some lingering effects, primarily the lethargy. We're gonna either get a test kit and see what's in it or send it off and have it tested. We'll post our results once we get them.

I've got 2 grams of this coming, will be interesting to trial it. I've had the Sparkle research pellets before, and they were very nice, but would be good to properly trial the powder. Hopefully all the dodgy batches are not around anymore, and I get the genuine product. I feel theres quite some potential in this chemical, especially in a combination with MPA/possibly aMT.

i'v used mdai twice now first at 250mg and secondly 330mg (2x ~165mg with approx a 2 hour gap)


while this obviously inst as good as mdma i find it feels alot more natural and combined with caffiene it makes for a really good club drug.


the thing i love about mdai is that it gives me the best afterglows at a time where i dont really get them anymore from mdma.

**MDAI first and second experience**


Fist of all, I begin apologising  for my bad english.. I hope my small contribution can be useful to this threat.


/* SUMMARY*/


I've purchased 1gr of white MDAI, which was analysed using Thin Layer Chromatography and GC/MS, showing the material purchased was realy MDAI, without any product synthesis but with some little diluent. 


Here is the summary of the experience; I've written details below for those interested. 


I've taken 50 mg as a 'treshold test', and 100+50mg one month later. I get a ill-defined experience, with very little empathy buy with some interesting introspection. Not enjoyable, but maybe interesting. I've got the feeling a better setting (for instance, a social one) would make a big diference. I think that some alcohol (2-3 beers) combines well. Clearly, there is a lack of being 'pushed' in a stimulant/warm/euphoric manner and definitely, in my opinion that substance can't be classified as close to MDMA, despite some aspects may be similar. Further research is required. 


Has anyone mixed it with 2c-b or MDMA?


/*  REPORT */


The subject of this report is spanish 20 years old male, 65 kg. Good health, without mental disorders. History of consumption to highling in relation to this report are: alcohol (< 140 gr per week), opiates 3-4 times/month during last 4 years (codeine, tramadol or opium), speed 1-3 times per month,  MDMA 8 times/year, 2C-B 7 times/year.


FIRST TRY (treshold trial)


50 mg : mild wellness and serenity, beggining one hour after shallowing the material. Placebo? No disgusting effects noted. Seems a promising substance. 


SECOND TRY


Have taken aprox 30 mg anfetamine and 240 mg of MDMA 9 days ago (this could be relevant). One month has passed between this trial and the las one. I'd like to highlight I had'nt unrealistic expectations placed on this substance, nor do I expect something very close to MDMA. 


100 mg (18:15) Baseline FC: 93 bpm. Feeling good. 


+00:45 mild restlessness


+01:30 sedation, mild buzz. Remains some concern, manifested as light physical disconfort, similar to that I've experienced my fisrt two or three times on 2C-B low dosages. 


+02:00 Redosing 50 mg. FC: 90 bpm. 


+02:15 Sedation increasing. 


+03:00 Taking a glass of wine. Maybe set&setting aren't adequate: I'm alone at home. Feeling of insatisfaction. Yawning every 5 minutes, feeling tired/bored. 


+03:15 I take a book (Invisible, Paul Auster) and go for a walk, feeling the need to go towards my ex-girlfriend house. Lights of the streets are MDMA-like. I smoke a cigarrette, have a sit on a bench, and finish reading my book drinking a can of beer. Not so many difficulties on focusing. I get some introspective feelings, mainly looking at my past romantic relationships. 


+05:00 Back at home. I decide to smoke some opium (400 mg), trying to achieve the experience in a more pleasant mood.

I've done quite a bit of MDAI and feel it has run its course with me, and probably won't buy it again. Sure, it has a nice feeling for a time when you come up off it, but it is quite one dimensional. I presume partly due to it only releasing serotonin and no dopamine. To me it isn't as good as methylone ever was and is also inferior to MDMA. It's only real plus point is its cheapness and availability which was useful for a time after the cathinone ban. For occasional mash ups I also find 6-APB better in almost every way.

It adds some much needed serotonin to compounds like 4-fa and M1 in combo. As a solo drug it's fairly one-dimensional but I figured people would have given up using it as a solo drug already.

I bought 5g (the white stuff, >90% purity claimed), felt like the real thing based on previous experiences, and polished off the whole lot in about a week. Now I feel like utter shit. Guess I'm getting mine eh.

5g a week? That's insane. MDAI usually gives me one good experience at 200mg or so (with MPA), and then subsequent doses just cause discomfort unless I wait over two weeks to dose. 5g in a week is insane. I'd imagine you're going to experience some harsh brain zaps.

Last few times I've done this chemical, I've had very little effect. Its the white, crystalline batch. Its a shame, because I have had fairly decent effects on it in the past.

Christ yes, I barely slept last night and I don't think I would've slept at all if the selfless girlfriend hadn't come round to clean up my mess. I had some serious depression/anxiety going on too (still some remainder today). Yesterday I didn't touch it, even when I realised what I **should've** done is tapered off with the left over ~400mg. I don't know why I carried on cold turkey but I didn't feel inclined to bomb anymore of something that had already fucked me up (strong aversive effect -- I very nearly chucked it away, fortunately I didn't). Today I did 80mg when I woke up to stop the zaps and then came down to another 50 as the day went on (definitely not in any hope of recreational effects, I should add!) so that I can finally put it to bed by tomorrow for my weekend in Brussels.


I'm posting mainly as a cautionary tale to all who might misinterpret the "safe" label of MDAI as "all you can eat" and also to vent at my own stupidity a little bit. If you do somehow end up on a bit of a bender with this stuff, don't just stop, plan ahead to cut down with the last x mg. I wouldn't wish my yesterday on anyone. 8(


A good drug when done right. I will be treating it (and everything else, I daresay) with a lot more respect from now on. Although as soon as I've passed the withdrawal, I don't think I'll be able to justify - or want to justify - using it again.

I wrote a trip report the day after I first tried mdai about 2 months ago but it was accidentally deleted and I couldn't be asked to rewrite it. Anyway here's a condenced version, the stuff I got was a white powder, ever so slightly sparkly. The three of us (myself D and J for the purposes of the story) had 150mg each, after about half an hour I got hit with a sudden rush of warmth and slight euphoria that disappeared quickly however I'm sure it wasn't placebo because it quite intense similar to when mdma hits you but weaker. There was a subtle change in mood that I wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't known I was on something (subtle in the same way 10mg of ritalin makes you noticeably more talkative to other people, but not to yourself). At 1 hour we each took 100mg more and then at 2 we took another 130 more. I felt no difference after each dose but after the second one we did smoke some high quality weed, so that may have overpowered it. All I can say is for that entire night I was not sober, but I can not describe how.


There was a lot of time dilation, 5 minutes of chasing a moth round the boat we were on felt like an hour or so (Surely that must be a sign we weren't sober?). One friend of mine J who'd also had two beers, but smoked less weed than us started properly hallucinating after the second dose. At one point he was standing behind my other friend D and he reached out and grabbed at the air behind his head. I asked him what he was doing and he said he thought that D was wearing an old fashion night cap with a bobble and he tried to grab it. Throughout the night he kept saying he kept seeing us wearing different things, from an american football helmets to penguin costumes. He also was terrified of the dark and claimed that anything that was in the dark disappeared from his reality and he couldn't remember or imagine what was there (We were on an old house boat without any lights, we only had a torch). At about 2am (we had started dosing at about.... 8? Fuck it was a while ago) we were sat down on a the couch and the conversation fell into a lull, we suddenly realised it was light outside and it was 5am, but we all thought we were silent for a minute or two. 


We decided to try and get some sleep. It was restless and none of us thought we had fallen asleep but each of us had seen the others sleeping and D had snored for a bit. It seems we all had a restless sleep and kept waking up often. The day after dissapeared, I can't remember much of it other than sitting on a wall outside the local cornershop in silence with D and J. I got home at about 6pm and fell asleep striaght away I slept till 8am the next day and still felt tired when I woke up. J says he slept for about 16 hours that night. Overall the day after felt similar to the day after I had my biggest dose of mdma (150mg eyeballed, I have scales now) only it lacked the zoned happy feeling, but on the bright side I didn't get an bouts of midweek depression as I do with mdma.


Will try a dose of about 250mg within the next two weeks without weed and without redosing and see how I feel. Do people think what I got was actually mdai? Has anyone tried it with alcohol, I can imagine it being quite a nice mood enhancer and it seemed to have mild stimulant effect, since none of us were particularly sleepy at any point.


I also want to try the mdai + ritalin combo, any advice on ratios?

Just thought I'd throw my 2 pence in on this compound. I got a gram of white powder, which is very sparkly u der light. Anyway decided I would start with a small dab under the tongue for allergy purposes. Went to the shop an bought some beeers all was fine. Got back an did 2 or 3 more dabs under the tongue while chatting to my mate via text. Drank some beeers and bombed probably 50mg... after 20 mins started to feel warm and noticed music appreciation was elevated. Smoked a rollie and felt a sort of not so nice rush and a lot of mind chatter thinking oh no this is going to be horrible (I have awful anxiety issues thanks to weed which I no longer smoke as a result? That passed and continued to do small dabs every 10 to 20 minutes, feeling slightly better with each one but still struggling to feel a direct "fuckedness" after 4 more beers and probably 5 more dabs I find myself at a lovely chilled state. No pupil dilation as yet as I suspect my total dosage to still be less than 100mg (thanks anxiety) but definitely starting to feel like I'm in a nice little bubble. No rushing but just a nice glow. Definitely not what I was expectibg but then again from what I read I expected the unexpected if that makes sense. Anyway aftercall these tiny increms I find myself at a rather lovely place. Probably on a very minor dose but drugs effect me so much more thanks to my chronic over thinking. . Anyway rather pleased with this compound considering the pathetic amount I have realistically ingested. Hope that helps anyone that lives in a world ruined by cannabis such as myself lol.


Oh and also just thought id mention timw perception is definitely off. Feels like ive been sat here forever when infavt its only been a few hours. And sorry for typos I'm using my phones browser and the keyboards auto correct is less than effecient :S

mdai is such a great anti depressant its not even funny even at doses real low. Issue with me is the dizzy shit. It seems everytime, I get real floaty nice, then while sleeping it goes bad at night dizzy, odd shitty feeling in my head like its spinning. Its good stuff. Just not for me obviously.

My friends and I all seem to have trouble going to sleep after mdai, which is strange since it isn't a stimulant. I don't know nearly enough about organic chemistry, however as I understand it seretonin is made into melatonin which in turn is released when it gets dark and makes you feel sleepy. Could it be that after mdai you have lower than normal levels of seretonin and therefore lower than normal levels of melatonin so you don't feel tired? Please correct me if theres some glaring error that people who actually know anything about this sort of thing can see.

I find it difficult to get to sleep too soon after dosing MDAI too. That said, I don't find its effects sedative, rather more like a mild stimulant effect, so that could be why.

Got quite a good effect from this chemical a couple of weeks back. Subtle, but definitely something there, and went well with drinking. I believe the optimum dosing window with this substance in particular might be quite narrow - sub 200mg doses seem to have little effect, but higher doses can be rather nice. I took around 150mg a few weeks before and got no discernable effect.

I never thought MDAI was a disappointment at all, given the scope of what it does. Expecting a pure SSRA to make a good club drug or fulfill x other purpose was obviously optimistic.


It's a chill-out evening with some mates, some music and maybe a few drinks or joints and it serves that purpose remarkably well.

Hey all,

so i've been lucky to try this a few times. this last weekend i decided to up my dose to double (splitting a couple hours in between so I could make it to the afterhours club). it was very intense after effects. about the same level of feeling good maybe some more energy. i found more muscle contraction, especially in my face. my mouth was incredible dry! and the lights (mind you i was not wearing my glasses) were much more bright and distinct. that night i did not sleep but laid in bed for a couple hours listening to some music and experienced Closed eye visuals. i have not experienced that before. cartoons and such ...it was very interesting. after affects right now are like the first time i took. anxiety and strange feeling but things are more bright and i continue to try and look at the positive side of these after effects. i do not think i will take double the dose again. i'm going to give myself several months before I take it again). i love it but need to take a little break. dancing was amazing as usual though!

CEV? Really? I'd say that if it was real MDAI, you overdosed somewhat. You shouldn't really experience any hallucinogenic effects unless you gave yourself mild serotonin syndrome.


Be careful with this one, plenty of us have underestimated it at our peril!

I thought **[this](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/597521-Isle-of-Mann-Ban-deadly-%E2%80%98legal-high%E2%80%99-says-father?p=10087308#post10087308)**was worth a mention in this thread. It's a news story about a girl who apparently died after taking MDAI. I'd love to know people's thoughts about this...My understanding of MDAI is that it's actually very safe on its own.

Judging by the HORRIBLE stomach cramps and heartburn I get the days following MDAI use, I'd say the stuff is either very corrosive or just very irritant. Nasty...

well it depends really. some batches are more pure than others, some are known to contain substances used in the cleanup of the synthesis. it might be these that cause these effects. if it really did have a serious corossive or irritant quality, it would probably be a lot more prevalent and far more people would mention it.

I googled about the pink/red coloring of skin, found out it happened to another research chemist. decided to mix some with distilled water and some with saliva (Ph difference) i will check on it a few hours later. Just to be sure i will find myself a new supplier though.

Mine and a friends stained anything it touched red. I ended up throwing it out. Something is wrong if it is as potent as food coloring at turning things red. I would really like to hear from a mod about what this possibly could be. When I got it about a year ago this didn't happen. I'm glad I only allergy tested it at 1-2 mg before taking a whole dose of this stuff.

Hi Psaxxon ...in re: to your use of MDAI 125mg 3-4x per month: have you noticed any long term negative effects? I have used it several times over last 4 months (waiting at least 2 weeks -4 weeks before each dose) . I once doubled the dose and found it to be too overwhelming in the evening. I even experienced closed eye visuals  (at least I don't think I was sleeping / dreaming). Anyone else experienced that?

Everything the powder touching turning red like food coloring I think is something that needs to be discussed more. Something just didn't seem right there to me, nor should it.

I am planning on taking 4-FA and MDAI next weekend. 200 mg of 4-FA (this dosage was well tested by me in the retrospective) and 200 mg of MDAI just before I reach the plateau from the first 4-FA bomb. . I did extensive research on 4-FMA in the past and I find it to be an inferior chem comparing to 4-FA due to extra-long duration (hours after the real euphoria is over) and a heavier load on the body. 4-FA caused better quality euphoria and lasted much shorter totally not giving as many undesirable side-effects.. So I think that MDAI will go very nicely with it.


I read on the other forums that this combo is highly enjoyable. . I hope that MDAI is better than 4-MEC as that was just acting for a very short period of time (just over an hour since peaking) but did provide satisfying results if no more than two separate doses were taken throughout the night, everything above that caused little positive effects and instead brought upon me anxiety and short-lived dysphoria (used to dose in the 200-300 mg range each time taking it). However, I never had a comedown from 4-MEC to speak of, even after the first trial when I dosed it 3 times: 250 mg every hour and half. Still could fall asleep the same night and feel fine next day with some lingering warmth aftereffects.. I know that MDAI has a bad comedown but I will try to counteract it by dosing 5-HTP post my trip. In the past it was a GREAT help to ease after-effects of chemically induced serotonergic toxicity.


I am very confident in 4-FA as in the past I had a 2g experience over 3 days that didn't end too badly and I still managed to get some sleep in between (but in order to do that I drunk a few shots of whiskey). 


Wish me luck! I will be back with a short report. If you have any advices before I indulge I would be more than happy to hear them out.


P.S. I think that people are eager to combine MDAI with other chems because we got spoiled either from good MDMA or quality Mephedrone/Methylone (which are all illegal now, including USA). Taking MDAI on its own could very well be just fine but if I am to face a shitty comedown I would rather have a blast a night before that would seem to be worth it.. However, serotonergic comedowns for me are always much better than dopaminergic ones (depressed and bluesy vs eternal tiredness and severe depression). Nodding off in a chair watching movies or walking in the park from MDAI alone could not be as good as some wild, active, stimulation-infused experience (but def. not as destructive).. At least in my humble opinion.

P.P.S. HOWEVER, regardless of what I am going to do to my own body I wouldn't recommend anyone inexperienced in both substances to try to mix them. 200 mg might be OK for me but may be way too much for someone else. Always start out small, make allergy tests and be reasonable.

**Best Experience**


I have found that mixing about 250-350mg of MDAI in a glass of orange juice provides the best affects. The MDAI is acidic and thus is camouflaged well by the orange juice. I have only used to white (supposedly stronger batch) kind rather than the typical brown crystals.

how is the depression on this after? 


I want a mild serotonin booster to compliment mdppp. 6apb I found consistently to give me ghastly depression such that I won't touch it again. 


I was thinking 5-apb but this seem s like it'll fit the bill effects wise.


Important thing is how is the comedown. I don't mean the initial comedown but the real crash that comes in on the dreaded 'suicide tuesday'. 


So clue me in on that if yall could, cheers. 


Anyway it doesnt seem to be around atm so one for the backburner, just doing a lil research for now.

It has become illegal in some (many) places. unfortuantely i doubt it will be appearing on the black market as it isnt that valued by the community at large. a shame really, as it is quite the gentle chem.

it might be a good thing though. if it doesnt get banned everyhwere and it appears cyclially every year or so, it is way better than a constant demand for it....

I tried some MDAI recently, it was brown and kind of wet and clumpy. I took 200mg... I didn't feel very great, mainly felt some slight stimuation. I drank some alcohol, but later when I tried to go to sleep I couldn't for the life of me due to the MDAI 

Overall a pretty shitty experience

ive been mildly interested in mdai for a couple years but never got around to trying it. Now with 5 and 6apb around it seems somewhat pointless apart from possibly being less toxic.

id just stop the mdpv. seriosuly, that stuff is quite bad for your health and not to mention your morale.... in fact, i would go so far as to say that if you plan on using it, jsut stick to that one, because you know the effects of it, a trance night is no night to try out combos with drugs youve not use on their onw first...


so

if i were you id stop the mdpv. 

wait a while (weeks). try the mdai, see how i like it, then ask this question again....

I'm trying to figure out some "empirical" data on this substance, which I can't find anywhere! nothing but conflicting reports, which are really bad for harm reduction. 

Does anyone know, for example, something as simple as "WHAT COLOR SHOULD MDAI TURN WITH MARQUIS?" 


I just want to know what MDAI ISN'T at very least. I can't find accurate reagent information, and I feel this is totally harm reduction. I am also very confused by the whole different color thing, but I don't expect any real answers. I just know that I've seen some that turned a bright red with marquis, and some that was white in color, had no reaction with marquis, but turned brown with mecke. What does this mean? Can someone tell me about reagents and how they apply to MDAI? I've had a thread about this closed recently and all I'm trying to do is be safe and know what EZTEST is supposed to turn. Its funny I always hear about EZTESTS on this site.

I've seen most people saying MDAI turns a dark brown/"red-ish" brown on Marquis tests. I don't think I've seen any of them saying they had their MDAI lab tested though so I can't confirm without a doubt if that's correct - but the consensus does seem to be "dark brown/red" for MDAI ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Double check though before assuming that this is correct.

Says dark brown, so I'd assume that's correct ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Do you guys feel that mdai is a worthy replacement for mdma when it comes to combinations? Combinations such as 2cb, mushrooms, acid, etc? Do you think the lack on energy with mdai may be preferable to mdma when combined with other already stimulating psychedelics?

A stmulant is really the only thing you should combine if anything with MDAI but thats my personal opinion.


I wish I didnt get brain zaps from MDAI. That is the only reason I never had to much of a good time taking it although it seemsto only happen when I would get sleepy. It has slways been quite a time with a stim added with but afterwards always got brainzaps during my test runs so I decided its obviously something I cannot partake.

Unless you have really impure meth or a solid bit of tolerance, that meth dose seems pretty high.

If you're already on Oxycodone and Morphine I wouldn't add alcohol to the mix, mixing stimulants and depressants puts a lot of strain on your heart, so the mix could already be quite risky depending on your dosage and opiate tolerance, I definitely wouldn't add alcohol. No need and it'll only add risk rather than much of anything enjoyable.


Also, merged.

I'm just trying to find out reagent information. I have heard two things:


1) it is SUPPOSED to show NO REACTION with Marquis, but impurities turn it red sometimes, and no reaction/white when pure (and brown with mecke)


2) it is SUPPOSED to turn to immediate red with Marquis, and also brown with Mecke


I don't even know which one to believe, and this makes a huge difference in terms of harm reduction. Someone experienced with this, please give some input!

Nope. Not even sort of. It has its own feel, and is not a party drug. Even combined with a stimulant, you're much better off just getting some molly if that's what you're going for. Methylone is more like a "sort of" MDMA if you ask me (though not as good IMO)


What really interests me is 5-Me-MDA.... now that sounds promising ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) also MDOH and stuff (though these are NOT that much like mdma, more like "twisted" analogs of MDA)

Okay, I was sold what I was informed was MDMA recently by a source I've never used before (I just moved to a new town, and apparently MDMA is really hard to get here. Sadface) and I believe I may have been sold MDAI.


It is a pale golden brownish colour, oddly sticky, and does not have the usual, highly distinctive MDMA smell. In fact, it has no real discernible odour at all. I was dubious at first, but willing to forgo the peculiarities if it checked out when I tested a small bump, insufflated sober.


Not so. The effects were admittedly pleasant, but more akin to antidepressants in character, if not intensity. Warm relaxation not unlike weak-affinity opioids, things seemed brighter and more pleasant. Little noticeable euphoria. No rush or desire to dance, and most importantly, absolutely no increased sense of emotional openness and understanding.


Now having no previous experience with MDAI, and no marquis on hand to test, I want to know what you guys think. -snip-

And a secondary question: how inadvisable, on a scale of one to ten, would it be to take this potentially unknown chemical? 


You dont actually need to answer that last one, by the way ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

We don't allow you to ask for drug identification or "What did I take?" on Bluelight - no-one can tell you that, there are many hundreds of drugs that would fit any effects profile and since this is a harm reduction forum, speculation is completely against what we stand for and will only lead to people getting hurt.


Also, I removed the price discussion, that isn't allowed either.


This [test results](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/512598-Marquis-Mecke-Mandellin-results-for-stim-empathogen-2C-X-RC-s-amp-more) thread might be handy for you, that's really the only way to have any idea of what you're taking when unsure - buy a test kit, and use it. They're damn cheap for the fact they'll save you lots of time, effort, money, and possibly even your life. :D


To answer your last question, if you have any doubt about what the drug you're consuming is, you should send it off to a lab for testing, or test it yourself with marquis or a similar test kit. If you can't do either, just bin it. Do not consume it or give it to anyone else.

**Forms OF MDAI**


I have found that there are three main forms of MDAI. 

The most common being a very fine white powder usually called gold MDAI. Low quality stuff. Usually requiring 500mg for a great trip.

The Brown Powder. This stuff is low quality and not worth the money.

The best MDAI is the white crystals. There are very few vendors with this kind. Very High quality stuff. Usually requiring 100-250mg for an amazing trip that makes you so happy that you have a permagrin. Makes you rub the carpet and furry wall if you catch my drift.

What do you guys recommend as a good starting dose with mdai as I have a G coming but havent tried it before? 


I want a very modest dose as I plan be adding 2-fa too to give it some stimulant kick.


Just reading this: [http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=691](http://www.erowid.org/references/refs_view.php?ID=691)


I have heard about how it;s bad to mix dopa and serotonin drugs...should it be casue for concern? 


I know lots of ppl seem to do it but still doesnt mean they should :D/it isnt risky.

Trip reports should be in the Trip Reports forum rather than in the Big & Dandy threads, just fyi. If you want people to see them here, post it in TR, and then post a link here. No harm done though, I moved it over for you. It's just done that way so people looking for trip reports don't have to wade through these threads and can find them easily by searching the correct forum ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I bought 2g of what i think is MDAI; It looks like shredded white-like optic fibers (needle like crystals) and smells like vinegar.


Since then i took it 2 times; first time i tried 120mg oral and later 50mg sublingual and sniffed a tiny bit of speed in order to try to achieve a MDMA-like high. MDAI is the most pure therapeutic relaxed side of MDMA, but the strange thing is, normally speed gives me a chemical-like feeling, BUT MDAI nullified the chemical touch to it.


Anyhow 3 days later i tried it a second time with 250 mg and i was sold; The first time i tried MDMA, i got CEV's which i could control and when the longer i looked at it, the stronger it becomes and MDAI gave me exact the same CEV's without the intense rush of MDMA.


Anyhow i was thinking about it; If somebody took MDMA with MDAI, would the effects stack or multiply eachother?

Acquired a gram of MDAI to test quality before buying in bulk, but I have not taken this compound before so I don't know how to rank the potency. I was hoping you guys could help me figure out if I got a good product. Unfortunately, I didn't sleep last night and ingested ~45 mg amphetamine today, so I don't know how accurate my assay is (the psychological amphetamine effects had essentially worn off when I tried the MDAI).

60mg? That's certainly more potent than what I got as MDAI, but what I got wasn't necessarily MDAI so who knows? The best way I would describe is mood elevation, rather than euphoria or relaxation. It made me feel the way you do after a nice day with a couple of friends doing nothing. Contentment is as good a way to put it as any and again it wasn't forced like mdma or stimulants, but still not 100% natural. Mine has effects that last longer though. Probably about 3-4 hours? Also the last time I had it 2 weeks ago, it was an eyeballed dose that was quite large (anywhere from 300 to 400mg), and it made me feel extremely warm/hot not dissimilar to alcohol warmth, I also after about 6 hours afterwards experienced a comedown identical to mdma in nature but stronger got very depressed, but that only lasted for about 2 hours. I also find it fucks up my sleep, no clue as to why though. Mine was white, but I'm afraid I have no test results.

It's possible that sleep deprivation and amphetamine had a strong effect on it. I don't think I ever got anything like that from the rest of my sample. I now have another sample which is slightly off-white.


Reagent test results:

Marquis: Red which slowly turns to dark brown. Fizzes initially.

Mecke: Slight green which also slowly turns to dark brown.

Simon: Negative

This sample responded less strongly to the reagent tests, so it's possible that these colors could have been hidden in the results for my previous sample.


Will report back with bioassay, so that these test results can be used as a reference to evaluate the likely potency of a sample.


Update: This sample is definitely more potent. A dose of 150 mg orally provides a strong body high, relaxation, contentment, and tactile enhancement. I don't know why everyone seems down on MDAI, this is awesome ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I just got 1g from a highly reliable (at least in all other orders) supplier who isn't UK based, which I think is where a lot of the MDAI urban legends come from. It's a fine brown powder, and claims that it's 98%+ pure. I did a Mecke/Marquis, and the Mecke fizzled like crazy and then turned pitch black with brown outer edges, and the Marquis turned orange and then turned dark purple/black as well.


It definitely seems to react in the same way as an MDA/MDMA, but give the talk of Brown being bad, and years of fake/substitutes being sold as MDAI, I'm concerned about this. From what I'm reading it sounds really awesome (when real), but I'm afraid it's either a low-quality batch, or something else. 


I was told that likely the next batch made was going to be washed of its brown color, as the purity is the about same, but that having tested 99%+ purity tested MDAI will be sell better. I'm likely going to try 150mg tonight, as I haven't taken any MD(X) chemicals in months, or Methylone or Mephedrone ever. 


This seems like it's a cheap, solid alternative to a lot of RCs and MDMA copycats, but I don't like this specific compound having its online data ALL over the fucking place. I was planning on putting it in a gelcap, or possibly bombing it, as it has a potent smell to it, but - any red flags here, aside from the "ingesting random compounds ordered from the internet that have no regulation on them?"

My 2cents:


This drug has gotten a mixed reputation because it is being commonly sold in a significantly impure form or something else entirely. 


This drug is STONG. I have had tested pure MDMA on several occasions and I think this has the potential to be everybit as intense as MDMA. The difference is the relative (although not total) lack of stimulation and a slight opoid-like sedation. As far as I can tell there's no real crash or next day depression. 


I prefer this to 6-apb and consider it on par with MDMA (really). 


One thing I've been wondering about are parameters for usage frequency. This is obviously not an every day drug and probably not an every week drug. I can sense it could tip emotionally sensitive individuals over the edge. I know Bluelight's policy is to "play it safe" and since we know little about this compound, the once per month minimum mdma rule should probably apply.


But, I hope someone more knowledgeable than me about neuropharmacology can help me out: Since this is a selective serotonin releaser, is it any likely to be less likely to cause depression than MDMA *if* used often?


BTW, my batch is pure white, with needle-like crystals.

Hi!


Here I left my short experiencie with MDAI:


I bought 500 mg of MDAI, then analized it: it was MDAI, sinthesys subproducts and a solid diluent. 


Not so pure, but I tried 60 mg. It make me feel slightly depressed, so around 12 am I fell asleep. Around 3 hours later I woke up feeling feverish and confused.

I also was taking Paroxetine 10 mg ED. Could it be a mild SS?


I'm still taking Paroxetine, so I couldn't give it another try.

4-FA 120 mg + MDAI 150 mg is pretty damn good, like E but actually more energy I'd say. I think if I try the combo again I might even go lighter on the 4-FA and heavier on the MDAI ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Oh, and I feel fine the next day, woke up with an afterglow and had no trouble in a 3 hour block of class. Took antioxidants before and after and postloaded with 5-HTP before going to sleep and upon waking up.

Is Paroxetine Prozac? I didn't think it was


As a side note, is taking MDAI while on Prozac actually bad? From what I understood of reading both the big and dandy threads it would just dull the effects of the MDAI somewhat

No, Prozac is Fluoxetine, but both are SSRIs. I also thought that my low dose of Paroxetine only will dull the effects of MDAI, luckly I was cautious and took only ~60 mg MDAI. I cannot tell that MDAI+SSRI=SS, but I won't try it again.

My MDAI has no scent. I may send in a sample of mine to ecstasydata.org, and if I do and it turns out to be pure MDAI I will provide you guys with whatever information you want about its physical properties (already posted reagent test results).


I just wish it weren't so steep, $120 for one test 8( I'm tempted to press it into an E pill and send it in for 40 xD

Mine is a white odorless powder and it contains MDAI, products of synthesis and a diluent.


Any idea about the products of synthesis? Maybe it can be responsible about the mild SS, or the MDAI itself.

mine is also a white powder, but it contains NO MDAI at all...

Laboratory analysis showed a mixture of BZP and TFMPP (altogether 40% ) 

and Caffeine ( 60% ) ... and no MDAI at all...  it was from UK  8( 

so test your "mdai" because many suppliers often sell something else 

labeled as "mdai" ... sometimes cathinones, sometimes piperazines, 

and who knows what more... and this is why we have to test it !!!

and then report our results to the public! people have to know this!


(i'm not saying that "most of MDAI" is fake, we don't have enough 

data to claim something like that, but for sure we can say that 

there is alarmingly high percentage of fake MDAI on the market)


we have to take some steps in order to change this

The MDAI I got from my plug was a "golden brownish color" and smelled sweet like bubble-gum undertone, with a sassy smell also. 


I wish it was still around, very interesting drug. I'm currently obsessed with researching, reading about it, and hopefully get to experiment with MDAI again. The most unusual, yet subtly and euphoric, dreamy effects. Great with 4-FA. Great to chill out from other stims/psychedelics (ie LSD). Great + marijuana too! 


I'd like to try a more potent batch. My plug once gave me what seemed to be a more pungently sassy, darker. More of a sedating MDA visual enhancement with pleasant body tingles.

I've acquired some good purity batches of MDAI, and both are white and have a silky fibrous texture, not much of an odor either.


I find that +150mg doses are really quite euphoric and relaxing, and I usually reach a happy baseline after around 6 hours and continue to feel great throughout the next day. The really interesting thing is taking threshold doses. It will kill a bad mood and allow you to be productive, I find this quite useful and therapeutic.

Hey i had this drug along with mkat when it was legal! it was a perfect mix. i bombed the mdai and sniffed the mkat.

it gave me eyewobbles and alot of euphoria. (nothing of what mkat does to you now). the mdai though put me in such a DEEP sleep. and i mean it must of been. considering i havent wet the bed since i was about 8. :')!  such a weird thing to wake up to. pretty embarresing, im guessing mdai is still LEGAL. i may try get hold of it again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

YES. I just came here to post this. I'm able to sleep after I've been on MDAI, no matter what else I took.


I'm thinking that it's the serotonin being converted into melatonin.

Is this chemical anything worth alone? I know some who says it's pretty inactive on its own and you have to use it in combinations with something else.


Has anyone tried it with combination of MDMA? What doses?

Combinations are good. I've not tried it with MDMA, but with 4-FA it's awesome.

I would have thought that and I think I even posted it in this thread, but I've found the exact opposite after actually trying mdai I found I couldn't sleep at all and can't any time I take it. It could just be that I'm not actually getting real mdai though.

Having put this off for many months have finally got around to ordering some...previously decided not to due to such varied reports about different batches.


Arrived this morning from UK and came in a sealed silver packet(plastic baggy contained within), with white warning chem sticker and handwritten label(didn't immediately inspire confidence!)... 


Will try and get a clear pic on here at some point, but this is slightly off white, finely crystalline.It does seem to have a cystally shimmer/sparkle to it in the light. and doesn't seem to exhibit a smell.


Any comments?


May possibly try in a few days... no testing kit though, sorry all.

^ Yep, please read over the BL User Agreement and Forum Guidelines. Vendor discussion isn't allowed. That isn't just limited to naming the vendor as you did either.


Also, we don't do drug identification, and it's impossible to identify a chemical or a batch from how the powder looks.

It's really lame that you're upset at not being able to tell how bomb your MDAI is for this weekend and you're putting it on harm reduction. There are plenty of appropriate communities to talk about the purity of the chems you've acquired from specific suppliers, and those are not bluelight. There are plenty of reasons for this, I suggest PMing a moderator for more detail if you're curious.

There is no way to verify a user's experiences with a certain source, or that if these experiences were good future ones will be too. We also have had many vendors themselves and affliates of vendors hyping up products here - if we allowed people to discuss vendors, they would likely cloud the reports with inaccuracy and lead to people buying impure and mislabelled products - now **that** is counter productive to harm reduction.


Now an example of where it can happen with legitimate users. In the past I obtained some Mephedrone that was amazing quality etc, I told a real life friend, and they got some from the same source, they were then sold a batch that appeared to be cut and impure - it seems the once legitimate source had gone bad. This happens all the time. Luckily my friend was not hurt as a result, but someone easily could be, and it's not in peoples best interests to openly discuss sources in such a way - particularly when these threads get archived for long periods of time, and vendors do often go from legitimate to scammers.


I understand your concern, but we've had this rule for a long time, and it's not going to change unless we magically find some way of policing legitimate vendors.

The comedown's quite different to mdma I think. I don't get much of a comedown as such, I can't sleep for the night or at least sleep well and then the next day I can't really concentrate or do anything productive but I don't feel bad just sort of spaced out, the night after the that I end up sleeping at least 12 hours and then I'm back to normal. Also the residual effects last longer I find, for example I wouldn't classify myself as sober 7-8 hours after taking mdai but I would 7-8 hours after taking mdma.

Out of curiosity I bought a g, its light brown an clumpy with a light aroma. I took about 250mgs an i can say this, Im getting this cozy slight speedy reaction. Much cleaner than any other RC but doesnt hit you as hard, worth trying and probaly good to mix. I feel like a freakin robot as i write this.

I seems that legitimate MDAI can be either white or brown, the brown one containing some impurities, but probably due to synthesis complications. However, getting white powder labeled as MDAI is not a guarantee of pure substances, since they may be piperazines instead. And any speed-like stimulation from supposed MDAI definitely indicates the presence of something that is NOT legitimate MDAI.

not really, at least not in my experience. ive tried mdai from several batches over a period of time, and always i get slight stimulation (at least not like a full on stimulant, like for instance 4fa at 100mg dose), and also residual stimulation that impedes sleep for some hours after the plateau phase. a symptom should never be considered as defining for identifying a chemical. just my thoughts.

I definitely agree that there is some stimulation with high quality MDAI, but considering that MDAI is a highly selective serotonin releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor and seems not to affect dopamine and norepinephrine, any stimulation that can be subjectively determined to have a distinct dopaminergic stimulation is probably the sign of some dopaminergic adulterant, maybe some piperazine like BZP which messes with both dopamine and norepinephrine.

I'd like to discuss my experience with a low dose of MDAI. I have the fibrous crystal pure white sort. For some background I have had MDMA once and had a pretty bad week long comedown. At around 6:40 PM I ingested 20mg to test for an allergic reaction. In around 45 minutes the effects kicked in. I felt VERY relaxed and slightly light headed. There was not much euphoria but watching television and some stand up comedy was extremely hilarious for whatever reason. I felt NO stimulation. After about 4 hours I decided it was about time to hit the sack so I layed down.


This is when things went downhill. I all of the sudden felt what I could only describe as a cold twinge running down the back of my neck. It felt like the beginning of a panic attack. It then drifted away and I again tried to close my eyes. At first I was relaxed but then it felt as if my mind was split into to segments, one relaxed, and one rattling on and on in constant thought. It was the strangest feeling, it literally felt like I was having two seperate streams of thought occuring at the same time. I also felt an odd pressure on the left front portion of my brain. Then in almost a concious dream I just felt like there were seven faces looking in at me, representing parts of me. I had to go to the restroom so I got up, figuring on giving up on sleeping. I was becoming very agitated by people talking in the next room and when the dog barked I almost went nuts. At this point I started to panic a bit and brought out the clonozepam. 1.5mg and in two hours I was asleep and able to make work the next day.


I few things I've taken away from this. One, I'm glad I did not try a large initial dose at first. Two, I believe this to be MDAI or some sort of SSRA, not any stimulant. I do not believe the effects were placebo any longer due to the sudden comedown. Third, I believe the bad effects I suffered were due to serotonin depletion. During the episode I also suffered from swings in body temperature and feared that I had somehow induced serotonin syndrome, so I would take 5-HTP. I realise now that this was unlikely as I do not take any SSRIs or MAOIs. My symptoms literally progressed exactly as described here [http://voices.yahoo.com/symptoms-low-serotonin-levels-3417422.html?cat=70](http://voices.yahoo.com/symptoms-low-serotonin-levels-3417422.html?cat=70) I believe according to what my mother told me once that low serotonin runs on her side of the family if such a thing is possibe


Today I was having anxiety spikes like a mild version of my MDMA comedown. At lunch I took 100mg of HTP, felt sleepy for a half hour, and now feel MUCH better.


Anyone have any thoughts on this? Could supplementing beforehand with 5HTP solve this issue?

20mg of MDAI wouldn't do anything. Its not even threshold. You didn't get MDAI I'm afraid.

That was my concern but speaking with a few others the source, look, taste, and texture are the same and they claim that it is in fact MDAI. I may just have a bad reaction to it.

200mgs of MDAI is beyong threshold mate. Like ... 90mgs is enough for a first timer. I get brain zaps from it so I stopped testing it out but it is mos def active at 20mgs. I dunno why some of you think 500mgs is a Dose...thats a shit ton...

I think my comedown pretty much ended today. The last two days I would get waves of some serious anxiety and for the most part they are very mild today. I'm going to go ahead and assume this stuff is not for me. I'm just so damn curious as to why such a serious bad reaction occurred.

20mg, not 200mg. 20mg is not threshold, definitely not strong.

I've spoken to a few other forum members and it seems the latest batch of fibrous crystals is more potent at lower doses. I don't if this means its not MDAI or if for the first time its very pure MDAI. I just hope it isn't 4-MTA. The only trip report on erowid seems to be some of what I went though haha.

In my experience, MDAI can be felt all the way down to the 5mg range if it's pure. I actually find it extremely useful to take 5mg doses throughout the day when I'm feeling a little down, it helps me boost my mood to a surprising extent, and I get no side effects, ever. Definitely very real therapeutic potential here.

You can never know for sure unless you send it for a Lab Test.

i sent mine, and laboratory analysis showed a mixture of BZP and TFMPP 

and Caffeine ... there was no MDAI in the mixture at all !!!

suppliers often sell something else labeled as "mdai" ... 

sometimes cathinones, sometimes piperazines, 

and who knows what more... 

this is why we have to test it

there is alarmingly high percentage of fake MDAI on the market

be careful

My vendor referred to it as "brown", but I'd call it a dirty yellow.  It's a very fine powder that sticks to your fingers and forms into clumps.  I actually submitted a sample to ecstasydata.org, I'll remember to link to it here if they post an analysis.

5,6-Methylenedioxy-1-indanone 


That wouldn't even be psychoactive. No primary amine. Evidently the machinery is dodgy.

I'm not sure how to read the ecstasydata.org report.  Is it saying that it was 50% 5,6-Methylenedioxy-1-indanone, and 50% an unidentified substance?  Do they count the gelcap itself?  I know I sent them 40mg of the substance in a gelcap that weighed 40mg, note they say the "size" is 81mg, do you think they are counting the gelcap as the "Unidentified"?

I would guess so. Weigh one of your caps. If its 41mg roughly then you know.


I fail to see how they could mistake an Amine group for a ketone. However it is at the wrong position so you could possibly have MDAI with the amine at the 2nd position not the third. Maybe 3-indane has never been sold, so we don't even know what real MDAI feels like. Maybe this explains the variances in reports from different batches. Who knows.

I've never IV'ed it and I don't plan to.  However it might not be a good idea to use this stuff if you have to get up early.  It always makes me very tired the next day.  I forced myself to wake up early the day after using it once and I kept almost falling asleep while driving until a concerta I took kicked in.

So I bought a G of MPA a while ago and I've been reading that it combines well with MDAI. I was wondering if anyone knows about combining MPA with MMAI as I found it to be cheaper.

Or any info on MDAI is appreciated.

i'm sorry, and don't mean to be obtuse, but it seems that some of what you've posted contradicts itself, e.g., u stated that the chemical, were it truly MDAI, would be white, as pure, unadulterated chemicals r, but then the photo u supplied looks clearly beige, not nearly white at all. so i'm confused. should it be white, or beige? thank u for your input.

Dude, this looks exactly like what my vendor sells. I've been doing a bunch of research trying to find out what the hell was in these pills that are readily available to anyone over 18 years of age, were marketed as "Triple Stack Mood Enhancer" and stated clearly on the packaging that it is not for human consumption. After quite a bit of reading, comparing side effects of psychoactive chemicals I settled on MDAI. I thought that for sure that was it. After further research, it is clear that this, the brownish powdery substance in your gel cap ecstacydata.org has identified as 5,6-Methylenedioxy-1-indanone, is the substance I've been trying to identify. This is very interesting, considering there is basically zero information about the effects of 5,6-Methylenedioxy-1-indanone on humans, or any other animals for that matter. Kinda tripped me out when I realized because I had figured it would be something that was already out there. Damn.

5,6-Methylenedioxy-1-indanone is a different compound than MDAI.

I understand the two compounds are different. I wsd saying that the 5,6-methylenedioxy-1-indone was active, which is pretty ignorant of me considering it must have an amine to be active as a substrate in and of itself  at synapses. I've had OChem 1&2, biochem and a host of other chem courses, so I should know better than to mistake a compound lacking an amine to act on synapses as a potent agonist of seratonin secretion and inhibitor of seratonin reuptake, which is clearly the type of compound I have. I guess the MDAI does have the closest profile of whatever seratogenic amphetamine-like molecule it may be that I'm dealing with. The capsules I have are identical to the one the above poster sent to ecstacydata.org, and we had basically the same experience with use. So when I saw the results of the tests from ecstacydata, I got a bit too excited. Furthermore, the above amine-less MDxx compound is available from online vendors. Anyway. I think I may send one of my capsules to ecstacydata data to find out for sure, what it is.

If you have real MDAI I am very surprised you can even get a boner. 5HT1A agonisation directly blocks the erectile response.

I'm able to get rock hard erections while on pure MDMA. I'd say that it does tend to have that effect particularly when you haven't used it too much, but it's something that can be moved past.

Just read a whole load of questions about identification of MDAI so here's my 2 cents after probably two dozen experiences with several different vendors:

^ The stuff I get matches that description in every aspect.


I decided to try a higher dose than usual this weekend. I had been dissolving 120 - 160mg in water and feeling pretty nice but not really euphoric. On Saturday 290mg was packed into two gel caps and swallowed, and after a slightly rough come up I felt really, really amazing - easily as euphoric as I would be on MDMA, no question. The duration was surprisingly long too - I dropped at ten thirty, was up by 11:15 and was still fucked enough at 2:40 to email my friend and tell him so.


The problem is that at that level my jaw was grinding like crazy - I had assumed that that was a feature of MDMA caused by the stimulation rather than the serotonin release, but apparently not. Luckily I had the wherewithal to smear bonjela round the damaged areas inside of my mouth before going to sleep or I'd be looking at a mouth full of ulcers. As it is, it looks like I've gotten away with just a couple.


This is a massive disappointment to me as one of the major reasons I gave up MDMA is the goddamn gurning which, for those of us predisposed to mouth ulcers, means a week or more of misery in return for one night's pleasure.

In terms of dealing with gurning, on all compounds I find preloading with magnesium really helps - and make sure you have gum for when the chewing actually starts so you don't grind down your teeth/mouth. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It's worth looking to IAP if you're looking for something with a similar effects profile. 


In general though, I'd say it's unlikely to disappear completely, it just might be tough to find yourself a new source for a while. I've been really worried when some of my favourite RCs were made illegal but in all cases I've still been able to find them, just it got a little harder.


Also, MDAI is still legal in the UK is it not? If that's the case it might make a come back. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks mate! I used to chew gum on MDMA but I still got ulcers. Also, I'd end up chewing the gum so hard it would turn into this weird liquified disgusting goo. Having said that, I would be redosing a lot which obviously made things much worse. I didn't know about the magnesium thing, thanks for that.


In terms of the MDAI shortage, isn't it just that people are out of stock at the moment?


EDIT: Actually I did a quick search and loads of UK vendors are selling it. I only see one that's out of stock.

i acually ordered 2gs recently. i could only find a UK vendor, and i live in the states, so i probably won't get it for a while....and reading the previous posts i sure hope its the real ldeal!


i have tried, in the past, to get a certain RC, don't remember what it was, but the vendor had the honesty to say they were out of stock at the moment, and offered some similar RCs, which i bought and was satisfied enough with. 


my concern is neurotoxisiy.....i'd hate to think i'm buying one thing and getting something else. wish there were a way for non-chemists to check purity, or even accuracy...

This is my first post, but hopefully I can share some info. I have learned that this compund (the flaky white shiny crystal one) needs 200+mg for affect to work as standalone compound, and it also needs 1-2 hours to kick in - that is for you to understand thet hey it's working really nice. I have also learned that there is some really nice combos you may do with this compound, that will knock your feet of, ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) You will also need less MDAI when doing this.


**I can recommend the following combos, dosage:**

150-225 mg MDAI then wait for 1,5 hours and do 15mg of 4-ho-met

or

150-225 mg MDAI then wait for 1,5 hours and do 6mg of 5-meo-mipt


The first combination will give you angel vision(*), everything will be shiny and you wil be in heaven - simply amazing.

The second combination will give put you in heaven, without the visuals.


Whatever you chose, both combinations will make that evening stand out as one of the best evenings you have ever experienced, whatever you do.


Angel vision: When someone smiles, you see a little star twinkle in their teeth...


**IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THIS COMPOUND!**

I have heard one experience now from a person getting a nasty hangover after second test of MDAI. So if you are low on serotonin in your head, be careful as serotonin hangovers are the worst! I can recommend eating be pollen, this will boost your serotonin rebuilding.

I have not been able to aquire 5-HTP, however I was under the impression 5-HTP was releasing serotonin - be pollon rebuilds it faster. I might be wrong. I have however been wanting to check out 5-HTP without any luck (try harder, lol).


What I do recommend is the following for anyone that likes to party is:


**Bee pollen** - theese are energy rich and full spectrum B vitamins. Its an old hippie trick for people using acid to eat this so you do not need to wait for 14 days for your brain to fully recover, but do it in say 5 days instead. Serotonin levels are also rebuildt much faster with be pollen.


**Cacao powder**, 100%. This contains alot of dopamine, serotonin and tryptofans and a lot of antioxidants. Considered a legal high in itselg by professional athletes. I always drink a good shot of this any time, preferrably every day as it gives your body alot of vitamins and important stuff you lose during "hard times" so to speak.


As protein powder I recommend a protein shake here and there with **hamp proteins**. They have the special benefit of containing 12 amino acids which your body cant create itself, but loves. It also gives you proteins - which our body so loves!


Funny enough, all above ingredients are made by the same company that have the slogan "Love your life", Supernature.


**Royal Jelly**, this is also a bee product but has the benefit of when your brain are rebuilding cell membrains, the fuel your body are running on are found in royal jelly. Needless to say - it's damn good for you.


finally,


**L-Arginine**

This is for normal days, when you are not even drinking - L-Arginin. This is an antioxidant that flushes your body and rinses your veins. Should not be used when partying as it makes your body feel alittle sick (since it's repairing so to speak). 


If any of you have more tips for stuff/vitamins to eat for people like us I would love for tips. I spent some good researtch landing on the above ingredients.


Also, if you need a snack while on a party, be sure to have a bowl containing Goji Berries mixed with cacao nibs instead of chips! Theese are the most energy packed stuff on earth, and some of this while forgetting to eat works miracles!

that is all great info - thanks! i'm surprised u can't find 5-HTP as its carried in most any food or drug store here (states) or used to b - maybe not anymore, but surely u can find it online. i've taken it in the past for anxiety/insomnia and wasn't much impressed at all, but that's just me -(btw, how do u drinkthe cocoa powder? isn't it extremely bitter? how much at a time do u take?)


meanwhile i got the MDAI yesterday and did some and wanted to die! either it isn't MDAI or my body chemestry is fucked....I felt feverishand misserable, no pleasurable feelings at all....ididn't do much tho, but i can't imagine a higher dose would help....i was/am experiencing very mild (in my book anyway) opiate wds, could that have been the reason?

I also felt feverish and dizzy taking only 60 mg of MDAI when on Paroxetine 10 mg ED.

It was something like a Serotonin Syndrome. Wellbutrin is a potential causative of SS, but there aren't many cases reported.

thanks again - oh, so after that bad experience did u do it again and have a better/good one? had u gone off the Peroxitine?

I've never tried MDAI again, I'm still taking Paroxetine.

I think you should break your treatment with Wellbutrin, even only 1 week, if you really need it.

lady_stardust, you can't take MDAI, MDMA, or other serotonin-releasing compounds if you're on antidepressants. It will lead to the symptoms you're describing. St. John's Wort and 5-HTP are also bad things to combine with MDxx drugs.

Tried ethylphenidate and MDAI today, and can say it is quite a lovely combination!     - note I have never had MDMA. 4-FA is the closest Empathogen. YMMV


T+ 0 : MDAI 90mg orally

T+45 min : 45mg orally

T+1 hr : 40mg Ethylphenidate insufflated

T+1 hr 30 min : 25 MDAI insufflated (no discomfort) + 30mg Ethylphenidate

T+2 hr : 30mg Ethylphenidate + 1.5mg etizolam


At first I felt a calm sense of peace and body temperature changes, which slowly progressed into a pleasant sociable and empathetic state. I felt compelled to message a few people on facebook, talking easily and openly about many topics I would usually be too anxious to bring up. Not only was i not anxious, I was very confident. I could approach more personal topics in a far better manner than I usually would. I was very chatty and energised; this could become a favourite for partying / socializing.


Music, sound and cognition was enhanced. I felt the need to dance, something I don't often do, especially with such confidence. Playing guitar was great, very creative and fun playing along to some good songs.  


As I continued with the Ethylphenidate it became less special; it's more-ish nature is something I am quite susceptible to. This leveled off into a plateau which was mentally comfortable and generally pleasant. Music not as great anymore, but still enjoyable. Some chills through the body noted. 


T+3 - Ethylphenidate is overpowering MDAI I believe. I feel slightly compelled to do the usually more mundane tasks of life, instead of having fun and socialising. I am becoming more driven to write, study, organise, or complete some sort of project. It is not forceful with MDAI included though. Usually Ethylphenidate will compell me very strongly to do these things, where as this time, I can alternate quite easily.


T+4 - Some residual stimulation, etizolam has wiped out any comedown. Off to gymnastics in 2 hours for a good stretch. I better avoid any strenuous gymnastics exercises tonight.


Overall, I am extremely impressed. A perfect combination for a relaxing day with family, friends, or maybe a small party.


Finally, I'm under the assumption this combination is not very neurotoxic. If I'm not mistaken neruotoxicity is largely influenced by a flood of serotonin and a DA agonist. (4-FA + MDAI, 4-FA + Methylone). Seeing as Ethylphenidate is a reuptake inhibitor, the same issues are not involved. (Ritalin is neuroprotective I believe).


I would appreciate if anyone with more knowledge could confirm/deny this? Or any other thoughts on the combination.

I've taken MDAI a couple of times in the recent months. Usually I'm no fan of the substance, but last time the addition of 150 mg caffeine to 250 mg MDAI had a huge impact and made the experience very pleasurable. Usually I'm just very sedated and cloudy on MDAI, but the addition of a stimulant made it quite fun. I also have ethylphenidate now but I'm not going to combine them, my BP gets too high on EPH alone, I don't need any further rise in my BP (quite the opposite).

ZN13bt,

thank u for this. the article i read indicatednthat the case reported where Wellbutrin was involved was not "simple". am inwrong to consider that Wellbutrin, because it is not an SSRI, is not one to b to totally concerned about? i ask, not to dispute u, but to verify, or disqualify,my assumptions....i can certainly do w/o MDAI or Wellbutrin for that matter....just curious... thanks for your input!  ... always, my fellow B & GLs,....


peace

SSRIs are not a problem in combination with MDMA. They will not lead to serotonin syndrome, they merely blunt the empathogenic effects of the roll. This is a combination that many people, including myself, have taken safely over the decades.


When combining SSRIs/SNRIs with MDMA, you will still feel the stimulation and the trippy effects attributable to the drug. However, in the case of MDAI, it is - as I understand it - solely a serotonin releaser, so combining SSRIs/SNRIs with it will likely produce little if any effect. Still, it won't be a dangerous combination since it's not an MAOI.


Just to explain this a little further in case you are confused, the pharmacological action of the SSRI prevents the serotonin efflux normally provided by MDMA or similar at the very same receptor, thus negating the danger of extra serotonin building up in the presence of an SSRI. Think of it as a uni-directional revolving door, whereby MDMA *reverses* the direction of that door and pumps serotonin back out of the neuron in to the synaptic gap. SSRIs merely place a chock in the door, preventing or slowing the flow of serotonin in either direction (the normal "direction" being into the neuron). The MDMA is trying to spin the door in the opposite direction to "normal" flow, but there's a chock in the door preventing it from doing that very efficiently.


If, theoretically, you took a large enough dose to overcome this particular action of the SSRI, you still wouldn't be in danger because the MDMA would then be overriding the effect of the SSRI that you were concerned about, thus still negating the the worry of dangerous serotonin build-up.


The only thing you have to watch out for is serotonin releasers which are also MAOIs, such as aMT. These are indeed contraindicated with SSRIs and similar drugs. Also, 5-HTP is contraindicated with strong SSRIs because it overrides the rate-limited enzyme conversion of tryptophan into serotonin, producing a rapid rise in serotonin not exacted by the mechanism of efflux as seen with MDMA. I have yet to see any serotonin syndrome reports of 5-HTP with SSRIs, but the possibility exists and they are clinically contraindicated.

I tried myself MDMA-like drugs (not MDMA itself, but M1 and 4-FA) without any problem, as you said. 

But any low dose of MDAI leads to SS-like symptoms. I don't know why, anyway MDAI is a RC, so little is known about it. 

Maybe MDAI has any other 5-HT release mechanism than SERT binding?


Anyway, combination with any SSRI seems dangerous enough to be cautious.

pre- and post-loading with 5-HTP is actually a good idea when taking serotonin-releasers. increases the desired effects and decreases the after-effects.

Sorry, I think I was getting mixed up with DXM, which is definitely not safe to take with SSRIs.


Personally I've had bad reactions taking methylone while on St. John's Wort, or with taking 5-HTP the evening after taking some 6-APB that afternoon. Like very bad nausea, hot flashes, unpleasant agitation, and feeling like I've poisoned myself. So I feel like these combinations are pretty unsafe. I suspect combining them with MDMA or MDAI would have similar effects on me (no, I'm not going to try it to see... ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) But I guess it's an idiosyncratic reaction if there are lots of other people who take 5-HTP with MDMA and have no problems with it.

Mix it with milk, and use a food processor'ish thing to stir it up as it's not easy done by hand. Doesn't taste that well, so old fashioned milk makes it the best taste. You could add some protein powder into the mix to sweaten it up - and add proteins aswell which isn't all bad.

My latest batch was white diamond shiny flakes. If you got sweaty and all that, you could be low on serotonin and should wait a while and eat stuff that will boost your serotonin levels before trying again - or get a friend to test it aswell. If he gets same reaction - throw the powder away as it's something wrong with it. I would say normally that 150mg is required for a a feeling at all. If you get a bad one, have benzo available as it will kill the trip. Sure you can also do 50 bumbs each 30 minutes, you should get a good feeling not a bad one - if a bad one stop eat a benzo and get some food into you and email your vendor for a money back or other compund.

From what I understand bee pollen contains tryptophan, which in turn makes 5-HTP which in turn makes serotonin. So foods or supplements with large doses of tryptophan will work aswell, however 5-HTP is stuff bebore your body makes it into serotonin so it would definately be the best.


As people mention, certain anxiety pills or such, or benzo, will effectively kill the MDAI/MDMA experience 100%.


If doing MDAI or MDMA benzo is what you use to kill it, so be sure you do not have any benzo in your system!


Some quick info I found on the benefits of bee pollen, which I see now also contains phenylalanine which in turn become tyrosine which is a blessing aswell, as it gives you dopamine. I love bee pollen more and more, ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay so my favorite RC that mimics MDMA is 6-apb but I can't get any at the moment so I have some MDAI now...I read somewhere that alone it doesn't do very much. Could I mix with a stimulant such as ethylphenidate? What kind of effect would a DNRI mixed with a SSRA do? I have the white crystal-light brownish MDAI from a pretty reputable vendor.

A lot of rcs are around if you cannot find rcs your not Looking. I still have a year old or older bag of MDAI I keep forgetting that I actually purchased some time ago. I never enjoyed it but it was ok with crystal

Got some MDAI from a new vendor today. It's very powdery, pure white, doesn't smell overly offensive but definitely off-neutral. Appearance reminds me of MPA but it doesn't taste like it. It was labelled as "supersynth MDAI".


Likelihood that it's actually MDAI, anyone?

Seems plausible that it's just MDAI crystals mashed down to powder but I'm not really sure what to do with it yet. Will allergy test today.

I have mixed another SRA (IAP) with Ethylphenidate with great results that somewhat resembled somewhere between Methylone and MDMA. Worth a try, just remember to be careful with your dosing as with any combo, as they'll likely potentiate each other.

Machete, please keep us posted on the results with your recent batch of MDAI. This one has become tricky to find lately, and I'm hoping to locate some myself, though it seems like it's scarce these days and I'm unsure if anyone has the real deal anymore...

Yeah, I love MDAI because it gives me euphoria, to quite extereme levels on higher doses, without stimulation. I can get loved up, listen to Townes Van Zandt's *Live at the Old Quarter* and feel like he's singing directly into my goddamn soul, and then get a good night's sleep. What is not to like about that? The only downside for me is quite bad jaw clenching at higher doses, which is interesting as you'd think that would be a symptom of stimulation rather than serotonin release.

^ I get good results from anything over 130mg, but to get MDMA type euphoria I'd at least double that. I think the highest I've dosed is 280mg. I sometimes think that people who don't find MDAI satisfying on its own are under-dosing. Not that I'm encouraging anyone to take huge doses, but I do think that if some people worked up to larger dose than the 'common' range listed on erowid they'd be surprised how awesome this substance can be without the aid of a CNS stimulant. But it depends on  what you're doing, it's very much a headphones drug rather than a club drug, which is what I'm after these days. It's a question of taste I guess, but to me it feels pretty fucking incredible.

So, I've had plenty of experience with MDAI, and I'm interested in combining it with a DRI. I was thinking ethylphenidate. Is methiopropamine a DRI or DRA? I guess what I'm getting at is if MDAI + MPA is better than MDAI + EPH, is it likely to be significantly more neurotoxic?

MDAI mixed well with 2c-b. doses were 150mg mdai, followed by ~15mg (my snorting isnt that good) insufflated after 3 hours.


basically i was at the point of coming down from mdai but thought about prolonging the night. insufflated 10mg, then 5 more of 2cb, before the paaaain!!! struck me. still, the mdai pushed everything in a nice comfy happy zone, and the 2cb put the colors right in... though it wasnt as visual as i was hoping, i must say.

just one thing. this combo made me horny as hell. orgasms were immobilizing, sending shivers up my spine.


at these doses, the mdai was good for socializing... but when the 2cb started, i couldnt see myself in a social environment.


day after, minimal side effects, but feeling tired and had little sleep thought the day. also, feeling some residual psychedelic afterglow, which is quite enjoyable and didnt manifest on previous mdai or 2cb solo trials

So that's settled then ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) it's been ages since I last tried MDAI, I kinda miss its charm. So relaxing and lovely, and great for a social gathering. I'm yet to try it with a stimulant, can't wait to see how that goes.


To anyone who has mixed MDAI with a stim, would you say it's better than 6-APB? Because I really love 6-APB haha.

Yeah MDAI gold has been around for a while it looks like but the vendor itself describes that it is inferior to the regular mdai they had before.  Damn never tried mdai and I really wanted to give it a go.  Any idea why mdai drought is happening?  As far as I know it is still legal in many countries.

MDAI has become one of my new favorites..


I have been keeping an eye out for it for a while, and I was stoked to finally see it available. Great mood lift, euphoria, music sounds wonderful and it's only been about 20 minutes. Looking forward to trying this one in combination with K and 4-FA at Benny Benassi's show next month..


My powder is tan btw. Also worth mentioning that I mixed it with aniracetam.


Now off to the beach for some surfing....

I just recently came across MDAI in my area. I picked it up at a show and the person was a friend of a friend so I started seeing him more often. At first glance it was tanish with a "sas" taste. Not so bitter but I didn't do too much. I later asked if it wasn't MDMA and proceeded to tell me its "pure" blah blah. Decided to reconnect and with a larger batch I could get a clearer view. Brown/Tan, hard balls mixed with powder. Did some online searching and it was in fact NOT MDMA. Not surprised with all of the RCs around. 


The way I feel is definitely sedative, I yawn almost 20-30 minutes after ingesting. I sometimes will get a small boost of energy/roll feeling for about 20 minutes and it will dissipate for almost 2 hours before I decide to ingest more. Although ingesting more over-time doesn't seem to increase my euphoria. Sometimes it's a hit or miss. I gave 3 friends 200mg and only 2 felt it, the other nothing. The other day I had roughly under 400mg over a 6 hour period and there wasn't too much of a euphoric feeling, more or less clear-headed. The euphoric feelings only seems to come when a song I consider a favorite comes on, for instance...Lotus - Umbilical Moonshine. As much as I do love MDMA and it's magic and intensity I am starting to enjoy MDAI, especially with it being non-neurotoxic and the sleepy trip when I want to sit down and relax after dancing. If anyone would like some more information on it, I've been receiving it frequently the past month or so.


On another note.


It tests positive for MDMA on Mecke, Marquis and Simon Reagent kits.

Ugh! Super bummed to read this just now, after I ordered some MDAI Gold last week... still waiting on delivery, and it seems there are a couple places still offering this, so it's possible we got ours from different sources, but at this point I guess I won't expect too much. Damn, this was a very important purchase for me... bought more than I'd usually get of anything and really hoped I'd gotten some before it's gone for good.


Machete, did you reagent test yours? Curious what you found the results to be via that method or any other method you used. Did it feel like anything else you've tried?

I wonder if MDAI is really non-neurotoxic. I am definitely feeling some mild depression, lethargy, and general lackadaisical feelings after using it. Granted, I went through a gram in a week.


It is a great writing aid for me, especially when combined with yerba mate. I also tried it with n2o, needless to say it was a gas. haha. It has a slow come up, about 1-2 hours, peaks for about 2 hours, and then gradually tapers off. It is somewhat sedating, but it still kept me awake later than usual. Music is essential in order to experience any sort of euphoria, and even then it is mild at best. No afterglow was noticed, although I have done MDMA a fair bit of times in the past. I also noticed stomach discomfort and general unease a few hours into each experience, reminds me of a trip report on erowid I read titled 'not worth the negatives'.


All in all it is pretty useless as a recreational drug on it's own, but I can definitely see how it could shine in combinations with psychedelics. Too bad I'm a drug addict and don't have the willpower to save any for next time I feel like tripping. 


For now, my receptors are thoroughly jumbled, I am tired, and done with drugs, right after I blow through these last couple grams of K...

Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think those symptoms are indicators of neurotoxicity, just a temporary serotonin debt.

I wouldn't bother with any brown stuff. White MDAI has recently been restocked elsewhere so it's neither the last batch or worth the money.

Hello everyone,


I liked MDAI last year very much but as for most of you, vendors I trusted have stopped selling it. I searched for it recently again and bought a gram of white'n'shiny "MDAI Gold", as they call it. I haven't tested it with Mandelin, Marquis either Mecke, but as only looks, taste and effects seems to be familiar. It was a pity although, that I took 0.6g per ~6 hour period. It was clearly to much for me, do not recommend for anyone: my head was hurting for the next two days, strange body heat, sweat, muscle weakness. I didn't do much for three days afterwards, two of them laying in the bed and only because of physical weakness. High was also not that good when took repeatedly, jaw tension appears to get from almost 0 after first 150mg dosage, going to third 230mg, when it sucks so much, that you better have something what to chew on!

My vendor had been sold out of MDAI for months, when it suddenly reappered again a few weeks ago, and I bought a bag. This is fine whity sparkly powder and is definitly MDAI just like the flaky sparkly white MDAI, this has a more chemical taste to it however. It is strong, however after a night up, taking ca. 3 x 300m over a eight hour period I am getting very dizzy to the point of fainting when I try to walk to and from the lue (it does as other MDAI I have experienced give you an urge too pee more than normal while second dose usually *fucks* up peeing, you feel like to really have to go while lying down, you get to the toilet and can hardly squeeze out, only to go back lying down again feeling like you are about to piss the pants again, dunno why there is a horizontal / vertical opposite effect on this urine issue) ... anyhow I wanted to comment on the very powerfull fainting effect I have gotten after the stuff is broken down (and I feel a bit depressed and quite angsty). I literally had to grab hold and at one point did fall down while my vision blurred out totally, at one point I must have fainted as I felt disoriented at where I was - in my own bathroom. The fainting effect and dizzyness only happens when I try to walk, as if it is a lack of oxygen, my heart maybe not pumping fast enough for walking. I tried drinking some Orange Juice twice thinking it could be a bloodglucose defiency, but I still get the fainting dizzyness. It is worth noting I am on 15mg Zopiclone, but I have a high treshold and tolerance for Zopiclone after having used it for a year, still no other MDAI has made me this dizzy even with higher dosages of Zopiclone after. ... I have no abnormal effect while lying resting and can focus well on the computer. Plausible cause(s)? (I do however have a feeling it is not fatal or damage as I think/feel sleeping a nights sleep will turn me back to normal). And yeah going to sleep after MDAI is next to impossible - easier while on it! Update: I know think it is because I took way to many antihistamines when I was having an allergic asthmatic fit earlier on.

I found and old batch of the chocolate like mdai from a now defunct popular vendor. Tried 100mg a few times. Subtle mood lift, little anti depressive effect. No noticeable sides. Would like to try a higher dose + some eph to see if it's really as good as some make it out to be.

Tried a few more times, with and without eph.


Eph mostly overpowers it so the mdai isn't that noticable.


Higher dose (about 170mg) on it's own = good for talking about your feelings, really lets you open up much easily. Still no sides.


Probably going to take the last I have today, but I think it's only about 50mg or so.


Not planning on buying any more atm.

(1) What would be a good starting dose of MDAI for my first time? I'll probably be having some ethylphenidate as well. Would this combo be similar to MDMA?


(2)Also, what would be considered a strong dose


(3) and the most a person could have in one night?


(4) is it possible to re-dose throughout the night?

1 - A good recreational dose is around 170-250mg. The combo would make it similar but nothing like MDMA really.


2 - Anything above 200mg if you don't have a tolerance


3 - I wouldn't do more than 350mg in one night. The less you binge, the more you preserve the magic.

Hi all - just thought I should copy this over from BDD. Any help much appreciated. Ta!


    Good Mornin BL & GL. Hope everyone's ok.


    I'm looking at doing some first-time experiments with EPA, MDAI and Etizolam.


    Looking at forums etc makes me think that these are much stronger than Mephedrone - which was my last RC in 2010. I was frequently boshing 1-3gs of that but that doesn't look wise with the above! Probably wasn't wise with Meph either but there you go.


    Anyway, from research online, I'm reckoning allergy test with about 5mg of each. Then a first dose of approx. 20-25mg EPA with 50mg MDAI insufflated. I anticipate re-dosing similar amounts (perhaps a bit more of the MDAI) a few hours later. I know I won't sleep until next morning - that's fine.


    The 1mg Etiz tabs are for chilling/sleeping later - 1-2 once effects are properly fading.


    I have been prone to some anxiety in the past when coming up on new RCs (somewhat a hangover from a bad acid trip 15+ years ago) - so my 2 questions are:


    1) Do my doses look reasonable or will the EPA overpower the MDAI?

    2) Does anyone reckon half an Etiz (0.5mg) beforehand, possibly plugged, might help avoid jitters or is that unwise?


    Any help much appreciated - will post report after next weekend (2nd-3rd Dec).


    :D

A good oral dose for me is 250mg MDAI + 50mg MPA. Nowhere near overwhelming but extremely fun, and felt very close to MDMA. You could try to extrapolate a snorting dose from this, but I think I read somewhere that MDAI snorted isn't very pleasant.

Thanks for the reply. 


Sounds like you're quite experienced with these two. Having not tried before I might start a bit smaller, but the proportion gives me something to go on. 


Are MPA and EPA similar? I heard there was some difference...

200mg MDAI + 40mg MPA would put your mind more at peace, and still be very good. This is orally, by the way, so insufflated would require smaller dosing (but similar proportions).

Yeah, that's probably a good proportion. It is Ethylphenidate not MPA that I'll have as well as MDAI so I'll report in this thread and the EPH one. I know these substances are kinda old news now but it's good to keep an eye on how products are performing. Any ideas on the Etizolam question? Is anyone aware of problems with a small anti-anxiety dose (0.5mg-1mg) before going for these MDAI and EPH?

I'd just take half a pill to a whole pill if and when you become anxious.

Hi Kingme - I don't know if I'll encounter anxiety as it's my first time with it - and it's together with Ethylphenidate which I've heard can be edgy with some people. I have a history of getting jittery on the come-up with stims, which I used to smash with booze. But you know... I'm a bit older and wonder if my body can take 8 tins of stella as well as the stims! Probably could, but don't want to risk it. 


Based on reports, you're right - MDAI alone is generally a feelgood drug.

Can't find mdai on FDA site, so maybe they're overlooking it at present... can't be sure though.

Sounds great! Ok, what do you reckon: Last time I had rcs was over two years ago, when Mephedrone was still legal. Did quite a lot of that over 12 months. With this combo am I looking at something in the same league as Meph? 


Reports suggest that re-dosing should be less often and is less compulsive. I'm guessing it won't produce the same manic self-interest, but will be a touch more tame. And the big one of course: what about the sex? With Meph... well, you know - it was borderline insane in a REALLY good way (apart from the occasional shrinkage!) Do Ethylphenidate + MDAI in anyone's experience produce anything  good sex-wise?

@movem - I agree with the poster that no anxiety is present with MDAI. My experience with MDAI is that it's very underrated but also not as strong as a high that some people are looking for.


Anyway, I would say the effects are noticeable but the effects are "low key." There is no stimulation involved and I would say its more of a mental/psychological high than that of a body high. The effects for me include: euphoria, ego-softening, very strong empathgenic effects (closeness, lovey doves feeling, feeling more open, etc), a bit more talkative and social, body tingles, heightened senses (which include enhanced colors, clear crisp music). I also had sex on MDAI and it felt better: harder to achieve orgasm (I am female). I feel very "one" with my boyfriend while having sex with him, very in-tune with each other. In also did not have any trouble sleeping on it, after about 4 hours the effects waned...and as they did I had more of a relaxed feeling wash over me which made it easy to sleep. The effects are harder to notice when you are out such as bar because I think it has stronger empathgenic effects than anything. It has no stimulation at all so I would add some stimulant for more of an MDMA type feel.


Does anyone know how your brain would react taking MDAI after a night of MDMA?

Hi Parachute


Thanks for the info - much appreciated. Some info says MDAI both releases serotonin and inhibits dopamine reuptake. This could be kind of therapeutic, I guess, but I don't know how much so after a night on the MDMA. Probably depends on MDMA's mechanism. Clearly I'm no neurologist (!) but if I was considering it, I would be careful to confirm that I'm not doing more of the same to my brain, but something different instead.


Thanks again for the info. Anyone else get jiggy on MDAI + Ethylphenidate combined?

Also - yeah I was wondering the effects of MDAI after MDMA because it could help with the hangover of MDMA? But I don't want serotonin syndrome nor do I want to over do it. I am not neurologist either but would the effects of MDAI (serotonin release) help lift your mood the day after MDMA just like taking 5-HTP? I really have no clue on the subject except some basic ideas on it. Any info would be appreciated. 


Ps. I didn't try any ethyl + MDAI.

That's just what I'm thinking. 5-htp to my understanding acts as a therapeutic serotonin production enhancer. MDAI however is stated as not only doing that, but also acting as a reuptake inhibitor for seretonin, norepinephrine and dopamine. So its action is a bit more mental. I'm only getting the technical stuff off wikipedia by the way! 


With my limited knowledge, I would avoid using MDAI therapeutically, as it seems to be more on the recreational side so has more pronounced effects. Although toxicity is low, I am guessing there may be a risk of psychosis. Your point about serotonin syndrome may well be valid. 


Anyone else got any thoughts on this...?

You know, I've been reading a lot about MDAI. Lots of people talk about feeling chilled, ego-free and smiley, positive feeling. That's fine. What I'm not hoping for is this 'one with the universe' deep and meaningful stuff that some people have written about. I did all that with acid and smoking when I was younger! 


I think nowadays I'm thoughtful and philosophical enough when I'm straight. I'm getting high *ahem*...researching... for excitement and interest - not meditation. I really hope that works out! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Reckon I might end up having a couple of beers with my preliminary 1/2mg of etizolam. Bit of a cocktail though isn't it... moderate amounts, I reckon.

Think of MDMA without ANY stimulant properties with lessened visual effects (although still there). That to me is what MDAI feels like. MDAI is for a night of chilling IMO.

NO. The last thing you want during an MDMA hangover is more serotonin release. That would lead to additional depletion of serotonin, despite taking 5-HTP. 5-HTP will raise your serotonin levels very temporarily. The thing is, when you release that much serotonin, you get an overexpression of MAO, which destroys serotonin. The more serotonin you release, the more MAO will be produced, leading to the immediate destruction of the meager amounts of serotonin left in your neurons. Plus, taking more serotonin releasers will cause a dysfunction of the enzymes responsible for producing serotonin such as Tryptophan Hydroxylase.


What you really want to do during an MDMA hangover is take 5-HTP in combination with a Green Tea extract, eat healthy and sleep. Taking MDAI will just make you feel worse afterwards.

Also, serotonin syndrome is the exact opposite of what will happen during a hangover. Hangovers feel like shit because you're not getting ENOUGH serotonin release, whereas serotonin syndrome happens when you get TOO MUCH serotonin release, such as when you take way too much MDMA, especially with an MAOI like PMA or PMMA or the 2C-T's.

I haven't used MDMA and MDAI in such a short timespan, but I have tried MDAI two days in a row and I definetly felt depressed after. When it wasn't over after 3days I used 7mg Methoxetamine and all was back to normal. I didn't use a SRA for a while after that though.


MDAI may be non-neurotoxic but it is still a powerful Serotonin Releasing Agent.

I normally feel like crap after MDMA but I used MDAI and had no ill effects, I also used precaution by preloading on some vitamins and taking 5-HTP the next couple of days.

Ah! Hedonism! that's what I like to hear. My universal oneness is when I'm, like, normal. IMO, you can't be deep and high at once - the two words are exact opposites!

Well, that MDAI stuff is rather good innit! However, I used it alongside alcohol & ethylphenidrate. So which effects were due to what substance is a bit wooly. But an educated guess should be close. It's all in the forums. I should point out that many believe it's really not a good idea to mix rcs before at least trying them individually. This is probably true, but Friday nights aren't my strong spot for good ideas!


What interests me is that I actually found the MDAI to sting more up the nose than the Eth. I think it was because the Eth was a fine powder, while the MDAI needed lots of chopping. It looked like ground up crystals - which is probably because it was, I'm guessing, made of ground up crystals. 


Anyway, I'm about 3 years late on trying this so anything report-wise has already been said. The only thing I would say is if you get that kind of crystalline powder, it's well worth chopping each dose for several minutes before snorting. Obviously, if you're not snorting then happy days. In the past I just used a bank card for chopping, but this time I found a stanley knife blade and it worked much better. 


Last week I expressed concern about some bloggers, posters etc remarking about MDAI that it took you on a meaningful mental journey, or that it creates some kind of deeper sense of oneness. I do of course accept that when trying a new substance you have to be prepared for anything. But I'm pleased to report that nothing of the sort occurred. I had no unusual urges to do anything except talk a bit more than normal and smoke cigarettes. It was just a good weekend. I felt it was surprisingly close overall to the effects of mephedrone, except that I could not retain tumescence for more than about 25 seconds. With Meph it was at least a minute and a half.

So after several times experimenting with MDAI and in combination with MPA, I found 250mg MDAI + 50mg MPA to be my best experience so far. MDAI by itself is VERY sedating to myself and to those who took it with me. 250mg MDAI + 50mg MPA feels very close to MDMA, but any less MDAI and it feels slightly underwhelming (but still good).

Did anyone try do dissolve the new white and powdery UK Batch in water? I will try MDAI next weekend for my first time in order to check it out for New Years Eve and I like to adjust my doses closely via volumetric dosing.


Also is 100mg a good starting dose for someone who is sensitive to MDMA etc?

Thanks.

100mg is a light dose, you are likely to be underwhelmed. 150mg is more adequate.

ill be trying this for  the first time soon, i have  500mgs in the post along with 500mgs ethylphenidate, and  of course some etizolams for the comedown. just a couple of Q's..


i am very experienced when  it comes  to mdma, 6apb, 5apb, meph etc, just wondering a good starting dose? i'd rather be overwhelmed than underwhelmed. also what would you recommend with the ethylphenidate dosing wise? dont want to be too speedy as i will most likley be just sat in. dont want  to fall asleep either haha.


how long does mdai last for?


re-dosing an option? or just not worth it

If you're experienced with these other entactogens, MDAI is likely to be an underwhelming experience. You probably have a considerable amount of tolerance, so 200mg is probably an adequate amount. Not sure about the ethylphenidate.


I usually find MDAI to be more therapeutic than recreational. Threshold doses (< 30mg) make for an excellent anti-depressant.

I agree that 200mg MDAI is a good first dose, although 250mg if you're confident about getting right in there. I can't comment about the ethylphenidate dosage I'm afraid, but 50mg MPA oral was a good mixer.

Does anyone have further information towards solubility of MDAI? If it arrives today or tomorrow I will also start with 200mg but it would just be good to know if it is possible to dilute. Thanks.

ok so thinking back to that night i wasnt really "trippin" per say, it was more a delirium, kept thinking i was talking to with people talking to them, then i'd snap out of it and think wtf? but it would keep happening, also it got to a point where i was seriously nodding, anyone else experienced this?


im thinking i was just so heavily sedated, 230mg bombed and 270mgs snorted, with 2mg etizolam and plenty of weed

Using MDAI after MDAI really does multiply the depression (and anxiety that follows with depression) and I really do not advice it, 5-HTP is converted to serotonin in the brain, but does not replenish the brains own serotonin, 5-HTP effects last for about four hours and takes one hour onset, the biosynthess of neurovasicle serotonin takes seven days from the amino acid tryptophan, so perhaps taking a larger dose of tryptophan seven days prior to MDAI will calm the next seven days of depression that follows a SRA (Serotonin Realising Agent).

I would be very interested in reports from people testing the white, shiny, almost silvery and sparkly (when held against a light) powdered stuff they sell currently in the UK as MDAI. 

I took some yesterday and am not convinced if it is MDAI after reading through all these pages of this thread and others. 

I did not take anything else with it but I drank alcohol throughout the night.

I started with a few grains under my tongue at midnight, then orally 10mg and waited for an hour. Then took 50mg, after half an hour another 50mg. At this point i definitely felt a mood-lift, very positive, but nothing like MDMA. Very mild euphoria but also very awake. Still clear-headed (apart from the effects of alcohol). No visuals.

I go out and make the usual mistake of taking the entire bag with me, so i snort some in the toilet, approx. 50mg (a wild guess). This does not hurt at all up my nose. I take more blows for the next hours, at least 4 more and am out till 11am. It's fiendish and I don't want to stop. I finally go home and take 1mg of Etizolam and pass out very quickly and sleep properly for 6 hours.

I weighed the bag before and after and took around 400mg of the powder.

Comedown next day isn't great at first but food and then 2 beers help a lot and now I'm quite fine and relaxed and comfortable listening to music.

It was actually a quite nice experience with currently no obvious bad side effects.

your report sounds in line with what an MDAI experience would be at those doseages... so i would say you more than likely have MDAI.

what is the best way to use mdai? insufflate/ use it orally (drop it inside a rizla) or what?

i will be getting my mdai NOT from uk but from EU mainland

what is the best dose for first time user who is on 120ml methadone/day and hasnt used RC's at all.

ive only had methylphenidate but that was long time ago. this time i plan on using just the MDAI, nothing else, even though i will also be getting 6-apb and MDPV.


for me, personally, just dropping it inside a rizla paper and then bombing it sounds like the best idea and i like it the best too. no tasting it or anything just T+0:00 and here we go ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oral is the way to go with MDAI, it has poor nasal bioavailability and stings like fuck when snorted.

Yes. In general, most entactogens are best absorbed orally, whether in a capsule or parachuted.

Latest MDAI doing the rounds seems a bit suspect to be honest. A lot of it seems overly powdery, whereas it should be crystalline. Even if it had been ground down, I would still expect it to have more of a sparkly quality than it actually does. The taste and effects are slightly off as well. Don't have any reagent tests at the moment but it would be useful if someone did.


Go easy, guys. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a lot of impure or different stuff being sold as MDAI right now, given the recent, seemingly worldwide, shortage.

I'm gonna receive some of this new batch soon and will report after the initial test. But I haven't done MDAI before so I can't compare it to the pre 2010 stuff.

Still don't know if it is soluble in water though...

I have tried many different types of MDAI over the years and the tan powder was excellent, far better than the white crystalline stuff around now.  I had full on eye wobbles, jaw clench the lot.


Once I got sent a batch that were semi translucent 'shards' with a hint of tan to there colour.  They were like fish flakes in texture and a gram looked more like 10 because it was so light.  It wasn't around long but was easily as good as (if not better) than any MDAI i'VE EVER HAD. Any one else seen this?

Not similar at all. MDAI releases only serotonin, while MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. MDAI is MDMA without the super pushy energy/euphoria.

Yeah, it'll really only give you the empathy and general feeling of content.


That said, it's very clean (highly selective) so it works well in combinations that otherwise lack any serotonin involvement, many of which will give you at least an approximation of an MDMA high.

But an educated guess should be close. It's all in the forums. I should point out that many believe it's really not a good idea to mix rcs before at least trying them individually. This is probably true, but Friday nights aren't my strong spot for good ideas!

The only thing I would say is if you get that kind of crystalline powder, it's well worth chopping each dose for several minutes before snorting. Obviously, if you're not snorting then happy days. In the past I just used a bank card for chopping, but this time I found a stanley knife blade and it worked much better.

I had no unusual urges to do anything except talk a bit more than normal and smoke cigarettes. It was just a good weekend. I felt it was surprisingly close overall to the effects of mephedrone, except that I could not retain tumescence for more than about 25 seconds. With Meph it was at least a minute and a half.

lol thought this was commonly known as a much quicker technique then chopping: Press your creditcard face down firmly into your pile of shards, and rub it back and forth a bit. Put some muscle into it for best results. It will probably be pancaked to the surface/card now, so use another card to scrape the remains off your card and then off whatever surface you used again, so you get a pile.  This technique has always yeilded me the fluffiest of powders, I can't imagine trying to actually just chop up shards.


The only chopping I do is to refluff up the pancaked powder.

QFT


Although I always end up needing 3 cards, the third one is used to get the rest of the powder of the second card. Doing it in a folded note of piece of paper is useful for containing the powder if your crushing up big crystals that will go flying across the room.

Methinks MDAI has much therapeutic potential, as long as used in very small dosages and very infrequently as an instant antidepressant.

MDMA causes a comedown because the serotonergic toxicity induces a shutting down of adjacent neurones to protect your brain as well as inhibiting enzymes involved in producing serotonin. This does not occur with MDAI hence reduced comedown.

For the record, I found (100mgs orally in water, empty stomach) of MDAI very slightly empathogenic & slightly stimulating. No-where near as good as MDMA, MDA, 6-APB, 5-APB.

Unsurprising for it is a pretty low dose. Maybe not for the compounds you are comparing to, but it is for MDAI.


Also I don't think it was ever claimed to be stimulating or similar to MDMA or close relatives.


Comedowns from what I can tell seem to be more apparent from catecholamine depletion and SERT rape. With serotonin depletion it seems to take longer to manifest as mental health symptoms, but I have this feeling that when you do feel it your problems can be very chronic.

Could you please translate for the layman (i.e. me). I have little chemistry background. Cheers.


And yes, comparing MDAI to the other stuff might seem uncharitable, but I'm just lumping it in with other phenethylamines.


What oral doses tend to be effective? 200mgs?

Well I don't know how many types of serotonin depletion there are because it is stored in different places e.g. vesicles, mitochondria, maybe the cytosol (that is probably more of a medium) but it is just my observation that drugs with differing actions have different tendencies to produce comedowns, and maybe different kinds of comedowns. In a minute I will also venture the guess that there are some more complex kinetics at work that show the transience of acute aftereffects to be a bad indication for chronic aftereffects.


To me it felt like MDAI together with dopamine/norepinephrin releasers resembled MDMA but even with seriously increased dosage there is some quality to MDMA that is missing with purely releasing mimics. Even considerably more than reuptake inhibition (which doesn't necessarily seems to cause disastrous symptoms - for example I certainly don't find MPH to be more hardcore than amphetamine, both in terms of effect as well as aftereffect) my inference is that this is the way MDMA "rapes" SERT that produces both that finishing touch of magic as well as a harsh comedown when increasing dose or frequency past some point.


For the laymen: SERT is the serotonin transporter that facilitates reuptake (recycling) of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. By rape I mean that MDMA reverses the action of SERT to pump out serotonin. So the very system that is supposed to keep levels in check a bit is abused to help dump serotonin stores. AFAIK, MDAI doesn't do this to SERT... and it is an example of how MDAI does not simply have the pure and isolated serotonergic effect of MDMA.


MDMA shows its potential to cause a comedown overtly IME, especially when used beyond the responsible...

Other drugs or combinations might mimic MDMA but lack some magic, and they *might* also lack *some* of the comedown or chronic aftereffects.


With MDAI in my opinion it doesn't feel like the acute after effects are proportionate to how much serotonin was released, but as a rule I never trust in drugs to be a wonder compound that lets you get away with it. That is why I said those things about the sneaky form of chronic effects. I *think* that even if levels are restored quickly to some point I would absolutely not be surprised if they don't reach the full 100% anymore and this effect may add up until you start to realize that.


Furthermore serotonin depletion without depletion of the catecholamines (such as dopamine and NE) seems to have more subtle direct symptoms like feeling a bit emotionally hollow but often not actively shitty and demotivated. Symptoms of multiple monoamine depletion is probably 'synergistic'.


We must remember that it can be very hard to connect subjectively experienced symptoms to pharmacology, most importantly that a crash does not prove neurotoxicity (even if it does correlate to depletion) and neurotoxic effects don't always have to be directly apparent (which is why I was personally very worried about 4-BMC making its appearance on the RC scene).


And please don't confuse my theories with fact, I try as best as possible to indicate which I offer.

Hahaha, raincheck.


Anyway I liked MDAI, though the type that is sitting in my stash 'cabinet' is the brown product contaminated with safrole. With dextroamphetamine it felt relatively clean in effect but it is not the sort of thing I would want for a special 'balls to the wall' tripping and/or clubbing occasion. Neither do I feel like I would fiend on it (compulsion seems to be more of a dopamine thing), but I doubt I want to take MDAI again if I don't want to take other stims to go with it. It does feel gentle, sensitive and smooth but that isn't *that* much to go on by itself. 

To me AMT feels kindred, distinctly serotonergic and I tend to fall asleep on both while in pleasurable trance.


AMT is actually quite a special drug IMO because it is a great and long experience but the aftereffects are mostly glowing rather than crashy. I must research its pharmacology some more, I think it was gradual non-selective serotonin reuptake inhibition that makes it special, and next to it there is some moderate and tempered serotonin release. Not sure about other effects, there must be some dopaminergic... but thats another topic with another thread.


Uhhhh yeah I feel ya on the sleep deprivation, right now I am not sure if I should sustain a bad rhythm or pull an all-nighter.

^ aMT is my all time favourite drug so I'd personally say you're missing out but I'm okay with longer trips - if you find them tiring then it might not be all that enjoyable to you, particularly as the trip drags on, since aMT makes me very tired towards the end especially. You could try vaporising it though, it gets rid of the nasty come up nausea that I get with oral freebase, makes for even more heightened pleasure, a significantly lower dose is required, and best of all for me the effects only last about 6-7 hours rather than the 16 hours from an oral dose :D


That said, it's interesting that we're talking about it here in the MDAI thread, because while vaporising aMT works for the purpose of reducing the duration, I always wondered about creating a similar experience that was also a lot shorter than oral aMT using a combo. My idea was always a 4-substituted tryptamine (i.e. Psilocin, Psilocybin, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-AcO-DMT etc) along with MDAI/IAP/similar SSRA - aMT always reminded me somewhat of 4-sub tryps and DMT but at a lower dose and with the lovely serotonin warmth poured on top, so I feel a combo like this might be fairly close to its effects (though of course unique).

What makes you say that? That MDAI is selective doesn't mean it is inactive peripherally. And bruxism comes from certain effects on serotonin levels but it may not be exclusive to that, considering dopaminergic drugs can also cause quite a lot of it.

Virtually all of that also applies to the nystagmus.

I just think they are side-effects that reflect large changes (mostly drops) in serotonin levels, maybe in that sense similar yet opposite to brain zaps.


I understand your apprehension regarding AMT but it was discussed (probably in the main thread) that serotonin depletion is relatively less serious in total compared to MDMA despite the longer duration. I'm not quite sure how this was compared but it seems credible.


Thanks for keeping an eye on being on topic, together with me.

My g-friend reminded me of doing 250mg MDAI & that it was warm and open - but the doses aren't economical (for my wallet, anyway). After this reminder, I reverse my decision to give up on MDAI.


aaah... like a pig in a candy store ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Thanks for the education.

aMT is life changing. I have always had anxiety about death but now I can think about it peacefully, and generally most things that made me anxious or worried before are not as much of a problem anymore. I'd say it's had the biggest impact on my life by far of all drugs I've tried. That being said, I haven't tried LSD, DMT, or shrooms (yet) but after reading claims that aMT is like LSD + MDMA, my expectations of LSD can't be far off.


MDAI requires at least 250mg for me to have a worthwhile experience, and that's only if I add a little mpa/eth into the mix. 6-APB is far superior, requiring 150mg, but my last roll at 200mg was incredible.

From my own entirely personal experience, I completely disagree. AMT is just an interesting and pleasant chemical. It has not changed my life, except to add pleasure to it. However, if you're at a point in life where this might somehow help, I'm sure that can happen. Just wanted to counter-balance the jejune "the trips really changed me" talk I read/hear.

Yes, serotonin release causes jaw tension and thus possibly bruxism.

Thanks guys. I was just begining to wonder if it wasn't rather dpoamine that caused bruxism with MDMA, and not serotonin.


I guess we an rule that out.

I've probably used this substance more than most. Gone through over 15 grams with friends over three last year

 I will write up a comprehensive trip report. 


And as for bruxism. SE causes muscle tension and NE drives movement. Together they cause a sensation of unresolved muscle potential and I suspect since most users are also talking a lot then it is expressed through the jaw. Clenching your fists over and over will reduce the desire to Gurn.

So I finally tried this yesterday at 100mg (the new white-cristally batch) and I am very pleased with the effects even at that small dose. I am somewhat a lightweight when it comes to psychedelics.

No dose will ever feel like MDMA. Pushing it higher will not solve that. The issue is that MDMA also releases DA and NE in high concentrations which MDAI does not.

250mg MDAI + 50mg MPA/ETH = no brainer. Felt very similar to MDMA, and I would've believed it to be MDMA in a blind trial.

You could always split the MPA dose and take more as required; if you're not comfortable at the thought of going straight for 100mg MPA (!).

well got my mpa mdai combo this morning just dropped 250mg mdai and 150mg mpa as iv got a stupid tolarance to mpa so hopefully give it an hour and we will see . the mdai is a very fine white powder bit like salt no really shine or sparkle to it . 


also i tried to vape a tiny bit but it just turned black so that dont work ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Edit: ok that was more fail than success do not why just did not really get going think its because iv sort of hit a maintenance level with my in take need longer clean or bigger does and before people start about the bigger dose iv been basically abusing stims all most daily for 8 years so my tolerance is stupidly high . 


have found one way to get a nice buzz off it though snorting the mdai gives a bit of an mdma/lsd style rushes for a few minutes . think i'll get another gram in a fortnight when i get a bigger stash of other things to mix with it like a smoke/blend/noid and some other stim instead of mpa maybe even try some acid with it as the buzz from snorting would go really nice with a good tab ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


right i really don't not like this the other week , the all most instant suicidal tendency were unbelievable . but iv just been offered a combo for free which is a benzocaine mdai one and wondered what people thought of the mix ? .


i know benzocaine is shite really and to me so was mdai only reason i'm considering taking it/ doing it is the persons chemicals are normally above the normal retail gear so i may get lucky with this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


and this time iv got it in the right thread instead of the amt one i posted in Earlie like a total spaz

I bought a gram November 2010 and kept it in the ziplock bag it came in, in the fridge. This newyear me and my GF took a dose and it was as good as ever. 


Since then I keep it in the fridge in a glass vial. I did this because someone said (in the Big and Dandy storage thread, if I remember correctly) that after some time (a few years would be my guess), the ziplock back could start to break down, causing it to mix with the compound. Anyway it didn't happen with my batch after 2 years, but better safe than sorry !


I don't think degradation is such a huge issue with this compound. Although I'm not sure.

Glass would make sense, you never know how this stuff will react with all the different kinds of plastic.


I once stored some GBL in a plastic container, but the liquid ate through it and leaked.

Fuck! How long quickly did it eat through it? I've got some indetified GHB/GBL I mean its one or the other, I've been keeping it in a normal plastic bottle of the coca-cola variety, it's been a couple months and it's still in tact, guessing I got GHB then?

As far as I know, GBL is always liquid.


The GBL ate through the plastic in a matter of hours.


transformedit: GBL must be stored in PE (milk jugs). PET will be attacked by it and you probably don't want the plasticisers leaching in or any leakage as a result. Please stay on topic ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hi welcome to Bluelight / PD,


thanks for the compact report, we typically encourage actual reports to be posted in the Trip Reports forum but I am sure people will appreciate you describing the effects here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I think I agree with you for the most part, compared to other drugs it is indeed lacking and what is lacking is activity on dopamine and norepinephrin. People can get pretty hyped about serotonin and yes it is an important component but since dopamine is involved with reward, it is understandable that MDAI can be lovey-dovey without actually feeling like it is rewarding.

You can find your way around by just going to the Bluelight homepage (click on the big banner that says Bluelight at the top, or the button that says home) and navigating using the menu, should be pretty intuitive, just have a looksee.


Please note that when you post a trip report there you use the appropriate format as the thread title. The format is: (Substance / Dose) - Exp Level - Creative Title

So in your case something like (MDAI / 500 mg) - First Time - A nice and secure Volvo car

(lol)

^ Nice report, thanks.


Been reading that MDAI typically requires x2 than, say, MDMA, but 500mg is quite a bit more than that....

MDAI

150g oral gel-cap, empty stomach

feel slight mood lift

50mg half-hour later

50mg another half-hour later

slight stimulation

probably need to do more all in one go


Also did the same dose & timing with **methylone** & got the same result.


Both were tested with a kit & measured on a scale.

Methylone is far more potent and powerful I think. Also I could easily sleep after methylone whilst with mdai I have fucked up feels like I'm awake but I'm actually asleep, sleep.

Tried MDAI a few times and actually liked it. It's not MDMA but it does encourage talking about ones deepest emotions. The only strange thing that happened while using it (and only 150mg) was a few minutes of hallucinations similar to normal psys only less intense.

5 days (the post came the day after the trip). Yes, probably not enough time - but I'm not sure what enough time is. Waiting another month feels like too long.

Anyone tried MDAI & Ethylphenidate combo.. im assuming its non neurotoxic and the Ethylphenidate would make up for the lack of dopamine but without being DA releasing and thus potentially toxic.

I think if you're low on serotonin you'll go down rather than up.

Hi guys. I was wondering if MDAI and 5-APB would prove to be a good combo? Or perhaps potentially dangerous? I'm getting some MDAI soon and have leftover 5-APB, was considering maybe like a 50-65 mg MDAI with 50 mg 5-APB.


Has anyone tried this or like to shed some light on the combo? I realize both compounds are serotinin releasers but maybe combined in these low doses I could get the best of both worlds?  Thanks.

I got something similar with MDAI (don't remember the dose any more, but it was bellow 300mg) once - breathing walls and things like that. Only lasted around 10 minutes.

I personally wouldn't. You said it yourself that 5-APB is already a serotonin releasing agent so what are you really looking to add by using MDAI as well? Serotonin syndrome is no fun!

put it away after my trial runs a time back

took two 50mg piles under the tongue, just add a slight prickle to the skin, stim, or glow


just a regular night of buds, bars and brews, really. slight stim'd head and relaxed body


from what i've researched from experiences, it still lacks an dopey edge, people like to combine amphetamines whilst.

for more of a euphoric rush i guess


its good enough to me for what it is, not much, not on the list at really.

would never take it out clubbing or something much prefer methylone or random accumulated batches of mdxx

I wanted to try one of these M&M pellets but the dosage doesn't seem right to me. A popular vendor posted this on his site - 


"The latest formula has been tweaked and contains methiopropamine and MDAI.


100mg N-methyl-1-(thiophen-2-yl)propan-2-amine and 50mg 5,6-Methylenedioxy-2-Aminoindane are in each research pellet."


Doesn't 100mg of MPA seem too much, but the MDAI dose seems too little?

You're probably better off buying both compounds separately and mixing them at a ratio that's best for you.

I would but MDAI is pretty expensive and you need at least 200mg for any decent effect.

Hey there.


I need to know what your question is so I can move your thread to the appropriate forum. If you want peoples thoughts on what you should do if you feel your health is at risk, well, there's only one answer: visit the emergency room, or call an ambulance. In the mean time, if you have benzodiazepines on hand, feel free to take some.


Hope you're alright.

Hello There, Thank you, I suppose I was looking for reassurance and query if this had happened to others (I have actually managed to find a thread buried here deep somewhere here from the UK with two different cases of this purple/numbness eek) 

Pink Panther (mix of MDAI and 2AI thread if you know how to connect them!! I know how ridiculous this will sound but I generally don't fuck about with my health...More research and I suspect I won't try these again...hopefully we all live to tell the tale. On that chirpy note. Thanks all.

I am not a doctor and don't know what to make of your symptoms. I suggest you visit one if you experience any adverse effects persisting more than a couple hours. Unfortunately if you don't know what you took it's not going to be possible for us to do any better.


In the meantime, I suggest consuming plenty of water and salt, typical recovery stuff for binges e.g. orange juice.

Until I was about 15 I was in the MDAI state all the time. Then it disappeared and I'm now being treated for depression. I was always trying to find a name for this sensation but no one knew what I was talking about. People say MDAI feels different every time. It was the same for me when I was younger. Every few weeks, the whole sensation changed into something completely new, but it was strangely the same basic sensation. I'm guessing I have depression now because this was so strongly present when I was a kid. Too much down-regulation. Did anyone else feel like they were constantly in this state of mind as kids? I suspect most people are to some degree.


Also, I achieved the same state by taking 60 milligrams of mirtazapine, which is an antagonist and reverse agonist for several serotonin receptor types.

So I've done MDAI with MPA both together, but I did MDAI bombs and the MPA was either snorted or plugged. I've been wondering what's the best ROA for MDAI with MPA added? Also, is 250mg (MDAI) and 100mg (MPA) a good dosage for best combination feel?

Okay so I had my first exp with the new crystally white batch from a uk vendor and had a great time I took 130mgs at the tail end of my kratom trip and by the time the mdai kicked in the kratom experience was over. That 130mgs felt like about 60mgs mdma, in fact very identical and if i bought it as MDMA and I was at a rave I would've mistaken it for a low dose molly. Just less euphoria and push but I was very chatty. 


Overall I found this chem a success and can definately see this chem as a sort of building block in creating an mdma like exp, just needs a lil umph from another chem. 


I was expecting a mellow smooth buzz but I found it just as stimmy as mdma which contradicts what ive read but anyways if felt good. About 2 1/2 hours into the trip i took my daily dose of kratom and I found it to truely round out the exp very well and I regret not taking the both together. 


So here's my question, whats the tolerance buildup with this substance? I wanna take the same dose tommorow at the same time as my morning kratom dose. Will I feel the mdai or do I really have to wait a month like mdma? I mean the stuff is non-neurotoxic so it shouldn't be dangerous but how reduced will the effects be? Also from what I read 130mgs is a low-ish dose but then again I felt great so there must've been some depletion. Im sure some of you UK stim bingers have dosed multiple days in a row, am I just setting myself for week long depression?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT: So looking back on it im really beginning to question if what I had was MDAI. It was purchased from a popular UK site that I should've been a lil wary of due to the fact they sold brand name blends and such. The site had 2 types of MDAI, chinese and indian. The indian was more expensive and all they had so I purchased a gram of that and it arrived along with some AMT and 5-meo-dalt.


Anyways yesterdays experience was good overall but pretty different from other MDAI experiences. I took 130mgs weighed out and effects were apparent an hour later. It felt identical to an mdma come-up and by about an hour and a half in I felt very stimmy, chatty, and euphoric. Basically felt like a low-ish/medium dose of mdma WITH all the euphoria. It came down after about 6 hours and I had to take some etiz to relax cuz I felt very jittery. 


Anyways When the etiz wore of I was STILL stimmed out and had an increased heart-rate and insomnia 10 hours past the time of ingestion.


From what I read I was expecting a mellow warm couchlock type high but felt a very stimmy euphoric high. My plans for laying on the couch and relaxing turned into me having to go blow of steam on my bmx at the local skatepark. Maybe they sent me that M&M bs or something because all I know is it was far from mellow. I know nobody knows what it is without a test kit but has anyone received this crystally, clumpy white powder with little rocks in it and had the same experience? 


Maybe I'm just sensitive to the stuff, I never take stims and I hate em. They always keep me up and make my chest beat a mile a minute, and not to mention they make me very confused and this MDAI sure gave me that MDMA confusion.

—------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Another edit: I stupidly decided to give this fake MDAI another go thinking if I plugged it things would go smoother, I plugged 90mgs around noon so even if it fucked me over again I wouldn't lose a whole nights sleep. So 20 mins later I thought "damn this feels REALLY good but again it was very stimmy which I dont like, I hate stims besides MDMA and coke. 


After two hours I came down HARD, worst than the first time. This comedown felt very dangerous, This time I had heart palpitations, irregular heartbeat, debilitating nausea, crushing depression, extreme lethargy, headache and everytime I got out of bed to go pee I became dangerously lightheaded and my heart started to pound, even if I took my time getting up. I was completely bed ridden. I will never take this shit again. Once again I was twacked to the gills for like 12 hours. 


From what I read MDAI was mild, sedating, and subtle unless combined with a stim.... especially considering what I took was considered a low dose. If I would've added any sort of stim I prolly would've died or at the least ended up hospitalized. Has anyone consumed this piece of shit being passed off as indian mdai? My substance was a clumpy, white crystaline chem that smelled like bad breath. I'm curious to here others experiences with this poison being passed off as MDAI.

Looks like there is no MDAI available anymore and no prospect for another batch in the near future due to a lack of demand ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) . Really sucks, as this has been one of my favorite substances ever due to its lack of side effects and MDMA-like empathy/music appreciation.

Sounds like you got something else Captain! It's possible that, seeing the APB's have recently been permanently banned, that you've been sent some APB or MAPB type compound instead. The duration doesn't entirely make sense, but I'm at a loss to explain your experience otherwise.


I suggest you keep hold of whatever the fuck you've been sold & in some imaginary future, we might find a way to narrow down the ID of your material. I have been flogged some odd things in my time, both through the old internets as well as through real life sources. I've had cathinones as MDAI, mephedrone as MDMA etc etc. In the old days, if something didn't sit right with me, I'd destroy the compound in question, black-list the vendor & move on. But nowadays I'm more likely to keep any suspicious material to use as a cross reference in case something similar occurs. I'd advise you do the same, in the hope that more liberal times may be ahead & we might be free to have our purchases analysed properly!

One UK rc vendor promised more mdai a few months from now. Never bought anything from them so I have no idea how reliable that is.

Yeah I know for a fact what I took wasn't MDAI even though it wasn't tested (it was pretty obvious), the effects were polar opposites from real MDAI experiences. What I had was speedy, VERY long lasting, and incredibly active at the 100mg range. If I would've bombed 200mgs of that shit I would either have been dead or put in the hospital. The palpatations and lethargy caused by this poison was scary, not even 5mgs of etizolam put a dent into the stimulation or HR issues. 


I had no reagents at the time and couldn't have flushed it any quicker so I'm afraid I don't have anymore to test although I should've saved a small amount. I've taken APB's and those are nothing short of amazing, what I took felt like a coctail of dirty stims and cathinones. The actual 'high' lasted about 2-3 hours and the other 10+ hours was pure hell. I imagine that kinda comedown only comes after a heavy meth binge, needless to say I will never even try and seek out any MDAI ever again.

Yes, it is largely unavailable.  Its synthesis is more difficult than phenethylamine-skeleton compounds, many people were disappointed because they expected something closer to MDMA, and vendors started doing some shady shit once manufacturing of MDAI declined (eg, selling random cathinone mixes as MDAI, selling cut to shit MDAI as "double potency" by virtue of "specially modified molecules").

Such as shame this has almost disappeared! Although I hear a batch is in the process of being synthesised once again due to popular demand, but not in large quantities like before. A mellow worthwhile empathogen in its own right, and a down right messy sex crazed MDMA/meth style high when combined with either MPA or 2FA. The latter resulting in possibly one of the most intense aphrodisiacs I've ever tired. Are there any other prodominaltey SSRA out there akin to MDAI?

Has anyone successfully obtained MDAI recently (not looking for specific sources or anything)? I managed to find a fairly obscure vendor claiming to sell it and decided to take a punt, but I haven't had the courage to try it out yet (besides a tiny ~1mg allergy test) because I'm about 90% sure it's fake given the current scarcity. For what it's worth, what I received is an odorless white powder which likes to clump up and stick to itself. It's water soluble, but dissolves very slowly at room temp and forms needle like crystals after evaporation. In any case, I should have one of them EZ test kits arriving soon, so that'll hopefully put my suspicions at rest. I'm sure I'm not the only one interested to know whether any of the stuff that is currently in circulation is legit or not.

That's about the long and short of it - there is a market for it but many samples have been other things completely.

Bit late for you now, but I got some shady UK vendor's 'Indian MDAI' tested & it was a mix of methiopropamine and phenethylamine. It's not nice.

Definitely too late but that's good to know, I wonder if we got it from the same vendor. Does this vendor start with an S and sell branded chems alongside their regular compounds? I suspected it was MPA after doing some research not too long ago, and it sounds like a great candidate (though I will never know of course). My "MDAI" was a bright white and it was far more potent and longer lasting than it should have been, so it would make sense that 90mgs plugged with no tolerance would cause such intense and unpleasant effects. If it was cut with phenethylamine they sure didn't use enough to achieve similar doses to MDAI. Please know that I'm not asking for drug identification mods and you can take this post down if need be.

I suspect this dark brown 'MDAI' I have is genuine, if a bit impure, but I just did an 'allergy test' yesterday & it made my tongue tingle, it tastes slightly salty, but has a sweet sassafras smell. I'm not sure what the correct result would be from a reagent test kit, or if it'd be visible past the dark brown colour of the powder. I think it's time to use the (Welsh) government free drug testing service again & get a proper lab test done, I'll send WEDINOS a sample tomorrow. I only have a bit under a gram & I can't get any more, but with all the fake mdai around I should test it before trying anyway.

mdai that ive had a few times was always white super sparkley little crystals. although the high was not strong the effects were amazing. therapeutic, clean, no side effects, great for mind cleansing and its highly underrated in my opinion just because people dont get a strong high but its brilliant in other aspects.

Mdai almost got it, never went though with it though.   2010 was a big year if I remember right , with the non neutotoxic study.  I studied it well- stuff is clean, and yes empathy is there.  Im going by memory here,  Dr Dave (Nichols) created it.  Same guy who created 5-mapb and other empathogeons, brilliant man.   Stuff really isn't available from what I know

OK, it's available again. Certain it's MDAI, it's been lab tested by WEDINOS, twice [http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W003720](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W003720) [http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W003704](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W003704). It's light tan colour this time, but it seems similar in effect to the dark brown MDAI I got before. I didn't get the dark brown MDAI that I got before lab tested as it was just a 1gram one off score & there wasn't any more available, but I'm pretty sure the stuff I got was legit, especially now I've tried the tested new tan MDAI. The person that I bought the dark brown MDAI off got it tested at WEDINOS, result was MDAI with no other active chemicals & I've no reason to doubt it was genuine here is the result [http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W002556](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W002556).


The white 'MDAI Indian' from a certain vendor is fake, that tested as a mix of methiopropamine & phenethylamine. I know there's still at least one vendor still trying to sell that fake MDAI. This is a sample I sent in for testing [http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W002556](http://wedinos.tripsit.me/result/W002556)


Anyway, I plugged some of this new tan MDAI, it works. ~60mg wouldn't dissolve fully in 2ml of water, stuck it up my bum anyway with powder floating around in the syringe & it worked, but it was mild. Tried again with 80mg a few minutes later, it definitely works & it's definitely similar effects to that dark brown MDAI I had before (I only tried that oral). I've also had a bit of alcohol, some weed & some ethylphenidate. It seems a bit too sedative without any extra stimulant added. I'd had 60mg ethylphenidate, plugged, a few hours before, I needed to top up with another 30mg after the MDAI took full effect or it would have been bed time.


I quite like it, it's nothing earth shattering & no real substitute for MDMA, but for me it seems fairly pleasant, relatively clear headed & doesn't have much comedown. It's a definite improvement on just a standard boring dopamine/norepinephrine stimulant alone, eases some stimulant anxiety & it doesn't seem to have as bad comedown as MDMA. There's still some empathy, increased musical appreciation, mood lift, body high & anti-anxiety effect.

You didn't phrase that as a question? ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

...

No, theoretically, it shouldn't be.  MDAI is a highly selective 5ht releaser, so it's more serenic and less chatty than more broad-spectrum monoamine releasers.

Tried MDAI with MPA; really quite enjoyable; the comedown was easy; not sure whether to expect a crash in the coming days; reading some have terrible crash others much less than  MDMA; maybe down to how much people take? I know once a month is a good rule but can you do this more often since it doesn't quite hae the magic MD would?

You probably do need to stop. I have some too, I guess it's not really that pure. Later wedinos tests found another chemical as well as MDAI. I've been plugging some, but it doesn't dissolve well & it seems caustic at 15mg/ml, hate to think what that would do to your veins & I don't really want to plug it again.

Any idea what the other Chem was? Also dosage for oral? I usually never feel a thing orally, plugging is always uncomfortable too..


Also I haven't found it too caustic at all, nothing in comparison to 3fpm at least

Ok so my substance is light brown,mdai.i first took 13mg for allergy test.1 hour and 15 minutes later i dose 150mg,hour later not much effect.day 2 i dosed 150mg then added another 50mg half hour later sort of pleasant feeling but not much to notice very chatty.decide to leave it two days then i pop 250mg in a rebull on an empty stomach.30 mins later im so happy i found my level 250mg im buzzing like a warm glowing cushion is around me for at least an hour or could of been hour and a half.i was also taking 3 fpm,so when the mdai wears off i dont fall.ok i know doing mdai this much is stupid.maybe one day out of seven would be better redosing is pointless,and a waste.i cant say for sure how much 3fpm was in my system as been on it for two a weeks and a half before experiments.I also had two largers witch improved the situation.I think there must be a tolerance going on with this as i left it two days and i was baseline again.evrryday dosing is so pointless.

Phenylpiracetam, samples W003770, W003771, W003870.


oral doses for me were about 50mg threshold, 100-150mg common, over 150mg strong.

I just received some of this and took an allergy test (~5mg) this morning followed by a few small bumps bringing me to a total of ~35mg along side my usual 80mg of 3-FPM (I'm currently taking it daily as a self-treatment for ADHD) and coffee. It's a work day so I didn't want to push the dose too far at all but wanted a bit more than just an allergy test to maybe get an impression of what it might be like at higher doses. It's very subtle but can certainly notice a little something going on at this dose - my mood is slightly lifted and I'm getting the urge to stretch more often which feels quite pleasant. I'm looking forward to trying this out properly over the weekend.


EDIT: Just looked in the mirror. Hope no one notices my pupils lol. They aren't massive but they're certainly a bit bigger than normal.

roi posted this at another forum, apparently one of the samples that WEDINOS  tested as containing phenylpiracetam was retested by ecstasydata & didn't really contain any phenylpiracetam.


They also have a marquis, mecke & mandelin reagent test photo.

Hiya.


I've checked around and I can't find much consensus on using MDAI intravenously (IV) - Many people seem to take it orally, don't think much of it snorted, and the general consensus is that plugging/rectal is very good.  However, I've only seen one or two posts on IV.  I'm assuming that if it's quite active plugged then it should work well via IV?


Any thoughts?  I'm planning on railing 100mg tonight after taking 100-200mg orally over the last few days.  Thanks for any advice.

Plugging it isn't that worthwhile for MDAI. It's hard to dissolve much mdai in a small amount of water & it needs fairly high doses, usual doses are around 150mg, but only about 15mg/ml will dissolve in water. There's no rush or anything from plugging it, you can only do half a dose in a 5ml syringe, it can still take an hour to take full effect, it seems little stronger than oral doses & it can be uncomfortable. Railing it is not going to work well for the same reason, it'll just be painful & you'll get even less effect. I guess IV is pretty risky for very little or no benefit.

**Combination info Request**


Last night I experimented with one gram of MDMA.  After waking up after a couple of hours sleep this morning, a package arrived containing......MDAI.


Does anybody know if it is safe to conduct experiments involving MDMA one day and then, experimenting with 500g of MDAI the following day?


Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Welcome to Bluelight, Kristian.


You did 1000 mg of MDMA in one session? That's pretty bad on it's own. I kind of hope that your batch was extremely cut with inactive substances because taking that much MDMA in one session is a sure fire way to fuck yourself up, on multiple levels.


Regarding the MDAI, no, it wouldn't be safe. First of all, 500 mg is too much to begin with. Second of all, MDAI and MDMA works in a similar way when it comes to agonising the 5-HT receptors (both are Serotonin releasing agents), thus, you have to wait the same amount of time between using them as you would/should with MDMA. Which is **at least** one month, though 2-3 months are highly recommended. 


Due to their Serotonin releasing properties, they are also cross tolerant so I doubt that you would get much from taking MDAI today. Do yourself a favor and wait at least one month before taking either. Use that time to research these drugs as you clearly has a lot to learn about proper harm reduction - this site is full of good harm reduction advice so you definately came to the right place.

Took a total of around 350mg+ over the course of a night. After the final 100mg was taken, started experiencing bad postural hypotension. Could not stand up or my head would rush and I had to get down on my haunches or bend double to prevent fainting. Eventually did faint at one point at the end of the night. That last 100mg dose was taken as the effects were wearing off and did little to bring the good effects back. 


Aside from this worrying side effect from an apparent overdose, it was a nice experience. Not something I would consider much use in social situations due to the tendency to just close your eyes and mong out feeling nice but it would be a good experience snuggling up in bed with a loved one for a night of spooning and sex. Will have to ignore the desire to redose on the come down in future as that was a little scary.


Another thing. I felt quite cold during the experience and had my heating on pretty much all night. I only realised at the end of the night that the room was roasting. IDK if this had anything to do with the side effect I experienced but thought it worth mentioning.

Tried MDAI the first time yesterday. 120mg on empty stomach. My mind was very clear, but it was surprisingly visual, mainly OEVs. Music sounded great. Nice stuff. A little bit lacklustre, but with some weed MDAI is a winner for sure!

its much less neurotoxic than benzoflurans right?    that said when people combined it with a stimulate can it become neuortoxic?   from my research yes bc the mdai studies were done on mdai only and the dopmaine and ne/na , along with serotinin are what caused neutotoxity?   that said, without splitting hairs mdma is neurotoxic(some will debate/argue) and if a person is responsible and use quite infrequently, this most likely wouldn't be a issue , yes?

I've found it to be surprisingly trippy at times, though quite different to what one would expect from typical psychedelics like shrooms or LSD in terms of visuals (the head-space can be quite similar, though).


One time I took it fairly recently, I was sat by a fire and kept thinking I saw bubbles floating around out of the corner of my eye but it always turned out to be embers. I've heard of friends experiencing similar hallucinations from large doses of MDMA, though it was almost always a case of seeing people who weren't really there or misidentifying people who were there in those cases.

Hi, I was thinking about getting some MDAI but I am put off because it says you need to store it at -20 degrees C, and I don't think my tiny freezer gets anywhere near as cold as -20 degrees c.

Is a snazzy freezer that gets super cold totally necessary, or will it store ok in a freezer like mine, a shoebox size, one of those tiny freezers you get in those small waist high fridges.

Is it a waste of time me getting this stuff? I don't want to do it all straight away, I tend to like to stash stuff, speed seems to keep in my freezer without losing potency.

That is a really eloquent way of putting it.

I've never done mdai, but I remember liking the high of E pills about 13-14 years ago, and at the time, I liked the feeling that much, that I was starting to resent the times I was not on E.

I've had some sat in a draw at room temp for months with no problem -20 is probably ideal for very long term storage but the unstability of some of these compounds have been exaggerated - the vast majority will last a long time. Acid was sposed to be sensitive but last decades out of light. Main thing seem to be light moisture and accessive heat.

Ebola say theoretically no - I'd agree on papaer but with a little bit of stim in practise I'd say yes; maybe I suspect even without - theory doesn't always hold since simple release or reuptake isn't every thing - I am struggling with this area of neuroscience so won't try to explain but two equal 5HT releasers or whatever can have differing effects due to the more complex way te brain works. Maybe personal factors come in too. MDAI with a lot f stim can be get up and go; with a small amount of stim I think it can work socially better than 5MAPB which I didn't find good for this at all.

I've got some of this stuff, but i haven't tried it yet (just wanted to be sure to get some before it becomes banned). From what i've read about it, am i right that you could expect this stuff to be somewhere in between MDMA and MDA? And has anybody encountered MDMAI yet? if this stuff is close to MDMA, then MDMAI could maybe be even better than the real thing.

like any empathgeon if you want to keep the magic, ive found 3 months or longer breaks.  for me ive almost come to the conclusion 4 plus months between, but not totally ruled that out.  for sure at least every few months is best. the longer the better between research

no way nothing like these two. mdma and mda feel much stronger.  many different chemicals going on. mdai is simple just serotnin and is not even a minor or moderate stimulate like 5-mapb

Wouldn't pure SSRA drugs like MDAI be perfect for coke-like combos? Imagine some pure DA/NET inhibitor (not releasers, because of possible toxicity with MDAI and similar drugs?) like most phenidates or tropanes and norbornanes, combined with just enough of some SRA to give it that sunny happy coke feeling that normal stims are missing?


There seem to be two poles with pure serotonin or at least mostly serotonergic drugs like MDMA on one side, and the dopamine/noradrenaline stuff like amphetamine on the other pole. Only cocaine seems to have that special place in the middle where it's no "once a month" drug like MDMA because it doesn't deplete serotonin (as much) while also having strong effects on dopamine and noradrenaline, no other stim seems to have this kind of pharmacology.

That's what I thought.


Is it the one that lasts about 10 hours and is MDMA like, or is it the one that gets you really fucked like MDA but with a much shorter span of effects? I forget, but I've tried both. I think it's the latter. If so, I love it.

The first one you mention I would guess is 5-MAPB. 10 hours rolling is a stretch but 8 is definitely possible.


MDAI I've tried was the most mellow empathogen ever. Didn't even feel psychedelic, just being a love puddle for 4hours or so. Perfect cuddle drug. Eyes like saucers but almost didn't feel inebriated. I have never done MDA but I think that one makes you feel more spacy/psychedelic.

Mdai is not as neurotoxic as 5 mapb,  5- mapb is still pretty pure, but doses need to be respected, mg for mg, serotoin release is two times of mdma.  From your experience, it appears perfectly accurate.   Separate from serotonin, 5 mapb  does has a bit more dopamine and noradrenaline release from experience, even though some have said it doesnt release dopamine and ne, I found it did, and did cause stimulation.  Mdai, no experience, only from looking at the literature, it seems this is the purest empathogen serotonin releaser I'm aware of.   


 Either one is perfect for going extremely deep with someone you're comfortable going to that level with.   Further, if I were to choose, mdai over 5 mapb.   As one can see on this same page, it hasn't been available for close to a decade.

I had mdai once at 200mg, solid dose. Empathogenic but more calmer than mdma. You lie around talk all the time but seem to forget anything that just happened. But it had a nice body feel to it.


The other aminoindanes I know are either pure rubbish (eG 2-ai, n-methyl 2-ai or 4-methyl-aminoindane). The only one I found somewhat worthwhile was meai which is a bit lackluster on its own but really can produce beautiful results when combined with other amphetamines.


Mdai otoh was enough on its own, nothing too special but it was ok.

Could it be that the lack of stimulant properties further makes amnesia worse than with molly? Serotonergic drugs can cause amnesia indeed, but no one has ever explained why.

400 mg of MDAI and I think probably 60 to 100 of either five or six APB, talk about body feel.

If you look at the post I posted a few posts ago mdai does have dopamine and noradrenaline activity.    It's plenty on its own and mixing too many things may not be wise.  


I've done 5 mapbs solo and it felt like  massive serotonin release, far greater than 6 apb,  and 110 mgs 5 mapb felt on parr with about 225 mgs mdma.   Which makes sense 5 mapb is 1.5- 2 xs more serotonin release mg for mg than mdma.  


 I don't know mdais serotonin release compared to MDMa.   That said, I've done the borax combo 5 mapbs 2 fma and 5 mgs 4-ho-mipt , 100 mgs caffeine and some phenibut and it was on parr with mdma with a much leas comedown, three days afterwards.


I seem to be fine the second day after heavy MDMA use , then third day the post MDMA blues set in.  At least that's what it seemed like.  This is why I don't even dose much empathogens at all.  Been over a year.   


 Better safe than sorry and plenty of other compounds out there that don't seem to cause these negative post effects. I guess it's who your with as well, sometimes it's worth if and sometimes it's not.

I've had some for even Longer maybe. Had two batches. White and Brown. White Stayes White and Brown Stayes Brown. Both work equally well.

MDAI... I remember I had four one gram bags, white and brown from different vendors sometime around 2011. I only tried it once because I found it too calming to enjoy (like being in a quiet place, similar to red kratom) and there were so many seemingly much more exiting substances waiting to be sampled back then. Ordering stuff was easy, finding time to try it all - impossible.  Every 6 months or so I would have a fit of paranoia that the shear size of my stash would draw cups and throw away a dozen of bags. Those were the days...

Ime it totally lack's stimulant propertie's. Probably the most selective Serotonin releaser I took, although 100 mg 6-APB ranks pretty high to.


But on MDAI, about 100/ 150 mg probably. The only recollection's I have are moaning and lying. That's the problem with foreign language's i ment Laying, like in flat faceforward under a blanket.

So if you mention a correlation between amnesia and Serotonin it seems so, aswell as sedation. As on my 6-APB adventure you have some more stimules so i could listen to music. But overal even on MDMA memory get's blurry, goes for some other senses to like coordination, slurred speech. While music, dancing and bonding are enhanced under inflence's of Emphatogen's. But MDAI and a soft stimulant, something like Cathinone or Khat, would be nice.
