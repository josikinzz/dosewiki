**MDPV may cause [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and addiction at a significantly higher rate than other stimulants.**
 
Due to its unusually long duration, extreme potency, and compulsive nature, it is strongly discouraged to abuse this substance in high doses, multiple days in a row, or in combination with other drugs known to increase the risk of psychosis. MDPV is one of several designer drugs that has been sold as " [bath salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_salts_(drug)) " both in the US and in Europe; In a four-year period between September 2009 and August 2013, the European Union (EU) reported a concerningly high number of MDPV-related deaths, reaching 99.
 
Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDPV#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone** (also known as **MDPV** , and **Monkey Dust** ) is a novel lesser-known [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) classes. It is known to be one of the most powerful and potent stimulants. MDPV is thought to act primarily as a [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (NDRI).

MDPV was first developed in the 1960s by a team at Boehringer Ingelheim. It was claimed to have potential to be an alternative for racemic amphetamine and, despite showing some desirable qualities such as reduced toxicity as compared to amphetamine, was chosen to not be developed as a medicinal drug.

MDPV remained an obscure stimulant until around 2004, when it was reportedly first made available to the public as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) . Products labeled as "bath salts" containing MDPV were previously sold as recreational drugs in gas stations and convenience stores in the United States, similar to the marketing strategy of [Spice and K2](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synthetic_cannabinoids) as incense. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Subjective effects include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , and powerful [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) .

Several incidents of psychological and physical harm have been attributed to the use of MDPV, including an unusually large number of fatalities. A total of 107 non-fatal intoxications and 99 analytically confirmed deaths related to MDPV between September 2009 and August 2013 were reported by nine European countries.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

MDPV, or 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone, is a synthetic stimulant of the [cathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_cathinone) and [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_pyrrolidine) classes. MDPV is the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring-substituted analog of the compound [a-PVP](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/A-PVP) , developed in the 1960s, which has been used for the treatment of chronic fatigue and as an anorectic, but caused problems of abuse and dependence.

However, despite some shared structural features, the effects of MDPV bear little resemblance to other methylenedioxy phenylalkylamine derivatives such as 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ), instead producing primarily classical stimulant effects with only mild entactogenic qualities.

MDPV is structurally related to cathinone, an active alkaloid found in the khat plant, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and other schedule I phenethylamines. MDPV, like some other substances in this class, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant. MDPV is also reported to have hallucinogenic effects.

## Pharmacology

MDPV is thought to act primarily as a potent [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) . Reduced re-uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine results in higher concentrations of the two [catecholamine](/w/index.php?title=Catecholamine&action=edit&redlink=1) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) in the [synaptic cleft](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synapse) , or gap between [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) .

The result of this inhibition is an enhanced and prolonged concentration and resulting post-synaptic effect of dopaminergic and noradrenaline signaling at dopamine and norepinephrine receptors on the receiving neuron. [Serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) also plays a role, although to a much lesser degree. This sudden increase in neurotransmitter concentration in the brain is thought to be responsible for the high that MDPV produces.

Mainly possessing re-uptake inhibiting qualities and not releasing qualities, MDPV could be considered more like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) than [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) in method of action. In contrast, amphetamine acts primarily as an agonist to release dopamine and noradrenaline indirectly via activation of the TAAR1 receptor.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the offset of a stimulant experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its peak. This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of neurotransmitter depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**

- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
 It should be noted that many users consider the after effects of MDPV to be significantly more unpleasant if compulsively redosed. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The general cognitive effects of MDPV can be described as being similar to those of other typical stimulants. At common dosages, the MDPV high is described as being euphoric and slightly empatheogenic in its effects, causing increased motivation, sociability, sexual desire and concentration. Higher doses of MDPV, however, can intensify numerous negative effects such as anxiety and disorganized thoughts; at extremely high doses or continued use, delusions and psychosis become likely.

## Toxicity and harm potential

MDPV has a relatively short history of human use, with very few mentions concerning the use thereof before 2004. Although once considered a potential alternative to existing stimulants with a lower risk for toxicity, human MDPV administration has not been extensively studied in a clinical setting for many decades. Despite this, several recent studies on cases of persisting psychosis caused by chronic use of MDPV show promising rates of recovery among individuals who are treated with certain [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) and first-line [antihistamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) . There is currently no conclusive data concerning the neurotoxicity of MDPV in the human brain.

Anecdotal evidence from those who have tried MDPV in the community suggest that there are no negative health effects associated with the substance if simply taken at low doses by itself and when used sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

Data taken from in-vitro and in-vivo studies have indicated that MDPV shares similar properties to [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) ; in fact, MDPV is more potent than these two stimulants in a number of varying ways. The over-excitation of dopamine and noradrenaline caused by MDPV use, combined with MDPV's potential inability to create compensatory serotonergic activity, sets the stage for a number of hostile and psychotic reactions to the drug. These hostile tendencies have been witnessed in emergency response situations, and have also seen wide television coverage in the past, after an individual under the influence of MDPV viciously assaulted an innocent bystander. It is uncertain if the individual had any pre-existing mental disorders or if he was under the influence of any other drugs. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Lethal dosage

The exact lethal dosage of MDPV is unknown and no formal studies have been carried out in humans. For sake of reference, one report placed the lethal dosage for a 39 year old male at 0.4 micrograms per millilitre or greater following the results of a post mortem, but this data is far too individually unique and the variables simply too diverse to derive any kind of meaningful information from it. MDPV may be quantified in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide evidence in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma MDPV concentrations are expected to be in a range of 10–50 μg/L in persons using the drug recreationally, >50 μg/L in intoxicated patients, and >300 μg/L in victims of acute overdose.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Dependence and abuse potential

More so than other stimulants, the chronic use of MDPV can be considered highly addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and withdrawal effects may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage. Addiction is a serious risk among users of MDPV as it easily causes compulsive redosing and causes highly unpleasant comedown symptoms.

### Psychosis

User reports indicate that chronic abuse or single exposure overdose of MDPV can potentially lead to [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) more readily than the vast majority of stimulants. Psychotic symptoms from MDPV can include [hearing voices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations) , [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , urges to harm oneself, severe [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) , grandiosity, [paranoid delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , increased aggression, and [irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) .

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDPV can be potentially dangerous in combination with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) as it can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDPV should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDPV may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and other stimulants.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.
