## SYNTHESIS
To a solution of 0.33 g 6-cyano-nor-LSD in a mixture of 3 mL acetic acid and 0.6 mL H2O, under a nitrogen atmosphere, there was added 0.6 g powdered zinc and the stirred mixture was heated for 4 h with an external oil bath maintained at 130 Â°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to ice-bath temperature, diluted with an additional 3 mL H2O, and brought to an alkaline pH with the addition of concentrated NH4OH. This suspension was extracted with CH2Cl2 (5Ã10 mL), the pooled extracts dried with anhydrous Na2SO4, and the solvent removed (after filtration) under vacuum providing a tan solid. Centrifugal chromatography (with alumina and a 9:1 CHCl3/MeOH elution solvent under an ammonia vapor environment), followed by the removal of the solvent under vacuum, yielded a solid product which was recrystallized from EtOAc/hexanes. There was thus obtained 0.19 g (61%) of tan crystals of nor-LSD (9,10-didehydro-N,N-diethylergoline-8Î²-carboxamide) with a mp of 196â198 Â°C (dec).

To a solution of 66 mg nor-LSD in 2 mL freshly distilled DMF under a nitrogen atmosphere, there was added 48 mg anhydrous K2CO3 and 38 mg ethyl iodide. When TLC analysis indicated that the nor-LSD had been consumed (4 h) all volatiles were removed under a hard vacuum. The residue was solubilized in CHCl3 (5Ã5 mL) and the pooled extracts dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, cleared by filtration, and the solvent removed under vacuum. The residue was separated into two components by centrifugal chromatography (alumina, CH2Cl2, nitrogen and ammonia atmosphere) the first of which was the major product. After removal of the solvent, this was dissolved in hot benzene, filtered and cooled. The addition of hexane prompted crystallization of N-ethyl-nor-LSD (9,10-didehydro-N,N,6-triethylergoline-8Î²-carboxamide) as a white crystalline product which weighed 66 mg (61%) after drying. It had a mp of 108â110 Â°C and an [[Î±]D +40.5Â° (c 0.46, EtOH).


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 50 μgs, orally) âThis is already coming on in fifteen minutes, and is completely developed in another hour. Very few visual changes or distortions but easy eyes-closed imagery. Pretty much out after ten hours; it was a good, repeatable experiment.â

(with 60 μgs, orally) âIn about an hour or so, gentle movements of the house plants were noted. The walkway of the painting above the fireplace changed as if the sunny spots were moving ahead. The visual aspects became more LSD-like after a couple more hours, though in a very gentle way. The spider windowpane looked three-dimensional: at first I thought the windows were double-paned, but they were not. Stones, rocks and glass had a magical look to them, but tree bark looked like tree bark. Occasionally, a dark streak (spot) would go through the visual field and a page of a book would move sharply without effort. These aspects were very pleasant to me.â

(with 75 μgs, orally) âI am up to a ++ within the hour and am feeling lazy. It is very diuretic and certainly not anorexic. Have been dieting strenuously for the past 4 days, but could definitely be interested in food. Also a decongestant. Body feels balanced. Thinking easy. Concepts easy to follow through. Mind and feelings together as should be. Definitely a plus two, no further. I wonder if it would be possible, at any level, to attain that blurring of boundaries that is the plus three at its best? My mind was at all times capable of realistic and down-to-earth thought, this is not a material that will allow you to float two inches off of the floor.â

(with 100 μgs, orally) âIt sort of sneaks up on you. Certainly not the push of LSD and, sadly, not the sparkle either. Possible time slowing. Easy sleep and no price to pay the next day.â

(with 150 μgs, orally) âExtraordinary experience, none of the demands of LSD, just a completely together trip. There were hints of tummy discomfort and some chills early in the trial, but they were trivial and quickly passed. Fine music, and fine sex.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
I suspect that this material is rather unstable in solution, even as the tartrate in dilute saline, although I cannot guess why that should be. A few months in the dark, at zero degrees and in the absence of air, led to a very real drop in potency, measured by a control assay of a freshly made solution of the same nominal concentration.

What a difference a single atom makes, an ethyl rather than a methyl group at the ring-D nitrogen atom. The absence of any group there (a hydrogen atom rather than the methyl group of LSD or the ethyl group of ETH-LAD) is nor-LSD, the synthetic intermediate mentioned in the preparation recipe above. It has no activity at all even at a half a milligram. The allyl group at this location gives AL-LAD and the propyl group is PRO-LAD, and both of these are active and have their own individual entries.

**6-Ethyl-6- *nor* -lysergic acid diethylamide** (also known as **N-Ethyl- *nor* -lysergic acid N,N-diethylamide** , **N-Ethyl- *nor* -LSD** , and **ETH-LAD** ) is a lesser-known novel [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) class. ETH-LAD is chemically similar to LSD and has a similar mechanism of action, acting primarily by stimulating [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

The human use of ETH-LAD was first documented by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) in his 1997 book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). It is noted for its "modified visual distortion" relative to LSD. It has been marketed alongside psychedelic [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) like [1P-LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1P-LSD) and [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) as a legal, grey-market alternative to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and commercially distributed through online [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) vendors.

ETH-LAD has been shown to be moderately to significantly more potent than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) itself in animal studies with an active dose reported at between 40 and 100 micrograms. Anecdotal reports suggest that while it produces similar effects to LSD at low to common doses, it displays a notably divergent effects profile at higher doses, sometimes described as producing "algorithmic" and "warped" visual and [auditory distortions](/w/index.php?title=Auditory_distortions&action=edit&redlink=1) , combined with a more "introspective" and "analytical", if not more "neutral" head space.

ETH-LAD has also been reported to more readily produce adverse physical effects such as severe and persisting [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , [temperature dysregulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression) , and generalized [bodily discomfort](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures) , particularly at higher doses. This has been speculated to owe itself to an unusually sensitive and unpredictable dose-response curve, as low to common dose experiences are generally described as being very manageable and non-threatening.

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of ETH-LAD, and it has little history of human usage. Along with its sensitive dose-response and potentially concerning physical side effects, many reports suggest that this substance may be overly difficult to use safely for those who are not experienced with [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) . It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if using this substance.

## Chemistry

ETH-LAD, or 6-ethyl-6- *nor* -lysergic acid diethylamide, is a synthetic [alkaloid](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alkaloid) of the [lysergamide](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamide) chemical class. ETH-LAD is a structural analog of lysergic acid with an N,N-diethylamide functional group bound to R N of the chemical structure. This core polycyclic structure is an indole derivative and has both overlapping tryptamine and phenethylamine skeletons embedded within its molecular structure (although it is principally classified as a tryptamine). ETH-LAD's structure contains a bicyclic hexahydroindole fused to a bicyclic quinoline group ( *nor* -lysergic acid).

ETH-LAD does not contain a methyl group substituted at R6 of its *nor-* lysergic acid skeleton as is the case with LSD; this is represented by the *nor-* prefix. Instead, ETH-LAD is substituted at R6 with an [ethyl](/w/index.php?title=Ethyl&action=edit&redlink=1) group. At carbon 8 of the quinoline, a N,N-diethyl carboxamide is bound in the same configuration of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .

ETH-LAD is a chiral compound with two stereocenters at R5 and R8. ETH-LAD, also called (+)-D-ETH-LAD, has an absolute configuration of (5R, 8R). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

As with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and other compounds in the lysergamide family, ETH-LAD likely acts as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from ETH-LAD's efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors, although it is likely that like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , ETH-LAD also binds to a wide range of different receptors, including multiple different subtypes of serotonin receptors as well as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [adrenoreceptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Adrenaline) well. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the psychedelic experience remains subject to on-going scientific investigation.

## Subjective effects

While the subjective effects of ETH-LAD are reported to largely overlap with those of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , it has been noted for the tendency to be more visually and auditorily distortive, [introspective](/w/index.php?title=Introspective&action=edit&redlink=1) , [analytical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement) and [immersive](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement) yet with the capacity to produce pronounced [discomforting physical effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Discomforting_physical_effects) like severe and persisting [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) , and temperature dysregulation past the common dose range in a seemingly unpredictable manner.

Due to its high potency and sensitive dose-response, many reports also indicate that the effects of this substance may be overly intense for those who are not already very experienced with psychedelics. Users are advised to approach this substance with caution, use a full array of [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) , and pay close attention to their physical conditions and environment if using this substance.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, ETH-LAD is regarded as being able to produce a spectrum of either predominantly stimulating or sedating effects, often alternating throughout the experience, sometimes to the point of feeling forced. This is in distinction to other, more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin) which are more consistent in producing [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of ETH-LAD can be characterized as prominent in comparison to its accompanying visual and cognitive effects. Like LSD, it can behave as a fast-moving, sharp and location specific or generalized tingling sensation, although this feeling is not necessarily pleasant and often manifests in a neutral way. For some, it is manifested spontaneously at different, unpredictable points throughout the experience, but for most, it maintains a steady presence that rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached, which users tend to report as feeling "neutral", with the emphasis instead placed on alterations in the "head space". 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - This component can occur with the development of spontaneous bodily sensations, but is not as consistent as it is with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , and has more of a tendency to spontaneously produce mild to strong neutral if not uncomfortable physical sensations such as those that can be experienced on [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) .
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)** - This can manifest as either negative or pleasant bodily sensations capable of occurring anywhere, but particularly in the central areas of the body including the inner cavities like the chest or the lungs.
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it may be pronounced in ETH-LAD. It is highly advised that users of this compound, especially at heavier doses, monitor their bodily temperature and use techniques like hot showers or cold packs to regulate their core and brain temperature throughout the experience, and to generally always maintain proximity to a climate-controlled environment. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - In comparison to traditional psychedelics, ETH-LAD has been noted for being able to produce nausea and other " [body load](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_load) " type feelings more readily, potentially at any point during the experience but most prominently during the ["come up"](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Coming_up) .
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - This effect typically occurs either spontaneously, or on the comedown of higher doses than is thought the body can handle.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**

- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This effect is considerably less intense when compared with that of substances like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and happens more readily than with related substances like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , perhaps owing to the greater degree of stimulation it produces.
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an effect whose likelihood is largely extrapolated from the seizures that have been reported from the use of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . They are thought to mainly be a risk in those who are genetically predisposed to them, particularly while accompanied by physically taxing conditions such as states of dehydration, fatigue or undernourishment. Although the extent to which this differs from the seizure risk posed by [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) is totally unknown, it is highly advised that users should always be prepared for the worst case scenario. ### Visual effects
 
- ETH-LAD is reported to produce a remarkable and unique range of visual effects that are often described as "synthetic", "digital", and highly complex in feeling. It has been noted for its capacity to produce profoundly complex [visual hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic_visuals) , including higher level geometry, in a much more reliable and consistent manner than other members of the lysergamide family. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] 
#### Enhancements
 
The effects listed below are generally considered more pronounced than they are for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) at equipotent doses.
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
The effects listed below are generally considered to be more pronounced than they are for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) at equipotent doses.
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) )*

- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Environmental patterning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Environmental_patterning)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry encountered on ETH-LAD can be generally described as more similar in appearance to that of [DPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT) or [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) than [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSA) or [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, algorithmic in form, structured in organization, brightly lit, colourful in scheme, synthetic in feel, multicoloured in scheme, flat in shading, sharp in edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, angular in its corners, immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher dosages, it may almost consistently result in states of [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) or [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) visual geometry.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
ETH-LAD is capable of producing a full range of low and high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This effect is moderately more likely to occur than with LSD, particularly with strong to heavy doses. These machinescapes should not be confused for the ones commonly experienced on salvia however.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very consistent in dark environments at appropriately high dosages. They can be comprehensively described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) -based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme.
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of ETH-LAD can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocybin mushrooms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin_mushrooms) and [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) , ETH-LAD is often described as significantly more [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and fast-paced in terms of the specific style of thought stream(s) produced and contains a large number of potential effects. It should be noted that that higher doses appear to be readily capable of producing cognitive impairment and general sensory processing overload for reasons that are not currently understood. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect seems to be one of the uniquely pronounced features of this substance relative to other chemicals in its class. The kind of analysis enhancement experienced has drawn comparisons to the headspaces of drugs like [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DOM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOM) , with a more emotionally neutral charge than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [AL-LAD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AL-LAD) .
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** - While this effect can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this compound until the heavy dose range is reached.
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)**
- **[Introspection](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Introspection)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with this compound.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - These effects do not occur as commonly at low to moderate doses, particularly when the basic rules of [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) are taken into account, but can be overwhelming at higher doses. The negative sensations produced by this effect are seemingly more likely to manifest when the substance is combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . Therefore, this combination should be used with extreme caution if one is not experienced with psychedelics, meaning that the user should adequately pace themselves while taking only a fraction of their usual amount.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - This effect can be described as a perceived inability or general unwillingness to talk aloud despite feeling perfectly capable of formulating coherent thoughts within one's internal narrative. It appears to be less prominent at low doses and more prominent at high doses compared to related lysergamides like [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - This component and subcomponent may happen more readily and unpredictably than with other psychedelic compounds. For this reason, harm-reduction practices like having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) arranged beforehand when taking higher doses of this substance are highly advised. 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - This compound has been reported to produce more amnesic effects than LSD at higher doses.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - Some users have reported that the strong hallucinatory and memory suppressing effects of ETH-LAD at higher doses may lend itself more readily to states of confusion and disorientation than other psychedelics.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Déjà vu](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0_vu)**
- **[Thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide or psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially pronounced with ETH-LAD when it does occur.
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This component has been reported to be particularly pronounced relative to other psychedelics.
- **[Multiple thought streams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Multiple_thought_streams)** - This component can occur with the use of any lysergamide psychedelic, but reports suggest it can be especially likely to occur with this compound.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- Auditory effects are reported to be more pronounced with ETH-LAD than for [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . ETH-LAD has been noted for the sheer depth and range of auditory hallucinations and alterations it is capable of producing, for reasons that are yet poorly understood. 
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** - The audio hallucinations produced by ETH-LAD seem to be more prominent compared to many other psychedelics. The reasons are not yet understood, but those who use this substance are advised to be prepared for the uncontrollable auditory hallucinations it can produce.
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** - This effect is uniquely pronounced relative to other members of the lysergamide family. At doses above the common dose, they are liable to either be neutral if not mildly disturbing or intriguing. ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - Many reports suggest that this substance is especially reliable at inducing synaesthetic states in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Spirituality enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spirituality_enhancement)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ETH-LAD use in humans does not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because ETH-LAD is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal reports from those who have tried ETH-LAD suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying it by itself at low to moderate doses or using it very sparingly (although nothing can be guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

ETH-LAD is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. As with most psychedelics, it is generally considered to have a built-in, self-regulating aspect to it, although cases of its abuse have been reported. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Tolerance to the effects of ETH-LAD builds almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 5-7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 14 days to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ETH-LAD presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of ETH-LAD all psychedelics will display a reduced effect.

### Overdose

While ETH-LAD has no known toxic dosage, many anecdotal reports suggest this compound to be harsher to handle in overdoses when compared to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or other [lysergamides](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Lysergamides) . Overdose effects can already start in the heavy dose range and are described as being particularly uncomfortable and bizarre. Some of these effects include [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , severe [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and body load, and more rarely [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . Medical attention is usually only needed if suspected of severe psychotic episodes or [“fake acid”](/w/index.php?title=Fake_acid&action=edit&redlink=1) (such as [25i-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe) or [DOB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOB) ). Administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) or [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotics) can help to relieve the negative cognitive effects.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of ETH-LAD. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Legal status

ETH-LAD is currently a gray area compound within many parts of the world. This means that it is not known to be specifically illegal within most countries. People may still be charged for its possession under certain circumstances such as under analogue laws (as an analogue of LSD) and with the intent to sell or consume.

- **Austria** : ETH-LAD is technically not illegal but it may fall in the NPSG (Neue-Psychoaktive-Substanzen-Gesetz Österreich) as an analogue of LSD. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Germany** : ETH-LAD is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Latvia** : ETH-LAD is illegal in Latvia. Although ETH-LAD is not officially scheduled, it is controlled as an LSD structural analog due to an amendment made on June 1, 2015.
- **Poland** : ETH-LAD is a NPS class drug in Poland, making it illegal to possess or distribute.
- **Switzerland** : ETH-LAD is a controlled substance specifically named under Verzeichnis E. . It is scheduled as of the of December 1, 2015.
- **Turkey:** ETH-LAD is a classed as drug and is illegal to possess, produce, supply, or import.
- **United Kingdom** : As of January 7, 2015, ETH-LAD is specifically named in the U.K. Misuse of Drugs Act as a Class A controlled substance.
- **United States** : ETH-LAD is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analogue of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) (which is a Schedule I compound under the Controlled Substances Act). As such, the sale for human consumption or the use for illicit non-medical or scientific research could be prosecuted as crimes under the Federal Analogue Act.

ETH-LAD, or ETHLAD, also known as 6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; also known as METH-LAD). It is slightly more potent than LSD and is among the most potent psychedelics known. The drug is taken orally.
It acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. In addition, it binds to dopamine receptors. The drug produces psychedelic-like effects in animals. It is closely structurally related to LSD and to other psychedelic lysergamides like PRO-LAD and AL-LAD.
ETH-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by 1976. Its effects in humans were assessed and reported by Alexander Shulgin in the 1980s and 1990s. The drug was encountered as a novel recreational designer drug in Europe by 2016. In addition, a prodrug of ETH-LAD, 1P-ETH-LAD, has been developed and encountered as a designer drug.

## Use and effects

According to Alexander Shulgin in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved), ETH-LAD has a dose of 40 to 150 μg orally and a duration of 8 to 12 hours. However, it also produced clear effects at a dose of 20 μg, and in other publications, Shulgin gave a lower dose range for the drug of 40 to 80 μg. Its onset ranges from 15 minutes to 1 hour and peak effects occur after about 1 to 2 hours.
Shulgin has stated that ETH-LAD is "a little more potent" than LSD or roughly twice as potent as LSD in humans. Other researchers have described it as "slightly more potent" or "somewhat more potent" than LSD in humans. For comparison, Shulgin lists the dose range of LSD as 60 to 200 μg or 50 to 200 μg in his publications. Based on the preceding findings, ETH-LAD is one of the most potent serotonergic psychedelics known in humans, if not the most potent known psychedelic. As a result of this, it has been said that LSD can no longer be considered the most potent psychedelic.
The effects of ETH-LAD have been reported to include closed-eye imagery, very few visual changes or distortions, gentle movements of objects, LSD-like visual aspects, two-dimensional surfaces looking three-dimensional, objects looking "magical", and possible time slowing. It was described as making the body feel balanced, thinking being easy, concepts easy to follow through, mind capable of realistic and down-to-earth thought, and warmth and humor being present. Other reported effects included feeling lazy, diuretic effects, no appetite loss, decongestant effects, stomach discomfort, and chills.
Compared to LSD, ETH-LAD was described as lacking the push and sparkle of LSD, allowing for extraordinary experiences with none of LSD's demands, being less aggressive than LSD and lacking its "taking control" nature, having a greatly modified degree of visual distortion relative to LSD, having visual effects similar to LSD but much more gentle, and being more allowing than demanding.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

ETH-LAD acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It shows greater potency and efficacy as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonist than LSD in vitro. In addition to the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the drug binds with high affinity to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors. Like LSD, ETH-LAD also binds with lower affinity to the dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptors.
ETH-LAD shows psychedelic-like effects in animals, specifically rodent drug discrimination tests. It is about 1.6- to 2.3-fold more potent than LSD in these tests. Similarly to LSD, ETH-LAD shows moderate anti-inflammatory effects in preclinical research, but with slightly higher potency.

### Pharmacokinetics

The in-vitro metabolism of ETH-LAD has been studied.

## Chemistry

ETH-LAD, also known as 9,10-didehydro-N,N,6-triethylergoline-8β-carboxamide or as 6-ethyl-6-nor-LSD, is a substituted lysergamide derivative related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; also known as METH-LAD). It is the 6-ethyl derivative of nor-LSD (6-nor-LSD; H-LAD) and is the derivative of LSD with an ethyl group instead of methyl group at the 6 position of the ergoline ring system.

### Properties

According to Alexander Shulgin, ETH-LAD may be chemically unstable in solution.

### Synthesis

The chemical synthesis of ETH-LAD has been described.

### Analogues

Analogues of ETH-LAD include nor-LSD, LSD, PRO-LAD, IP-LAD, AL-LAD, FLUORETH-LAD, and CE-LAD, among others. 1P-ETH-LAD, a prodrug of ETH-LAD, has been developed and encountered as a novel designer drug.

## History

ETH-LAD was first described in the scientific literature by Tetsukichi Niwaguchi and colleagues by 1976. Subsequently, its preclinical pharmacology was studied and described by Andrew J. Hoffman and David E. Nichols in 1985. ETH-LAD's properties and effects in humans were assessed by Alexander Shulgin. These observations were reported via personal communication by Nichols in 1986, later described by Shulgin himself in a 1994 literature review, and described in-depth by Shulgin himself in his 1997 book TiHKAL (Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved). ETH-LAD was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe by 2016.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Switzerland

ETH-LAD is illegal in Switzerland as of December 2015.

#### United Kingdom

On June 10, 2014, the United Kingdom Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) recommended that ETH-LAD be specifically named in the UK Misuse of Drugs Act as a class A drug despite not identifying it as ever having been sold or any harm associated with its use. The UK Home office accepted this advice and announced a ban of the substance to be enacted on 6 January 2015.
