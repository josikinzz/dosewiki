## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as primary alcohols. These are compounds comprising the primary alcohol functional group, with the general structure RCOH (R=alkyl, aryl).

### Background

A clear, colorless liquid rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and distributed throughout the body. It has bactericidal activity and is used often as a topical disinfectant. It is widely used as a solvent and preservative in pharmaceutical preparations as well as serving as the primary ingredient in alcoholic beverages.

### Indication

For therapeutic neurolysis of nerves or ganglia for the relief of intractable chronic pain in such conditions as inoperable cancer and trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux), in patients for whom neurosurgical procedures are contraindicated.

### Pharmacodynamics

Alcohol produces injury to cells by dehydration and precipitation of the cytoplasm or protoplasm. This accounts for its bacteriocidal and antifungal action. When alcohol is injected in close proximity to nerve tissues, it produces neuritis and nerve degeneration (neurolysis). Ninety to 98% of ethanol that enters the body is completely oxidized. Ethanol is also used as a cosolvent to dissolve many insoluble drugs and to serve as a mild sedative in some medicinal formulations. Ethanol also binds to GABA, glycine, NMDA receptors and modulates their effects. Ethanol is also metabolised by the hepatic enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase.

### Mechanism of Action

Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subunit alpha-1
Agonist
Glutamate receptor ionotropic, NMDA 3A

### Mechanism of action

Ethanol affects the brain’s neurons in several ways. It alters their membranes as well as their ion channels, enzymes, and receptors. Alcohol also binds directly to the receptors for acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA, and the NMDA receptors for glutamate. 
The sedative effects of ethanol are mediated through binding to GABA receptors and glycine receptors (alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits). It also inhibits NMDA receptor functioning. In its role as an anti-infective, ethanol acts as an osmolyte or dehydrating agent that disrupts the osmotic balance across cell membranes.

### General Function

Catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of a wide variety of carbonyl-containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols (PubMed:10510318, PubMed:30538128). Displays enzymatic activity towards endogenous metabolites such as aromatic and aliphatic aldehydes, ketones, monosaccharides and bile acids, with a preference for negatively charged substrates, such as glucuronate and succinic semialdehyde (PubMed:10510318, PubMed:30538128). Functions as a detoxifiying enzyme by reducing a range of toxic aldehydes (By similarity). Reduces methylglyoxal and 3-deoxyglucosone, which are present at elevated levels under hyperglycemic conditions and are cytotoxic (By similarity). Involved also in the detoxification of lipid-derived aldehydes like acrolein (By similarity). Plays a role in the activation of procarcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon trans-dihydrodiols, and in the metabolism of various xenobiotics and drugs, including the anthracyclines doxorubicin (DOX) and daunorubicin (DAUN) (PubMed:11306097, PubMed:18276838). Also acts as an inhibitor of protein S-nitrosylation by mediating degradation of S-nitroso-coenzyme A (S-nitroso-CoA), a cofactor required to S-nitrosylate proteins (PubMed:30538128). S-nitroso-CoA reductase activity is involved in reprogramming intermediary metabolism in renal proximal tubules, notably by inhibiting protein S-nitrosylation of isoform 2 of PKM (PKM2) (By similarity). Also acts as a S-nitroso-glutathione reductase by catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of S-nitrosoglutathione (PubMed:31649033). Displays no reductase activity towards retinoids (By similarity)
