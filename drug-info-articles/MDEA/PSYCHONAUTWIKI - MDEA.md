**3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine** (also known as **MDEA** , **MDE** , and colloquially as **Eve** ) is a lesser-known [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. MDEA is chemically similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) . It produces its effects by increasing levels of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) in the brain.

The first recorded human use of MDEA was in 1976 by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who noted its similarity to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) in both effects and potency, though faster to act and shorter in duration. The synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of MDEA and a series of related compounds were published in 1980. MDEA is included in Shulgin's 1991 book " [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) " (" [Phenethylamines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) I Have Known and Loved").

In the United States, MDEA was introduced recreationally in 1985 as a legal substitute to the newly banned MDMA before it was made a Schedule I substance two years later. Since then, MDEA has rarely been sold on its own and has largely been used as an occasional additive or substitute ingredient in pills of "Ecstasy".

Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MDEA,. As a result it is highly advised to approach this potentially habit-forming [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) substance with the proper amount of precaution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use#Hallucinogens) if choosing to use it.

## History and culture

In the United States, MDEA was introduced recreationally in 1985 as a legal substitute to the newly banned MDMA before it was made a Schedule I substance two years later on August 13, 1987 under the Federal Analogue Act. Since then, MDEA has rarely been sold on its own and has largely been used as an occasional additive or substitute ingredient in pills of "Ecstasy" (for instance, studies conducted in the 1990s found MDEA present in approximately four percent of ecstasy tablets).

While MDEA shares many of the core entactogenic properties of MDMA, it is slightly less potent and considered to be more "stoning", lacking the pro-socializing and energizing "magic" most party-goers seek in their MDMA experiences. As a result, it is largely considered by most people to be a less desirable variant of MDMA and is thus rarely produced and sold in the illicit drug market, typically showing up only in small batches synthesized and distributed by hobbyist clandestine chemists.

## Chemistry

MDEA, also known as 3,4-Methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) chemical class. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Additionally, MDEA contains an ethyl substitution on R N , which is a single carbon extension of the methyl group present in MDMA. MDEA also contains substitutions at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups that are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene bridge. MDEA shares this methylenedioxy ring with other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) like [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [MDA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDA) and [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) .

## Pharmacology

MDEA acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) and [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of the [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [noradrenaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noradrenaline) . These neurotransmitters are responsible for modulating focus, motivation, pleasure, and reward.

The "stoning" effects of MDEA are thought to arise from the higher relative activity MDEA has on releasing serotonin over dopamine compared to MDMA.

MDEA stimulates the release of oxytocin and prolactin, two hormones that are currently being studied for their potential roles in modulating the feeling of trust and love.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, MDEA is commonly regarded as significantly less stimulating and energizing than MDMA, while still retaining its core entactogenic effects. Unlike MDMA, which encourages activities such as running, climbing and dancing in a way that makes it a popular choice for musical events such as festivals and raves. The distinct style of stimulation which MDEA presents can be described as mildly to moderately forced, trending more towards sedation and relaxation. This means that at higher doses, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily body shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in an extreme unsteadiness of the hands and a general lack of motor control, though to a far lesser degree than with MDMA.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDEA can be characterized as a moderate to extreme euphoric relaxing sensation that encompasses the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses to the point of "flooring" or immobilizing the user. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached, before steadily dropping off. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)**
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - This effect, combined with sedation, is possibly the basis for why MDEA is frequently characterized as "stoning" relative to other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) , which often have more pronounced [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) effects.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - As MDEA is a serotonin releasing agent, rise in core body temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose results in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) which can be fatal if left untreated. 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - As MDEA is a serotonin releasing agent, rise in core body temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose results in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) which can be fatal if left untreated.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Like related entactogenic stimulants, feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with MDEA; this effect is a product of an [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and metabolism. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment) there have been a number of users who have suffered from [water intoxication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking, so it is advised that users simply sip at the water and never over-drink.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of MDEA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is caused by MDEA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This component is usually only present in the higher dose range, and to a lesser extent than the teeth grinding associated with MDMA.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
MDEA presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctively present. These generally include:
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
MDEA is capable of producing a unique range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects are far more common during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of the experience and commonly include:
 
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of MDEA can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The broad head space of MDEA is described by many as one of moderate mental stimulation, feelings of love, warmth or empathy and powerful relaxing euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) and [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is present, but not nearly as consistent, pronounced, powerful and therapeutic than one would experience with MDMA With time and repeated use, however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instills becomes fully grounded and already in place, making people feel merely stimulated and euphoric with no new found urges to communicate, with others. Some users report that MDEA "loses its magic" with as few as 10 experiences, while others have reported hundreds of uses before the empathic qualities disappear. This does not appear to be valid for all users, however, with many users reporting that they have not experienced any decrease in quality of the experience despite dozens or even hundreds of uses.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong emotional euphoria and feelings of happiness are present within MDEA and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release.
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression are common within MDEA and speed up the experience of time quite noticeably.
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate doses of anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of unity, oneness and interconnectedness between level 1 - 2 are common within MDEA. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** & **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** - Some users note extremely strange, vivid and sometimes rather scary dreams for several nights after taking large doses of MDEA.
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users note sleep paralysis after consuming MDEA, particularly in high doses or in conjunction with other factors such as lack of sleep or physical fatigue.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDEA](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDE.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Short-term physical health risks of MDEA consumption include [dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) , [hyperthermia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hyperthermia) , and hyponatremia. Continuous activity without sufficient rest or rehydration may cause body temperature to rise to dangerous levels, and loss of fluid via excessive perspiration puts the body at further risk as the stimulatory and euphoric qualities of the drug may render the user oblivious to their energy expenditure for quite some time. Diuretics such as alcohol may exacerbate these risks further.

The exact toxic dosage is unknown, but considered to be far greater than its active dose.

### Neurotoxicity

As with MDMA, the neurotoxicity of MDEA use has long been the subject of debate. Scientific study has resulted in the general agreement that, although it is physically safe to try in a responsible context, the administration of repeated or high dosages of MDEA is likely to be neurotoxic and cardiotoxic in some form.

Like other powerful serotonin releasing agents, MDEA is thought to cause down-regulation of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) reuptake transporters in the brain. The rate at which the brain recovers from serotonergic changes is unclear. One study demonstrated lasting serotonergic changes in some animals exposed to MDMA, which likely applies to MDEA as well. Other studies have suggested that the brain may recover from serotonergic damage.

### Cardiotoxicity

Like with MDMA, the long-term heavy use of MDEA is likely similarly cardiotoxic, leading to valvulopathy through its actions on the 5-HT 2B receptor. In one study, 28% of long-term MDMA users (2-3 doses per week for a mean of 6 years, mean of age 24.3 years) had developed clinically evident valvular heart disease.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of MDEA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of MDEA develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly larger doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 1-1.5 months for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2-3 months to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). MDEA presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and entactogens, meaning that after the consumption of MDEA all of these will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDEA should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDEA may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **Stimulants** - The neurotoxic effects of MDEA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **Cocaine** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when MDEA is taken with many antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Additionally, if MDEA is taken with SSRIs and SNRIs, the MDEA will be significantly less powerful or may have no distinguishable effects at all.
