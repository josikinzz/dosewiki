## Subjective Experience

This is the only drug in this book which I didn’t self-administer, largely because of
the photograph on the following page and the unreliability of supply.

Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid which is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine.
First synthesized in 1959, it was approved for medical use in the United States in

1968. Its effects resemble those of other drugs in this class, and are often considered
to be particularly close to those of heroin.

It has become synonymous with a huge wave of overdose fatalities, which began to
accelerate dramatically from circa 2013.

According to Wikipedia (2023): “fentanyl and its analogues have been responsible
for most drug overdose deaths in the United States, causing over 71,238 deaths in
2021 “.

Pharmaceutically a wide range of forms are available, including skin patches, pills
and nasal sprays (liquid), although on the street, powder is most commonly used. It
should be noted that fentanyl is often used as an adulterant in heroin and other
substances, which creates increased risk within the drug eco-system as a whole.

This isn’t one to use in combination with other psychoactives, and frankly, given the
current situation, it isn’t one to use at all. Indeed, at the time of writing this edition it
is voluntarily banned from the major darknet markets.

Should you proceed with this chemical despite the warnings here, it is suggested that
you have naloxone (NARCAN) readily and visibly available, that you use gloves for
handling and that you conscientiously adopt all the harm reduction measures,
including those specifically listed under the heroin entry.

FATAL DOSE COMPARISON
If this picture doesn't paint a thousand words you are not paying attention. In part it
explains the wave of opioid related deaths which is currently sweeping the United
States. It also surely emphasises why the safety information in this book should be
common knowledge, rather than tucked away in the shadows.

Note that the photograph itself comes courtesy of the DEA (Drug Enforcement
Agency). On contacting them regarding its use, I asked if they would place it into the
public domain rather than simply grant permission to reproduce, as this would be
more likely to have a positive impact upon public health. Their response was
affirmative. Credit where it's due...
