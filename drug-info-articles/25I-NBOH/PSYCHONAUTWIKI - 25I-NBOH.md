**25I-NBOH may result in severe injury or death.**
 
While no deaths have been reported, it is likely that this compound shares a similar toxicity profile with [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) (which has been linked to multiple deaths). It is strongly discouraged to take higher doses of this substance or to [insufflate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Insufflation) (snort) it. Please see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOH#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**25I-NBOH** (also known as **2C-I-NBOH** , **NBOH-2C-I** , and **Cimbi-27** ) is novel synthetic [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenethylamine) class. It is a closely related analog of [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) and is reported to share most of its properties with the exception of a moderately reduced potency and a shorter duration.

The name 25I-NBOH, which short-hand for 2C-I-NBOH, is a derivative of the phenethylamine psychedelic [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . It was first synthesized and documented in 2006 by a team at Purdue University led by [David Nichols](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/David_E._Nichols) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It has been studied in its 11C radiolabelled form as a potential ligand for mapping the distribution of 5-HT 2A receptors in the brain, using positron emission tomography (PET).

It is worth noting that compounds of the NBOH family are not [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) active and should be administered [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) by placing and holding it into one's mouth and allowing it to absorb over a period of 15-25 minutes.

Extremely little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of 25I-NBOH in humans. It has no history of human use before being sold online as a [designer drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Designer_drug) in 2011. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] It is closely related to members of the [25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) series, specifically [25I-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe) , which has been associated with [many deaths and hospitalizations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25i-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) . Anecdotal reports suggest that this substance may be difficult to use safely due to its highly sensitive dose-response and unpredictable effects.

## Chemistry

25I-NBOH or 2C-I-NBOH, is a serotonergic N-benzyl derivative of the substituted phenethylamine psychedelic known as [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) . 25I-NBOH is a substituted phenethylamine with methoxy groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 5 as well as an iodine atom attached to carbon R 4 . It differs from [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) structurally through a substitution on the amine (NH2) with a 2-hydroxybenzyl (BOH) group. 25I-NBOH shares this 2-hydroxybenzyl substitution with other chemicals of the NBOH family. This NBOH addition is comprised of a hydroxy ether OH- bound to a benzene ring at R 2 .

## Pharmacology

25I-NBOH has efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) where it acts as a potent [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) .

This compound is pharmacologically unique when compared to other psychedelics due to the unusually high selectivity it displays for [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) receptors. It is notable as one of the most selective agonist ligands for the 5-HT2A receptor with an EC 50 value of 0.074 nM and more than 400x selectivity over the 5-HT2C receptor. It has a Ki of 0.061 nM at the human 5HT 2A receptor, similar to the better-known compound 25I-NBOMe, making it some twelve times as potent of 2C-I itself.

However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, 25I-NBOH is usually considered to be very energetic and stimulating. For most people, this substance induces a unique type of physical stimulation which can be described as feeling extremely energetic but in a way which does not force the tripper to move unless they genuinely choose to do so. For others, however, the stimulation can be quite uncontrollable, occasionally resulting in bodily shakes and a grinding of the teeth comparable to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and traditional stimulants such as [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) .
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - In terms of the body’s perceived weight, this substance consistently leaves people feeling extremely light, often to the point of total weightlessness.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" itself can be described as a mild, all-encompassing, soft but euphoric tingling sensation. This tingling sensation is also accompanied by spontaneous rushes of [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria) that become longer and more drawn out proportional to the dosage consumed.
- **[Mouth numbing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mouth_numbing)** - Assuming the substance has been taken [sublingually](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sublingual) , the very first physical effect which a person will notice immediately after sublingual absorption is a strong, unpleasant metallic chemical taste. This is accompanied by a very distinct feeling of general numbness of the tongue and mouth which can stay for up to an hour after the blotter paper has been consumed.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - As the user begins to come up, nausea is not uncommon and can sometimes result in initial vomiting, although nausea usually disappears when the user has vomited or the trip fully set in. In comparison to other psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) , this could actually be considered very mild in its intensity.

- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Magnification](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Magnification)** - At higher doses, users can experience a "fish-eye" effect, where magnification changes based on the direction the user is looking relative to the object.
 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Frame rate suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frame_rate_suppression)**
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Melting) , [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Flowing) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#Breathing) and [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting#_morphing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion, static in appearance and unrealistic/cartoon-like in style.
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**

#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by this substance is similar to [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) and can be comprehensively described as algorithmic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, fine and zoomed out in detail, fast and smooth in motion, structured in shape, colorful in scheme, glossy in color, sharp around the edges and equally angular as well as rounded across their corners. In comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics they can be described as significantly more intricate than the visual geometry found within [2C-I](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-I) and most of the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) family in general as well as completely on par with [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) at appropriately high dosages.
 
25I-NBOH’s geometry leads reliably leads to [Level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry with [Level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Level_8B) remaining so far unconfirmed. It seems to consistently be able to build up in visual intensity when the user stares at a central point. This eventually envelops the visual field and creates the sensation that the tripper has broken through into a continuously shifting geometric landscape or structure with a vast sense of immersive physical size attributed to it.
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
25I-NBOH is capable of producing a full range of hallucinatory states within the level 1 - 3 range extremely consistently. However, level 4 hallucinatory breakthroughs are reported but very different and inconsistent in comparison to other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [2C-E](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-E) and [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) .
 
These effects include:
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Machinescapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Machinescapes)** - This component is an uncommon effect that typically only occurs at very strong to heavy doses. It also tends to be accompanied by overwhelming if not dangerous physical and cognitive effects.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - ( *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ). These are more common within dark environments and can be described as lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of 25I-NBOH are described by many as notably light in comparison to the classical [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . It is not uncommon for people to report feeling that their thought stream has maintained general normality in its specific style throughout low to moderate dosages. At high dosages, however, strong to overwhelming cognitive alterations become present, which can lead to states of [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) , and general sensory overload. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)** - This effect is generally only present at low doses.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)** and **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)** - Although one of 25I-NBOH's effects is thought acceleration, the opposite may occur at higher doses.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)** - This effect is considered to be very mild compared to traditional psychedlics.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - This effect seems to occur more readily than other psychedelics, perhaps due to its very prominent stimulating properties 
- **[Feelings of impending doom](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Feelings_of_impending_doom)** - This is generally only experienced during the comedown period or if one has taken a large amount of the substance.
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - The [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) effects range from mild to powerful, but are inconsistently manifested. Entactogenic effects for people who try this substance usually become prominent in the presence of others. These feelings of increased sociability, love and empathy do not seem to be quite as strong or profound as those found within other [entactogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) (such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) and [AMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/AMT) )
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**

- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)**
- **[Auditory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucination)** ### Multi-sensory effects
 
- - **[Dosage independent intensity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dosage_independent_intensity)** - While the reasons for this are not understood, many reports suggest that this substance can produce unexpectedly strong or weak effects even when taken at the seemingly same dose in an unpredictable manner. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This may contribute to the relative risk it is poses compared to most other psychedelics.
- **[Synaesthesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Synaesthesia)** - In its fullest manifestation, this is a very rare and non-reproducible effect. Increasing the dosage can increase the likelihood of this occurring, but seems to only be a prominent part of the experience among those who are already predisposed to synaesthetic states. ### Transpersonal effects
 
- While they are occasionally reported, the transpersonal effects produced by this substance seem to be significantly less consistent and reproducible than other [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , which perhaps corresponds with the notably mild changes to one's perceptual and cognitive processes. 
- **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)**
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

25I-NBOH is a relatively new substance, and little is known about its toxicity or interaction with other substances. It is assumed to pose similar acute health risks as 25I-NBOMe (see [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25I-NBOMe#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more information). The [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) has not yet been determined although it is likely to be potentially fatal at heavy dosages.

25I-NBOH's extreme potency means it should not be [insufflated](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insufflated) (snorted) as this method of administration has been associated with many deaths and hospitalizations with the closely related 25I-NBOMe.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

25I-NBOH is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 25I-NBOH is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 1 week for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 25I-NBOH presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 25I-NBOH all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Lithium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is commonly prescribed for the treatment of [bipolar disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder) . There is a large body of anecdotal evidence that suggests taking it with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) significantly increases the risk of [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) . As a result, this combination is strictly discouraged.
- **[Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)** - Cannabis may have an unexpectedly strong and unpredictable synergy with the effects of 25I-NBOH. Caution is advised with this combination as it can significantly increase the risk of adverse psychological reactions like [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . Users are advised to start off with only a fraction of their normal cannabis dose and take long breaks between hits to avoid unintentional overdose.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants like [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) or [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) affect many parts of the brain and alter [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) function. This combination can increase the risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . This interaction may also result in an elevated risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is well-documented to lower the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act to trigger seizures in susceptible individuals. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
