just looking for more info on it... not too much info on erowid.  but all in all it sounds really good.  no reported bad trips.  no reported toxic effects.  just a 8-10 hour avg. audio trip.  dont really effect any other sense other than hearing.  you get a mild tryptamine buzz.  its uncontrolled and unschedualed by the US government.  has anyone tried it?  what do you think of it?  what is a good average dose?

honestly, it sounded interesting, and i was really looking forward to it, but i was kinda dissappointed by it..25 mg gave me a nice buzz ala low dose shroomz with no audio effects..another 25 on top of that made my voice and other voices all pitched down , muffled, and underwater..kinda creepy..i was really looking forward to it, but it was a rather boring effect, and got real old real quick..it was kinda emmbarassing to talk..i wouldn't wanna take it at a party or anything...and there was ALOT more body buzz than most trip reports mention..at least for us..maybe a dosage higher than 50 mg would bring out wierder audio tricks, but things would hafta get a WHOLE lot wierder to impress me i think..

It sounds as if DIPT, like DPT, is best consumed as a smoked freebase.  I am definately going to try DIPT smoked as I had great trips after smoking DPT.

**DiPT Insufflation**


Does anyone have any experience with insufflated doses for DiPT (yes, I mean DiPT, not 5-MeO-DiPT or DPT)?

Three or four times I insufflated 20 to 25 mg. One time I insufflated 33 mg , another time I insufflated 44 mg after a night out drinking and one other time I orally ingested 50 mg. When the compound was ingested orally the audio hallucinations lasted for about twenty-four hours, really got old after a while. Plus the GI discomfort was pretty bad. 

Everything is tuned down a whole octave while on this stuff. Your own voice sounds alien to you, as well as everyone else's. 

Duration with insufflated doses was usually around 3-4 hours with the audio effects  lasting a little longer, 30 mins. to an hour (otherwise back to baseline in 3-4).  With oral ingestion duration was maybe 6 hours, with the audio effects lasting well into the next day  

Some visual distortions (especially when 33 mg and 44 mg was insufflated). Mainly objects wavering, slight color enhancement, but it's mostly all audio as far as the hallucinations go. 

I think for the most part a clear head was kept throughout the trips (i.e. no mindfuck). I was able to think clearly and carry on normal conversations, even at the highest dose. 

For me the best part was was the tactile sensations. Every touch just felt amazing. Laying on the couch by the fire was just extacy, and sex was incredible. When the higher doses were tested (33 mg and 44 mg) the sensations bordered on uncomfortable. Some grinding of the teeth and muscle tightness 

For me the best dose was around the 25 mg. level (insufflated). With the oral ingestion the audio effects just lasted too long and the GI discomfort was a pain. 

I was very interested in this compound for a long time. The audio hallucinations really sparked my curiosity. I was glad I got the chance to experiment with it a few times.

Did you still experience any GI discomfort or nausea with the insufflated doses?

It has been my experience that snorting psychedelic drugs can *intensify* the side-effects including nausea.  With the exception of DPT and 5-MeO-DMT, I just feel the oral route is the best way to go when it comes to any psychedelic drug.

Some GI discomfort was felt with insufflated doses, but not near as bad as the oral route.  The oral route made me vomit while the  insufflated route just gave me a little nausea that soon passed.

I agree with MGS that **most** psychedelics taken via insufflation can cause the side effects to be intensified (2c-t-2 for example), but with this particular compound I found that the nausea was much worse with the oral route.  However the overall body load and the general feeling of being drugged was more intense when the compound was insluffated.

**DIPT Combinations?**


Alright, I've heard and read that DIPT is pretty useless on its own but I have heard of people combining it with other psychedelics to good effect. I just wanted to see if anyone here has had any experience with DIPT combinations and see if they have any suggestions or insights. The combinations I am comtemplating are DIPT and DPT, DIPT and MDMA, DIPT and cannabis, and possibly DIPT, DPT and a small dose of MDMA. Has anyone tried any of these? Any feedback would be much appreciated.

DIPT does quite a bit on its own, just not visually.  the highest dose i've tried was 90mg, and visuals were just *barely* beginning to show; the sound distortion was quite intense.  i wouldnt mind seeing what the higher doses are like, but the trip was just so uncomfortable (physically, and just plain fucking weird) that i dont see myself doing that in the near future.


be careful with dipt+mdma; in pihkal it says that the distortions can become painful due to the intensification.

**combo's**


I've combined DIPT with 5-meo-dipt and mushrooms, the 5-meo-dipt and dipt combo can best be described as "sonic soup", truly the greatest amount of synaesthesia and tactile hallucinations I've ever experienced... crazy..


I then added about 5  grams of good cubensis, and it was an amazing night, the report will be up eventually

Why not try it with an MAOI?  Perhaps moclobemide.  Or perhaps try freebasing it.

I'll porbably try all that too, but what I'm interested in now is combinations. I'm most likely going to try DIPT with DPT tomorrow, so if anyone has tried this I'd like to hear from you.

i find music to go very well with dpt.  havent tried it with dipt or havent tried dipt at all but id imagine it makes for a strange trip.  question, are you familiar with the effects of dipt.  if so what other drug(s) do you think it would go well with?  you already mentioned the ones your interested in trying with it, so i guess those are the ones you think will work well.  complete opinion here but i think you should just combine with smoking at first to get a hang of it.  then id move up to 5meodipt maybe.  good luck and tell us how it goes!![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^^^I've never tried DIPT, and of course I'm going to try it on it's own first. As for 5-meo-dipt, that shit is digusting and I'm never putting it in my body again, so scratch that idea. I know what you mean about DPT and music. It feels like a constant mind and body orgasm![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) .

whoops, i meant tihkal.  typed faster than i was thinking there


from commentary section of [DiPT](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal04.shtml):


> Pretreatment with relatively small amounts of MDMA (35 milligrams, at between 1.5 and 2.5 hours before DIPT, at 55 milligrams) led to an exaggerated distortion, with an enhanced intensity that verged on being painful.

i took DiPT, insufflated (40mg), about 4 hours before an AMT trip. I really wount recommend mixing it with an MAOI. the AMT boosted it a fuckign retarded amount. i couldnt hear anything at times (except for a ringing), and at others everyone sounded like a really low growl. i couldnt understand music of any sort... itw as just scratching... voices sounded like large frogs. it started dissipating in anouther hour or so, and went away pretty muhc completely a few hours into the trip. bleh.

Has anyone had any experience with the free base as i have'nt heard to much about it other than from that one trip report on erowid that compares it with DMT and it may be more potent also its mentioned in TiHKAL that 8mg smoked produced a +2 so it sounds like i may have to do some research of my own.

I've tried this one at 5, 20 & 60 mg.  Has a body high & mental stimulant effects quite like 5-Meo-DiPT.  These begin with the auditory effects at ~8mg, the body high & stimulant effects seem to begin to level off around 40mg becoming more psychedelic past this point.


The auditory effects were identical to 5-Meo-DiPT & increased pretty linearly to the highest dose I tried. 


The psychedelic effects are mild & subtle yet immersive.  Reminded me most of DPT...yet totally different.  I am really at a loss to characterize them beyond this.  I think this could be an interesting compound for some to use to drive \ flavor other psychedelics...Not only because of its queer psychedelia but the profound alteration of sound gives the feeling of experiencing the world anew.


I noted much less of the peristalsis\ stomach perculating than DPT, which is pretty mild in iteself in this regard.  Same mild diuretic effects as 5-Meo-DiPT & DPT. 


The duration of the auditory effects extend well beyond the stimulant\psychedelic effects which themselves last 1-2 hours.  Slight deepening of sounds was still noticeable 24hours later with only 20mgs.


In my experience not quite the intense psychedelic described by one user on erowid but still worthwhile in iteself.  Certainly an interesting hands-on approach to structure-activity research for anyone who has tried DPT.


The conversion to freebase can be done the same as my laughably easy method for DPT hcl > base conversion [Here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showthread.php?s=&threadid=61150)  with a few differences:  1.  Freebase has a higher mp & needs a higher water temp for conversion reaction  2. Base appears to take signifigantly less volume than an equiv amount of DPT base - to minimize loss you can allow spoon to cool for 15+ mins & the base will crystallize allowing easy collection & washing if desired. 


NaOH \ Lye works a bit better\ faster than baking soda which is fine by iteself but may require slightly higher temperatures.

I just had a chance to smoke around 50mg of some DiPT freebase, I was pretty disappointed in the effects.... There seemed to be a hissing/buzzing and I heard blood pounding thru my ears... some dull geometric patterning.... I noticed effects from 4-20 minutes after smoking... fell asleep 50 min after smoking.....not as strong as a few Erowid reports let on... This didnt seem to fit in the 2 hours til baseline thats been reported....hmm

Interesting.  How did you smoke the material?  Did you use a proper DMT-freebase pipe, or some other method?  Is there a chance you didn't inhale the full 50 mg?  Also, do you have experience with oral DiPT and is your reaction to it 'normal', whatever normal is of course.

I didnt have a freebase pipe....heated the material in tin foil and inhaled thru chillum.... I got a nice billowing cloud of smoke....the smoked route intrigued me from the reports and I only had this 50mg amount so I didnt get to try orally

**Stay in bed for bed peace**


At the risk of bringing undue attention to another psychedelic that I'd hate to see become too popular and become outlawed, I will report on my experiences with it.


I took 70 mg of DiPT this weekend and was blessed with near +4 periods. In addition to the INSANE audio distortions, this drug is DEFINITELY a true, classic psychedelic. I didn't get too much in the way of visuals, save for color enhancement, flashy CEVs, and mild trails, but the mental opening and insights were beautiful. 


Although the drug was NOTHING like MDMA, that is the only thing I can think of that reminded me of the rush and feelings involved during the peak. My friend and I sat on a park bench had had some of the deepest and most insightful conversations ever. When I got home, I put on Jefferson Airplane and nearly died. Grace Slick sounded like a man, and the music sounded like it went through a digital octave-lowering device. It all sounded mechanical and synthetic. I'll never forget it. A full report will be written soon. DiPT is fantastic material. 


BTW, interestingly enough, my friend got very little from 70 mg. He mainly noticed the audio distortions and CEVs. I guess it was just my time for peak experiences and he was to act as my guide. I'm glad it worked that way. I was floored and could never have gotten home without his help.

> Click to expand...


I would liek to add that there is really no mind altering chemical that isnt controlled in some fashion by the US government. I have known people who have been arrested for possesing other quasi legal tryptamines, and would warn anyone who posseses unscheduled research chemicals to *not* flash them in a police officer's face and shout "haha, I have legal drugs." It will get you a free ride in his/her car. There are numerous laws underwhich you can be prosecuted (ie analouge act, public intoxication, public disturbance, posession of dangerous substances,  intent to distribute, etc etc). 


On a more positive tone, glad to hear people have had positive experiences with this chemical. I've always thought it sounded less than interesting, and never bothered to aquire/sample some.

Oh, I am quite aware that this chem is far from legal, and by ingesting it I broke the law.  But you know what I mean.  I don't want the kiddies looking for a new high thinking this is the shit.  Not to brag, but my words have influenced a lot of people to try things and it is a daily decision I make if I want to talk about my experiences at risk of encouraging others.

I had a very similar experience to morninggloryseed's this weekend as well. It was my 3rd or 4th time to try this substance and I decided to eyeball about twice the amount I had taken before. (i'd say approx 80-90mg). I was expecting just more audio distortion with fairly clear-headedness like before, but to my (pleasent) surprise I got a full blown trip with visuals, mental funkyness, etc. I wasnt even sure where i was anymore (not in a bad way heheh), and at the time we were listening to some demos of my band and i couldn't even recognize the music as my own.  All in all a nice, if unexpected, treat ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

That's a sign of responsibility, and I hearby comemmorate you with a cookie. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)  seriously though, the less people that become interested in this scene, the better.  I made the mistake of thinking that ANYONE who could handle lsd or mushrooms could handle a given RC like 2ci, boy was I put in my place.  Never again.  I dont even talk about them in front of other people anymore.

I took an unknown amount of DiPT several weeks ago and had GREAT results. I was sad to see that Erowid posted my trip report in the "health problems" section... it was a glowing experience IMO.


It is SO much more than an auditory drug with a body buzz. The way it alters reality is mindblowing... things are so strange and mushroom-like. Sure, it could use some more visual activity, but smoking weed definitely enhances that aspect.


here is my trip report: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23233](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23233)

**High Dipt doses**


After reading Morninggloryseed's report on DIPT, I have decided to research this chemical as well.  I'm not sure wether it was his elegant writing style, or the fact that I don't have access to any of the other exotic chemicals, but I am curious to see whether DIPT is more than just a novelity.  I have read the trip reports at erowid, bluelight, and the lycaeum so I have an idea what I am getting into, but the problem is that there are few reports written by people who took 70 mgs or more.  So...I was wondering if any of my fellow Bluelighters could indolge me with any of their DIPT experiences?  I will share my own once I begin working with this substance.

I really dislike the fact that my reports drive others to seek out chemicals.  I realize I should expect that, but it's such a double-edged sword writing them now.  I want to share the information, and I appreciate that you enjoyed reading it, but I don't want to be an influence to anyone when it comes to drugs.  ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)


I just want to say though, regardless of any posts or information people provide you with on high-dose DiPT trips...you should start off low and work your way up.  60 or 70 mg is plenty for a first try.  Even though my friend didn't trip as hard as I did, he tripped very nicely and had a wonderful time.  I sure didn't need a single milligram more than I took.  No reason to just jump in the deep waters of a pool you have never swam in.


Please be careful and use your head if you decide to experiment with DiPT, or any chemical.  I just don't want to hear you ate 1/4 gram of DiPT because you read my report and ended up in the hospital.

i've done around 90mg of the stuff.  the auditory effects were pretty disturbing at that level, and visuals were just *barely* beginning to show though, similar to a mild dose of dpt.  about 4-5 hrs into it though i developed a headache and had to knock myself out with diazapam.

I experienced disturbing auditory effects on 11 mg of 5-meO-DiPT (disturbing in that it was almost too weird for me, and I was not expecting it) but on DiPT, I found the auditory effects mindblowingly incredible.  My jaw literally dropped to the floor when I first put music on.

While I am not very experienced with the more exotic chemicals, I have done my homework on everyone of them.  My friends kind of joke with me about reading on the internet about drugs, and also doubt me when I tell them they are stating false facts about drugs.  I started learning about these and other substances in 96 on the old lycaeum site, so its not like I am just doing this cause morninggloryseed did it.  I was just saying that your post made me think that maybe there was more to DIPT than what I had read.  I am going to start low and see how my body likes the compound before I venture to higher levels.


When I read reports all people really talk about is the effects on sounds.  Does your mind stay pretty lucint during the experience, or do you get spaced out?

Off topic:  Of course trip reports make people want to try a substance.


I mean, people read 5-MeO-DMT trainwrecks, addiction to heroin, crazy 3 days trips spent with Datura induced psychosis, and they still are compelled to try them. 


Your 2C-E trip report will only encourage people to try it/seek it out.


A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from others mistakes.  There aren't that many wise people out there.


PS - I am not claiming to be wise.

**DiPT notes**


**>I was just saying that your post made me think that maybe 

>there was more to DIPT than what I had read.**


There definitely was for me.  I never expected it to produce a full-blown psychedelic trip that was so profound, magical, and wonderous as it was.  Between this DiPT trip, and last weekend's 2C-E trip, I have been lucky with entheogens lately.  As a result, I won't push my luck.   It will be sometime before I try any psychedelics again.


**>I am going to start low and see how my body likes the 

>compound before I venture to higher levels.**


Smart man.  I'm very glad to hear that.  I was at erowid today glancing at DiPT reports and was surprised to read a few reports of people taking just 20 to 30 mg and getting noticable auditory effects.  If the sound alterations are all you are after, you don't need much of the stuff.


**>Does your mind stay pretty lucint during the experience, or 

>do you get spaced out?**


I was a little disoriented at the peak as far as where we were on the bike path.  I would have had trouble getting us home if it were up to me.  But I can't say I felt fucked up at all.  I felt completely connected with everything at the peak...one with the land I was on, the energies that were there with me, and also the universe in general.  It was a classic +4 trip.  And it was very lucid; I remember every detail with complete clarity.  I'll never forget that night.


It will just be very interesting in a few months when I try it again in a similiar setting and at the same dosage.  Will I just get a body-buzz and hear weird things like most other people or will I have a true psychedelic (mind-expanding) trip again?  I can wait (and I am going to), but I sure am excited.  


Now I am not looking for or expecting a +4 again, because I realize those are rare and blessed events, but I'll be real happy if DiPT proves as insightful as it did last time.  M and I had some excellent and deep conversations, and while I was by myself I did some deep thinking about my life and my future.


I don't care if I have the entity contact again.  I'm grateful to just have had it happen this time.  But I'll be so happy if DiPT proves consistantly useful for introspection and deep-thinking.  It sure was the last time.


Plus, it was so easy on my body.  Nothing is better than an insightful psychedelic that is easy on the body.

**DiPT Freebase**


Could someone please give me the instructions on how to convert my DiPt into freebase form.  The instructions on Erowid do not give an amount for how much DiPT you put in the 10% concentrate bleach/H2O, so I have no idea how to start.  I also wanted to know if there is a method to make just a couple of doses at a time, instead of having to use a large amount of DiPT in the process.  Thank you.

go do some alternate reading from erowid for chemical conversions.  If its in a salt form youll need to basically do an acid extraction - you can find tons of info on internet, but look for serious chemistry sites dedicated to drug chemistry.


Be very careful you if you dont know what you are doing,  you could easily hurt yourself.

Your stomach acids will convert a freebase powdered drug into a hydrochloric salt.


So say you ingest DiPT freebase.. the end result is that you'll have DiPT hcl in your stomach and you'll get high as if you simply took DiPT hcl to begin with.


Since DiPT is best taken orally anyways, I don't see why you'd want to go through the trouble of trying to convert it with kitchen chemistry.

Well I was not expecting much when I loaded my bong with with some pot, 10 mgs of DiPT, and then a little more pot on top of the powder last night, but I soon learned it is a viable way to dose.  

I took one monster hit making sure to kill the whole bowl pack, and held the hit in for about 10-15 seconds.  The effects did not begin immediatly, rather it took about 30 seconds to start.  Everything in my vision began flowing.  This was much more pronounced than while on a oral dose.  A couple of minutes into the experience, my ears began to get the clogged up feeling and all of the hearing effects started.  For some reason I kept closing my eyes and drifting off.  I would get lost in thought, sometimes there were conversations going on in my head where people were talking.   

All in all, I enjoyed the effects via smoking more than I did the oral route.

Ok, well when I smoked the salt two nights ago I enjoyed it more than the oral dose of 60 mgs I ate the night before.  I enjoyed the brevity of the experience and the speed at which I came up.  I had a more visual effect.  


Last night I tried smoking it again with my freind and had mixed results.  I didn't mind wasting some DiPT so I just put it in the middle of a bowl pack, hopefully shielding it some from the flame.  I sprinkled 5 mgs in before my friend or I would take a hit.  After the first hit I definitly could feel a change in my perception, but it was not like when I took the bong hit the night before.  After three hits each, sounds were deepining and some laughing fits insoued.  


For me the oral dose of 60 mgs had a stronger effect, but I developed uncomfortable cramps and pains in my midsection at around 5 hours into the experience.  I have not experienced these cramps while smoking the DiPT.

So 60 mg orally was stronger than 10 mg smoked, huh?  But you enjoyed the smoked trip more.  Interesting.


I'd imagine some of the problems with the second day are that you were developing a bit of a tolerance.  Plus you used less.  I wouldn't do it more than once a week at most.

So you never noticed any psychedelic (mind expanding, I am not referring to the production of pretty colors when I use the word) phenomonon with DiPT?  Just auditory changes and some minor visuals?


I was lucky enough to get the whole shabang with just 70 mg.  I hope the next time I try DiPT I get mind expanding effects again because I really enjoyed my last experience.  I hope it wasn't just a one-time gift from the universe, though if it was I am forever grateful for it.


Make sure you make reports on your 4-Ho-DiPT experiences.  There is only one I know of outside of TIHKAL.  I too shall explore that compound in time, after a little break from psychedelics.  I've already had two trips this month.  Don't want to push things.

i have noticed that people either love or hate the auditory effects..


In my personal experience people who may be more geared toward using the auditory parts of their brain (musicians for example) tend to find the effects more interesting and enjoyable than people who may not be so inclined.


Most non-musical people i have observed on the stuff have little to say about it other than just "my hearing's all fucked up..." and they usually did not find it as amusing, rather they tended to find it very uncomfortable toward the end of the trip.

**DiPT- Recommended dosages**


I've searched many sources for infomation on dosages. All I can find is Shulgins experiences in TIHKAL. In it he has dosed from 30mg to as high as 250mg! I've come across an amount of it and am after a more precise amount to sample first time. Any one tried it and what dosage would you recommeded for first time? Any info. would be great![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I took 75 mg my first time and had a +4.  I found that dose more than sufficient.  My friend dosed the same and did not get past a +2.  Then a few weeks later he took 100 mg and also had a +4.  So I'd say between 75 mg and 100 mg should get you fully there.  It may be wise however to take less.  Some people find 50 mg sufficient.

I have taken dosages from 20mg up to 125mg. This is definately the most unique psychedelic i've ever had. 


For a beginner unfamiliar with its effects i would suggest starting low. Anything over about 70mg for me is pretty mind blowing, but it is still very effective at around 30-40mg. At that dosage i remain fairly clear-headed while still retaining a great deal of the audio distortion found in higher doses.

I think I'll start with 70mg. I'm very much looking forward to it. It seems so unique working primarily on the auditory instead of visual side of things.

Did you just get audio distortions from DiPT, or did you find it a true full blown psychedelic (mind-expanding substance) like I did?  It was NOTHING like anyother psychedelic I've done, but it was truly a mind-expanding material.  It did a lot more than just fuck up my hearing.  I actually had an entity contact.  I've only had that with DMT and DPT previously.

^^^The entity contact you speak of I read in Shulgin's report of a 250mg dose. I hope it's similar to DMT but without the intensity and inability to analyse the immediate effects. I've written a trip report on N,N DMT before and hope to enjoy DiPT as much. I'll write a trip report also, regardless of the experience.

My DiPT trip (I've only taken it once at this time) was DAMN strong, but at the same time it was very gentle.  Reminds me of Iprocin (4-Ho-DiPT) in that aspect.  Nothing ever felt forced, nor did I feel out of control at any time, but it was still very powerful.


What can I say about DiPT...it is perhaps the most amazing and definitelty the most unique material I've ever sampled.  I am in no hurry, but I will be very excited to sample it again.

after lots of experimenting with this stuff here is what i've found to be true at various dose ranges for **ME**. Not everyone i know had the same response (but a lot did too):


**<40mg** -  pretty much just audio distortion. Tones shifted down, male voices sound like Andre The Giant, female voices mostly unaffected. Music noticeably different but still recognizable. I am able to socialize easily at a party and i seriously doubt anybody knew i was on some crazy chemical. (aside from those who took it with me of course). All in all a fun time, but mostly a novelty at this dose.


**40-60mg** - Tones in music not only shift down, but up at times. Sometimes both at the same time. Listening to even my own music on cd is like listening to it for the first time. Only when vocals come in can i recognize a song. 

My own voice and others are completely alien. Most voices and other non-musical sounds have a digital-effect-sounding metallic tinge to them. Some minor visuals during the peak and a sense of spacial distortion and a small degree of confusion were also present. (not in a bad way)


**70-100+mg** - Comes on fast and hard (more so as the dosage increases). A strange and colorful aurora-like haze around everything. My sense of hearing is useless as a means of communication. The best way i can describe voices is that they sounded like the cantina scene from Star Wars. Alien noises coming out of my friends' mouths. Music is indistinguishable from voices and vice versa. Every sound blended together in a way i cannot put into words. I was never at a +4 on this substance but at 125mg i was at one of the highest +3's i have ever been.

It would seem that (for me at least) my brain decided just to say "screw it" with all the crazy signals my sense of hearing was trying to process. This seemed to allow me to get more lost in my own thoughts and inner workings of my mind. Sort of the same way someone in a sensory deprivation tank would.


I hope this is helpful to someone. I am really not all that great at putting my psychedelic experiences into words.

I know you asked N2O, but I am gonna chime in anyway.  I am **VERY** sensitive to tryptamines.  I actually wigged out on only 8 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT, a gentle and somewhat benign substance, though this was due in large part to the setting I took it in.


Anyway, I just wanted to say that tryptamines kick my ass and I didn't think 70 mg of DiPT was too much.  It was very intense though, but in a gentle way just like Iprocin.  I think you will be fine with 70 mg, but if you are worried then reduce it to 50 mg.

I personally don't really think 70 would be a bad first dose... should be pretty fun. The audio effects troubled some people i know at that dose but they weren't very experienced in psychedelics in general. 


I tend to be more cautious and start out low, but i'm a big wuss ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Bad advice on my part!  One never know's how they will react.  I found DiPT POWERFULLY psychoactive at 70 mg.  I don't know if I can say that dose is good for beginers knowing some people are more sensitive to psychoactives than I am.  Shulgin, if I recall, lists dosages as being 25 mg to 100 mg.  So I'd say start at 25 to 50 mg your first time.


I still haven't taken DiPT since that first exposure.  It will be interesting to explore it again.

Personally I was very bored with 50 mgs. The rich auditory effects were novel for the first hour or so, but didn't develop into anything interesting after that. Very mild visuals .Transparent tryptamine body buzz. Thats about it. Should I bother to up the dosage? Did I take too little? 


I've read all of these freakin transcendental trip reports, so why is it so boring? 


Is this just a dosage issue? 


Perhaps partially set and setting influence? I did take it with a sort of random friend: e-tarded suburban gangster poet and whatnot? 


Of course none of you fucks can answer these questions. Just a representation of my experiences with the sedate and lull-worthy DIPT. Anyone else interpret the dipped state as frustration?

May as well add  my comments; took 70mg or so (long time ago) orally. The auditory was interesting for an hour or 2 then was unpleasant & isolating - making conversation/comprehension difficult. There was a slightly metallic tryptamine stimulation that eventually became annoying too. The worst of it for me was the intense feeling of pressure in the ears; this was a plugged feeling like when one is ill and was distrubing as was the constant high pitched tinnitus that went on all evening. another time tried 50mg - hardly any auditory + the stimulation - it still lasted a good 12hrs - was essentially not very nice & pointless. others had some better luck - but all the experimenters I knew personally considered it just a try once novelty.

I am interested by reports of psychedelic action at the high end of the dosage scale - but I'm not sure I could face taking this stuff again certainly orally. Insufflation sounds more interesting - is this stuff as rough to snort as DPT?

ouch.. don't snort this stuff unless you want to feel INTENSE pain! Trust me i made this mistake once and never will get that shit anywhere near my nasal passages again.


Plus it didn't really seem any different from oral, other than the INTENSE PAIN!

Perhaps I won't bother then - DPT was the worst stuff I ever snorted (& I have snorted tons of alsorts) although the dosage is about x2 that of DIPT so it may not be as bad.

Funny you didn't like it much Bip.  Stuff we have in common, well that's what gave me the +4 at 70 mg.  And there wasn't any bodyload or anything negative to report on.  DiPT is a fantastic indolic psychedelic to me, up there with LSD, iprocin, DPT and 5-MeO-DMT.  At the same time, I only tried DiPT the one time so I can not say that it will be quite the same when I revisit that space.  2C-T-2 comes to mind...it was excellent the first time, but the next three were shitty.


I wish time (or rather lack there-of) and current screwed-up body chemistry allowed me to try psychedelics.  It will be awhile before I get to do anymore experiments.

**DiPT**


Must say, i like DiPT a very lot. Did PsiloShrooms, LSD, MDMA, Datura and Hashish, Amphetamine, but this is best I've met.


I expected something like the sound effect would be not too big deal, rather expected tryptamine-buzz.

First time, I just started eating DiPT, without any scale, and came at a +4.

I then gave some other interested beings a somewhat litler dose (as people trust me and would eat it at once for sure) One said he didn't hear too much sound difference, only in voices, but had rather visual influences. The other one has to give his report.


For me it works very relaxing, clear thinking (not losing the practical side of thinking too quickly, I like that, Psilo and LSD do fuck that  a bit, although at peak moment, my handwriting became nothing, and I wasn't busy anymore with doing something. I had total euforia, and very intresting thinking. Most trip-stuff tends to make you a 'weak' social being, very easy manipulated, wishing for hippypeace and stuff (you wouldn't survive otherwise) Not with DiPT (with me at least)


It's also very suited to get somewhat angry, you tend to relativate the situation, feel the impact of the situation, but still leave you going in what you want to say, no problem. In fact you keep calm and relaxed, but you will definitly not just let you put aside or start feeling bad about yourself.


I used DiPT in lower doses (20-50 mg), somewhat 2 times a week, for the last month (one time can be 3 doses in one day, I see it as 1 time), still feel great, Had no adverse reactions, and helps a phokking lot with going out where the music is too damn soft. (I listen HarshNoise, Terror, Hardkore, Extreme Gabber and stuff, don't like the mellow shit too much, except when I snorted big deal of amphetamines (Amphetamines make people a bit melancholic, nostalgic in some way, je sais pas...)


using MDMA same day you used DiPT (after it) is rather boring I would say, you can better stay clean after a DiPT trip than taking some MDMA in my opinion. Shulgin mentioned extreme distortion when first taking MDMA, then DiPT, Gonna try that next time, even when i took great dose first time, sound was very noticable (as noticable as aphrodisiac and sense-enhancer, and euforiac) but still, I'd like far more. (I'm Musician)


Very interesting, also, I make video art, was experimenting with, yea, how you call it, mantra-eyeball-geometricpattern alike experiments, and DiPT does not produce any visuals for me, but the images that are there produce more intense effect. I sure gonna try a DiPT dose in cinema!


Also when speaking to someone: I can feel the words, most noticable when speaking about fear: you feel fear (not that you really get into fear), when you speak about lust, you feel the lust, etcetera, you feel other people's words, (or at least your own interpretation of those words)


Also, I read a report of someone suggesting not to drink too much or eat, well, I definitly say the opposite, when not eating, the day after I feel somewhat stiff iin the legs (it's not much at all) but when eating, body load is far less (well, it is not much at all when staying hungry too)

I have to admit it feels specifik in the stomach, maybe some people associate it with a vomit-alike feeling, and 'think' they have to vomit, but it's just some strange stomach feeling (I like the feeling in fact![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Does anyone else find, that, even lower end doses, seem to cause a very strong audio distortion, without much of a psychedelic effect, but the audio distortion lasts over 24 hours? sometimes two days? (gradually fading)


Sometimes it could just be a simple thing, like, your phone ringing, beeps in your car, the microwave beeping, catching your attention because its still a little 'off'.


I did not have fun the one time i eyeballed a dose, it was from a different supplier so that could have had something to do with it, but sound became like others said, so fucked my ears were useless.  Also, I have a 'tinnitus' (sp?) effect that lasts well long enough to annoy me, also making everything a little quieter especially closer to the higher audio frequencies.


This last time, I ate the capsule, but ended up taking a nap for a few hours.  I woke up, only could hear that ringing sound, i couldnt even hear my loud cell phone ringing when it did.  I did see visuals like the floor moving/morphing, but since i was sleepy, I just said ahh I do not want to go into the other parts of the house because I know there's a "sober, closed minded" guest staying, so, i went back to sleep (and i was tired anyway).  The damn sound effects left me "deaf" for maybe, 12-18 hours, well maybe even 24, where i wasn't completely deaf but i still could not understand voices.


I might have some sensitivity to dipt, or, whatever-dipt or anything with a dipt in it.  5-meo-dipt had a major sound effect that I also could hear a little into the next day, but not too bad.  I've never heard of anyone reporting sound distortion with 4-HO-DIPT, but I could notice it, definitely made things lower pitched, but not enough to bother me at all.  It made music sound real good, but I could hear that wierd distortion 'slightly' ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

No, never had,

only sound come stronger on foreground in my world of perception, and sudden sounds, sound very sudden and hard day(s) after.

I like it a lot, I am longer addicted to sound stimulation as I know DiPT, psychedelics or drugs in fact ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


Maybe you're marked for DiPT HPPD? who knows....


There are subtle changes who last some litl time, but nothing like that, small doses don't fuck my sound too much either.

And never had the feeling anything was fokked in fact. Also never had problems coming to sober people who didn't know I had taken it, sometimes it even seemed I was an enormous amusing person to some while under influence for those sober people, communicative senses stay, or maybe get, s very sharpened rather then destroyed. (Although maybe you can be perceived a bit manic too maybe, I don't know, too amusing isn't too natural too![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find DiPT very empathic, not like mdma at all, rather natural, you are not forcing yourself and others in interaction, but interaction goes very well.

And doesn't stay limited to plain friendliness/loviness, rather true feelings get expressed, then drug-induced feelings. (I say rather, their is drug in game so...)


I would be carefull, no-one I know has had that kind of effects...


I know of people who had visual experiences, sometimes more profound then auditory.

I had intense auditory distortions the one time I tried DiPT, and also when I took 11 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT.  Neither lasted into the next day though.  I've tried 5-MeO-DiPT 3 times and only noticed the auditory effect with 5-MeO-DiPT at 11 mg.  At 6 mg, and 8 mg it wasn't there.  And that 8 mg trip was at a concert.


Never noticed any auditory distortions with 4-Ho-DiPT.  I've tried that one 5 times now.

PICK UP THE PHONE


Taking 50 mg DIPT, 16 mg 2C-I, and 50 mg Booster of DIPT 2 hrs later


Many people seem to have had unfavorable reactions to this chemical.  Perhaps this is because it requires that you learn how to trip all over again.  The large auditory component has the disconcerting effect of altering our chief means of communication.  Unlike many visual hallucinogens, which tend to produce strong, if inconsistent visuals (i.e. you aren't seeing OEV throughout the entire trip), DiPT alters your sense of hearing for all hours of the trip.  When you are unable to identify a good friend's voice, let alone your own -- even as you are staring at them -- it can be quite strange.  For instance, a friend of mine, with a very deep voice, spent several hours (4+) sounding as if his speech were being processed through a synthesizer.  The intense auditory hallucinogens became particularly strong following smoking a bowl after the booster.  Two people who were tripping remarked that they felt was like "moving underwater" because of the strong sense of disorientation and disconnectedness (without nausea, however).  For another, listening to music took on a playful characteristic.  Voices took on strange melodies, which diverged into dischordant (yet beautiful and pleasing) harmonies.


2C-I is a good chemical to mix in because it is such a gentle hallucinogen.  We like to think of it as candy flipping for nerds.  It makes you much more responsive to the new sensations you are feeling and adds a layer of color and highly enjoyable body high.  


The 'pick up the phone' comment is in reference to the experience of picking up the phone and listening to the dial tone when having ingested a fair amount of DiPT.  The strange, foreign quality of the normally ordinary and pedestrian sound will most certainly alert you to having finally 'come up'.

Is that based on your friend's reactions, or based on the psychedelic community's reaction in general?


I've never really heard anything negative about DiPT other than some experiencing nausea or other intestinal issues.  Many people seem to find it to be an audio distorter, and nothing more.  Others (like me) find DiPT to be an incredible, and very unique, true psychedelic.  But again, never heard of any negative reports as I do with, say, 5-MeO-DiPT where even the inventor admited it is a "mixed bag" and that many folks find it useless for entheogenic purposes, and to possess a high body-load.


I'd love to know of any negative reactions to DiPT that you may personally know about.  Please include the dosage if possible.


DiPT is one of the few psychedelics I've tried that has made it into the "good material, useful; this is stuff I would love to share with my inner circle" list.  But having only tried it once myself, I do not know much about it beyond my personal experience and what little literature is available, as well as the trip reports on Lycaeum and Erowid.  And I want to know of any serious side-effects if I were to ever share DiPT.

I played around with DiPT for a month or two, in various dosages, and have no side effects, except some intestinal discomfort sometimes when I took it.

apparently you missed my DiPT trip report on Erowid in "Health Effects"


After using DiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT, I experience an explosion of small red dots on my skin that can only be described as lesions. I also experience a huge increase in spider veins on my feet that started when I first tried foxy.


[The Blind Fox: A DiPT report](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=23233) 


I had posted some pictures on the Third Plateau, but my Angelfire account was TOSed and I have no backups. Next time I tryp, I will certainly post some pictures of this bizarre side effect.

it seems to me that dipt and 5-meo-dipt are not the same substance!


Inever had 5-meo-dipt, and never will, because I avoid things with known body load.


You're report talks about not drinking and eating, well I just say the opposite, drink as much as you want/need (normally) eat if you are hungry (although the altered sound perception degrades very quick by eating)


I read this before trying dipt for first time, and felt uncomfortable with my empty stomach and went eating pita. (shoarma)


no problems at all


be aware that it is not because they are both dipt at the end, they are the same in toxicity.

maybe the not psychedelic active 67-fluorobromoethylpropyl-DiPT kills you at once at a dose of 7mg? (I just say a name, it doesn't exist)


I only did dipt (and very litl bit, small amount, occasional on party: amphetamine and mdma) also almost no alcohol, and a period of no coffee (although I'm back now there) and lot of cigarettes and hashish


no 5-meo, no other RC's, no anything


(I don't have spiders yet... 'except one litl I have since I know my own existence)


and maybe you're lesions have something to do with your food. (be aware with drugs and food, as your healthy lusts can be disturbed, getting out of the right balance in body provisions, etc...)


tryptamines are normally carefully synthesized in your body out of food. Be aware of that when you just take em.


I do not use dipt daily, just weekly, or two-times-a-weekly.


Cigarettes are doing my body much harm......

Most of all I know (except being drunk maybe...or 7 strong coffees)

oh, and the stomach discomfort on DiPT is nothing more than tryptamines flowing in the body, it's not your stomach but your solar-plexus, it's an important energy path in the body, allowing you to dance, breath deeply, and have great sexual experiences (and so much more that involves letting the body go into it's own creativity)


you only get ill of it if you think it is you're stomach, while it is just tryptamine body-sensation

**mdma & dipt**


I tried combining Dipt with mdma in two ways.


one time I first did dipt (around 20mg 2 times), and after a few hours a little dose (around 30mg) of mdma.


effect were sudden all egal and pretty boring, distant.

definitly not worthful in fact, they messed up the pleasure of it. (not feeling bad or something, but not dynamic at all)


then I did 20 mg mdma, followed by 20 mg dipt two hours later.

effects where rather strong, strong solar-plexus-stimulation, audio affects lasted untill the other day (around 16-18 hours after swallowing the dipt)

stimulation was too strong too concentrate on making or listening music


Everytime I take dipt it is very different, with the audio effect and the body buzz as a constant through the times.


I suspect (in a hypothetical way) that maybe this substance interacts strongly with possibly serotonin, or maybe adrenalin neurotransmitters.


I think this because small doses (5-10mg) can be boosted in some way even with caffeine (although too much can higher caffein load too) which interacts with serotonin and adrenalin, so does mdma.


maybe it's dopamine it interacts with, also possible, sometimes smoking a cigarette makes me very aware that i took dipt, just as coffee and tea do.


I can't know. But I strongly suspect that it it's way of action interacts with some major neurotransmitter.


it's difficult to guess where you come, same amount can give a neutral feeling, (like not much effect at all), they can be strongly euphoric, very dry too, mood can be elevated, but not necessarily.. audio effects are not always the same strength.


Other possibilty is ofcourse that it depends on the condition of your stomach for big part. maybe it is not the easiest substance to get to your brain and thus it depends very much what state your insides are.


Has anyone tried DiPT with MOAI's? (Be CareFull if...!!!)

I developed an interest in this compound, but I noticed that Erowid dosen't have a dosage range, or maybe I didn't look hard enough.  What would be a considerable dosage range for oral DiPT in the light, medium, strong ranges?

Weird, I could have sworn there was a dosage range on Erowid, but i must have hallucinated it, ha ha.


All I could find to go by is [TIHKAL](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/tihkal/tihkal04.shtml), wherein it looks like ~15mg is threshold, 50mg moderate, up to 250mg (!) for what i assume is a very heavy dose. But the comments with each of these doses do not seem to vary enough to give me any confidence in them. E.g. the comments at 250mg do not seem all that more intense than at 25. *Sigh*, TIHKAL.... 8) 


Maybe someone else has personal experience to share on this.

I have personal experience with DiPT.  70mg was enough to get me to a STRONG +3.  A friend needed 100mg.  But start low.  I found DiPT rather strong.

10 mg comes at latent treshold (you can only notice when you know what it is at higher doses)

20mg is treshold where 'trip'-effects start to appear

around 30 mg works fine

around 50 mg works very well


didn't do more


my weight is about 57 kg


(most pharmaceutical dosages are calculated i thought for people around 70kg, not sure)


Tihkal speaks of dosing between 25-100 mg

but this scales are relative, subjectif and personal, they depend on what ones find to be 'minimum'effect and when start thinking it gets too much.


But I think it's a good scale, I don't think one will get hurt with 100 mg, but effects can be strong.

I tried DiPT for the first time recently, 70mg. The effects were marred by my stupid decision to add an accidentally large dose of DXM on top of it (I don't really recommend this combo, although parts of it were incredible).


The auditory effects were nothing short of astounding. They took a while to manifest -- I lost track of time but I'm sure they weren't even discernible until the 70-90 minute mark. I was listening to some Beck and all of a sudden his band seemed to completely lose the ability to play their instruments. The key started shifting at least once per bar, and the bass would keep landing on these crazy wrong notes. It sounded like a clown band! Then I put on one of my own band's CDs and just sat and shook my head in amazement. For a musician, listening to your own work on DiPT is a real treat.


What was interesting was that I could sing along perfectly on songs where I knew the melody. I could also focus in on one individual instrument's line and have it sound mostly normal -- it was the relative pitches of all the other instruments that would be crazy and skewed.


Later I turned on the TV and I had almost no clue what anyone was saying. After a while this became disturbing and I switched it off.


I was most surprised at how long the effects persisted. Voices were still pitch-shifted down at the 6-8 hour mark. This combined with the flanging effect of the DXM for some really wild stuff. It sounded *exactly* like a vocal effect Aphex Twin uses on one of his records. AT one point somebody called and left a message on the machine, and I played it bak five times trying to understand it. I kept getting snippets, but the meaning of it kept fading in and out. 


There was some nausea on the come-up, but I didn't puke. (Well, not until I took DXM.) My ears were still ringing the next morning, pretty bad. 


Next time I will make sure not to mix this with anything else, so I can better understand DiPT's psychedelic effects on its own. But the audio effects are, IMO, well worth it alone.

Well, I finally got around to trying this one.  Took a 66mg capsule 50 minutes ago.  I am already starting to notice definite wierd audio effects.  When I turn my head to the side, the tone of the air sounds different than when my head is faced forward.  Wierd.  I'll report the results later.  This is going to be VERY strange, I have a feeling...

Hmmm... I didn't like it, really.


It's not like what I took was too much, or anything, I just really wish it would go away.  The audio effects were kinda interesting for a while, but now it's just a little annoying, and I'm looking forward to when my hearing is back to normal.  I'm trying hard to figure out what it is about it that I don't like, but I can't really put a finger on it.  It's a kind of stimulation that I don't really enjoy, and I didn't even find 2C-I stimulating... 

I really want to listen to some music, but it's so horrible I can't even keep it playing (I pretty much expected this though)

Eh, I don't think I'll explore this one any further.

^^ That's interesting. I found the distortions annoying after a while too. I might agree with you in general that this one is not that worthwhile, but not until after I've tried DiPT on its own. As it is I can't tell whether I blame it, or DXM, for making me feel like I wanted the trip to end. 


It's interesting isn't it that visual distortions don't seem to get as annoying, or interfere with enjoyment, the way audio distortions do? Maybe it really would suck more to be deaf than to be blind....

Well, only you can answer that for yourself - but I'd say, it could very well have been the DIPT.  Because that's exactly how I feel, I just want it to end.  I mean it's not horrible and I'm not it any pain, it's just kind of uncomfortable...  And my fuckin' music is broken!   lol...


Yeah it is interesting how the audio distortions get annoying, but visual distortions don't.  That is wierd.  I think for one thing, it's because it ruins music - and I love music.  But, I dunno... I still can't explain why exactly I don't like this.

I sure found it worthy.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  I'd have to list it among my favorite.  And not for the weird audio distortions, but for the incredible entheogenic effects.  Though the audio part was fantastic.  I will never forget listening to the Airplane and hearing Grace Slick sound like a man

At the dose I took, I didn't really GET a whole lot of effects other than the audio...  I mean there was a little, but it was so weak it wasn't even worth reporting.  


MGS you seem to be a lot more sensitive to tryptamines than me, I wonder if maybe I just need to take a higher dosage to get the type of the effects you and some others describe?  I have a feeling that may be the case, it seems I always have to take higher dosages...  I don't know if it's worth it though, my hearing is FINALLY starting to get back to normal now and I'm rather glad to have it back!

You may.  When I took DiPT, I took it with a friend.  We both took 70mg.  He did not trip as I did.  A month later, he took 100mg and had the same type of entheogenic breakthrough that I did.  In fact, he said he experienced the same entity contact that I did.


I've only had DiPT the one time, but I look foward working with it again.

Well I may have to rethink whether I'm going to try it again then - you said the magic word, "breakthrough".  I've always had a feeling there's a breakthrough point with DIPT, and after reading a few more reports on it, and hearing what you say, I know there must be.  I just hope the audio effects don't get any stronger with higher dosages...  (or LAST LONGER!)


It certainly wouldn't surprise me if, once again, I needed a higher dosage of something to get where others get with a lower dosage... 


Thanks for your input!

**Dipt**


Hi, i have searched for days on end on dipt. and from what ive learned that its active at about 25-30mg,psychedelic at 60-100mg. I aquired 200mg's two weeks ago. My friend took 30-35mg to test the waters. Hes very experienced in chems and psychs. He said for an hour he just felt extra high, and after two hours his ears popped like on a airplane and everything was a pitch lower. He was smoking pot too. Ive held off on  this substance for a couple weeks. He says there was absolutly no tryptamine buzz, no mind fuck or psychedelic effects at all. more of a novelty they would sell at a store too make everything sound a pitch lower, is how he described it. I am contemplating takin 50-60mg but my friend said " i  mean yea it might be psychedelic but at that dose i think it would just be plain wierd w/ uncomfortable audio and body effects" So i am not sure. Ive read MG seeds report on it bieng pretty damn psychedelic. I am wondering in what way is it psychedelic? like mindfuck,body buzz? what?

It's still psychedelic, but much less noticeably so than many other chemicals. I would put it on the order of 2C-T-21 or another mild PEA in terms of overall strength of psychedelic effects. I think part of it is that the audio stuff is so weird it distracts you from what other effects there are.


This should be merged into the Big DIPT Thread.

Not sure if you are suggesting that weight plays a factor with indole/PEA psychedelics, but it doesn't.  I've tripped with many different folks, people of all shapes and sizes, and there was never any correlation/connection between level of intensity/effects and one's body weight or fat levels.

I think I did as good a job as possible in describing my DiPT trip.  I can't think of what else I could add.  The report was very detailed and you should be able to understand "what way" I found it psychedelic.  And a body-buzz has nothing to do with "psychedelic," or rather I would not label a body-buzz as a psychedelic (mind-expanding) effect.  Perhaps read the report again.  Sometimes when I read something again, I seem to "pick up more" than I did the first time.  Maybe you will get more if you do.

I'd have to disagree with you here.  I found the experience VERY powerful.  70mg brought me to a strong plus-three that at times (when I experienced the sense of mystical oneness with everything as my ego slipped away and I became one with the rock I was on and the stream I was sitting by) went into a plus-four experience.  A friend was with me and he took the same dosage as I did.  But at 70mg, he got nothing more than auditory distortions, and some minor visuals.  But no real psychedelic (mind-manefesting/expanding) effects.  Kind of what many who dismiss DiPT seem to experience.  I thought I had a unique, one-of-a-kind trip but a few weeks later he took 100mg and, at that level, it brought my friend to a very similar place that I got to with 70mg.  He even experienced a meeting with a computer-blip sounding spirit that sounded like the one I met from his description.


Though I've never taken 2C-T-21, I hear it frequently compared to 2C-C in terms of depth.  And DiPT sure beat 2C-C in intensity and depth, hands-down.  I believe, and my friend also feels this too, that DiPT is very set and setting dependant.  This psychedelic seems to "open the mind" mostly through the auditory channel.  It is through that sense that "information" is obtained.  I had the entity contact, and it was an auditory thing.  I could feel the presence of many beings, but could not see them like with DMT.  And then one started communicating with me.  Well, it is all in the report I wrote so I won't rehash it again.


But yeah, DiPT is best experienced at night in complete silence.  And I believe it works best in nature.  I took it by a stream coming down from the rocky mountains.  If taken in this kind of setting, I'll bet everyone would have a very special experience.  No one should dismiss DiPT as a mere novelty until they try it in a similar setting as I did.  I believe only then, will the real nature of DiPT begin to be experienced.  Though I'm glad it's not popular.  It's one of the best and I'd really hate to lose that one.  Not just because *I* enjoy it and find it useful, but because it is a facinating tool to study auditory perception.  Someone needs to figure out how to radiolabel it, and see where it goes.

I can believe that. My highest dose was 70mg. I tend to be less sensitive than most to psychedelics, so it's entirely possible a ~100mg dose would break the psychedelic threshhold for me. I'll have to try it someday. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Okay, I like to write creatively while tripping and this compound intrigues me because it appears to have little visual distortion (if any). However, I would like insights and revelatory information... will DiPT offer this (is that what the "breakthrough" is about?). Also, would I still be able to discern words spoken and be able to keep up a verbal conversation (i.e., to a cop, parent, teacher, etc.)? Thanks.

On 30mg DiPT, I had no trouble communicating with people.  At that dose, I only noticed mild sound distortion; however, there was a moderate tryptamine push, along with slight visual enhancement/distortion (not sure which).  Generally all these effects are subjective so what works for me may not for you.  


As an example, after taking 30mg of DPT via IM, (what I consider a moderate dose) I held a normal conversation with my friend's grandfather.  This is something that normally would have freaked me out had I taken a different substance or dose, yet I was fine in this case.


DiPT gave me minimal thought distortion, so if your mind-set is good & strong I wouldn't predict any problems, but assuming it's your first time, it's better to be somewhere safe to see how DiPT affects you.

I was fairly conversant and normal on 55mg. 70mg was pushing it. More than that would probably be unadvisable for tripping on the down-low.

I love DiPT!  I've ingested it three different ways: insufflated, smoked, and IM'ed - each produced radically different effects.


Insufflated always produced an auditory experience with very little psychedelic properties.


Smoked (HCl salt): always produced very sever psychedelic effects but very little body/auditory effects.


IM: I only IM'ed this twice, once at 15mg and once at 25mg with 40mg DPT.  The first time was just a normal experience, similar to 20mg insufflated.  The second time was radically different.  The DiPT synergized so well with the DPT I did not recognize either drug.  The auditory effects were unlike anything I had heard before and the psychedelic reality shone through with a brilliance matched only by my 5-MeO-DMT experiences.  Combine that with the most realistic visuals I have ever seen and it was a great learning experience.  It's something I wish very much to repeat, but I have to be very careful.  I couldn't communicate with anyone and was not ready for the depths I was taken to.


I have yet to try DiPT orally, but IM seems to be the way to go.  I would like to experiment with oral DiPT combined with IM DPT, but I'm holding off on that for a while.

Fragbait, I find it interesting that you have tried dipt just about everyway except eating it.  Why?  I seem to recall you mentioning that the dosing was very hard to predict by this route, but how did you come to this conclusion without first hand experience?(sorry if you didn't make this comment, but I think I saw in an Erowid trip report)  It just seems interesting that the overwhelming majority of reports I read involve people eating it, quite successfully.  And a quick rundown of how each different methode varies would be helpfull(duration, body load, ect)

Well, when I first obtained this drug I was a poor college student trying to find every way to make the most of my drugs.  So I insufflated instead of eating it.  I don't do that sort of thing anymore - I'll never snort DiPT again.  The reason I thought DiPT was hard to predict orally is just an assumption I have based on all of the experiences I've read.  Some people take 25mg and say the auditory effects last for 24 hours, others take 150 mg and get nothing but auditory effects, which are gone by bedtime.  Then there are people like MGS who have +4's on 70mg.  Yet in my experience, people who snort 20mg always get about the same level of effets, and the same for insufflating 40mg.


Here's the requested rundown:


Snorted: alert in t+10m, peak in t+45m, down in t+4h

Some report very strong, positive bodyload, but I never got that.


IM'ed: alert in t+7m, peak in t+ 30m, down in t+4

About the same as insufflated, but I got a good bodyload, it was smoother coming up and down (but more intense), and of course you don't have to deal with burn or drip.


The DPT+DiPT combo has been my favorite for quite some time.  I've only experienced it once, but it sent me into the strongest +3 I've ever had, until I broke into a +4 where I was aware of only the drugs.  It was the first time I had experienced a true psychedelic trance, where I was taken there by the drug and not by myself.  I came out of it believing I finally knew what experiences all of the famous names in the psychedelic world are talking about.  I remembered a report by MGS about sitting on his favorite rock, and I thought I knew what we wrote about.  I've never had a thumbprint, but I can't imagine it being much more instense than that.


Definately not for everyone.

Thanks for the info, thats exactly what I was looking for.  I agree that the threat of not hearing right for a good 24 hours has made me very selective in choosing a time to taste this one.  Well, we'll see how long it does last...

A very wise choice - for my first experience with this chemical, I was not as selective as I should have been as to a good time to do it, and I ended up having to go to the store with my mom, who sounded like a man...  wrong, so wrong...

Yeah, it is kind of interesting talking to normal people and trying to play it off like they DON'T sound like evil robots...   But this can get a little un-nerving after a while!   At least it did for me... maybe on a smaller dose, it wouldn't be so bad.

I would post this in the Trip Reports forum, but I don't type a lot so I'll put it here.


I am somewhat of a lightweight when it comes to most drugs.

I ate DiPT for the first time today at 10am (30mg), fell asleep for about 25-30 minutes, then got up and left to eat breakfast.  I live in the dorm at college, so I have to go to the lunchroom about a block away.  I went inside and got some food.  I had cereal, eggs, and sausage.  I ate the cereal and some of the other stuff but soon felt really sick.  It smelled really salty and greasy and almost made me vomit.  I couldn't eat it so I got up to leave, starting to shake.  I got back to the dorm at about 11am, then curled up on my bed about 15 min, feeling a lot of nausea and anxiety.  I went to the bathroom and got diarrhea.  When I got back to my room I felt GREAT.  It was even better than oxycodone.  For the next 5 hours or so I played some music on my piano and listened to CD's to hear the weird sound alterations.  I couldn't believe the intense euphoria I had on this, I really didn't expect it.  I also smoked about 5mg of 5-MeO-DMT around noon, which was awesome.


If I was using Shulgin's scale, I would say this trip was a +2, and a +4 when I took the 5-MeO-DMT.


I think next time I take DiPT, I'll go to a party with helium balloons, and maybe get some nitrous oxide to experiment with voice pitch.

I did 50mg yesterday . Was not enought , i decided to take an other 50mg about 1.5 hour later .


The little buzz is ok , but nothing realy great . For the sound distortion , i dont like it . Look like this stuff stick in your throat and block EARS to nose or mouht passage . I dont think this drug affect the brain for the sound , i think it block everything like if you got flu .  I still feel everything is blocked in my ears and its now more than 16hours after i took the stuff .


If i block my nose with my finger and push air , i can taste something like 5 meo dmt . 


THe little buzz got some anxiete and paranoiya ,  i cant believe this crap is legal .


dipt is not good at all and i almost think its dangerous  imo .

^^^ How did you "do" your DiPT? Nose? Mouth?


100 mg DiPT is a rather large dose anyway. But may I ask if you're on any meds?


And I *really really* doubt that DiPT's action on hearing is because it *psysically* blocks them! 


Though I am glad people are not liking it. This means lower peices and later scheduling forthose who do, yay! lol.

I've done DiPT (orally) a few times now (30mg each time).  Every time I've had a harsh comeup.  I get nausea, anxiety, and diarrhea, but luckily it only lasts about 30 min at the most.  Does anyone else get this?  Should I just let it happen or is there something I can do to make it more comfortable?

I get slightly more nausea and related anxiety from DIPT than from other tryptamines. But the dose (for me) is much higher: I got some nausea from 70mg DiPT, not really any from 55mg. Never gone as low as 30mg.


The answer: smoke a little pot immediately after dosing. Too much can increase the anxiety but 1-2 hits for me just smooths out the nausea.

The last time I did DIPT I really noticed how during the peak of the auditory effects it made me feel partially deaf, like my head was "blocked" as you say, in addition to the pitch shift downward. Most sounds were very faint and the world seemed very far away.


An interesting side effect of this, which my wife pointed out, was that I would compensate by talking too loud, and too high. She kept asking me if I was doing one of my "funny" cartoon character voices, although I sounded completely normal to myself. This made me very self-conscious at the time, but now I think it's pretty damn hilarious.

Well at 20mg's, DiPT produced a real effect lasting for about 5 hours. During the comeup, there were minor visuals but they faded away after 30-45 minutes. There was very little in the way of side-effects at this amount. However, when the dosage was doubled to 40mg's, the experience became somewhat unpleasant. There was a tremor and noticable vasoconstriction, the auditory effect seemed even more pronounced and this lasted for 8 hours. The visuals seemed like a cross between small amounts of 2C-I and DPT but with the 40mg's they only appeared for about 45 minutes to 1 hour. A FOAF took 30mg's and found the auditory effects to be disturbing. This lead to dysphoria and acute derealization. The auditory effect for this FOAF lasted about 4 hours. 


Do the minor visuals of MiPT seem similar to DiPT in anyones opinion?

I found DiPT (at 70mg) much more visually active than MiPT (at 20mg).  I can't even compare them as the visuals were totally different, with DiPT producing this green "strobe light' effect and strong CEVs.  MiPT produced none of this.  However, I took the MiPT during the day and the DiPT at night.  With the settings so different, I hate to come to any conclusions.

I would like to share my first test drive in the wonderful world of dipt.


it really is so much more than the "auditory one" - calling it that is really not doing it justice. The experience took place just a couple of days ago. 


3:15pm = ingestion of carefully weighed out 22mg of the recently obtained material. prior to ingestion I had eaten a bowl of salad. Forest walk follows almost immediately after ingestion. I start my Qi Gong exercises in the forest and realise shortly afterwards (roughly T+ 20) that all is not quite as it always is, but I am still unsure. "First alert" could be a red herring, you never know what is placebo when you are full of expectations. 


3:45 = hmm... subtle changes in energy field perceived. Everything is so clear and I can focus on everything deeply, just not for very long. That mushroom feeling when you have eaten 2 or 3 little shrooms and you start coming up that tiny bit.


3:55 = I am definitely no longer able to hold it together. When I concentrate, I am realyl there, but there seems little continuity to what I'm doing. restlessness and impulsive tendencies are setting in.


4:00 = was that only 5 minutes? maybe I should go home...


4:10 - 4:30  sitting on the sofa ... remembering the walk home, where sounds became a bit muffled and my ears felt like ater a plane trip . . .poster on the wall is doing interesting things. who said dipt was not visual? not majorly so, but it does breathe and spin a bit, this cosmos on the wall... pleasant bodily sensations, nothing too strong, though . . .


I realise that my routine behaviour is not setting in all by itself . . . I am free to do what I want. well, I always am, but this strikes me very powerfully just now. More than on other RCs.


my partner's voice is getting pretty deep... a bit metallic . . . she has to leave . . . I'm alone . . . still not putting any music on ... see what other effects there are and a bit apprehensive about whether I'll be freaked out... go to my room . . . I read a bit, and reading is much easier then expected . . .some sexual exploration seems in order . . . playing with self is very very pleasant, and I can circulate my sexual energy and take it to any part of my body (well, almost, this is a skill I am still learning - though I feel that this drug might be a very useful companion for energy work exploration, sexual or other), and after a while of that and a few threshold orgasms I leave it at that withiut ejaculating. I feel wonderfully balanced, no desire for more of that despite the sudden decision to just stop and do sth else.


Ended up chatting a bit online and listening to music... now THAT was weird. Sachiko M & william Basinski & other experimental things sounded fairly normal (well, do they ever?) - perhaps more accessible than usual, but when I put on Nick cave I quickly decided that this wasn't a good time for this sort of sound . . .  deep techno also sounded just so deep I thought it was from the darkest recesses of hell... and so metallic... voices so frog-like and metallic . . . lost track of time during all that.


6:00 Phonecall. Stupid me answers it. It's mum. But no problem. I decided not to compensate for my own perceived deep voice because hers sounded so deep and frog-like as well . . . had no idea whether I was talking too fast or too slow but decided not to let it bother me. Done in 5 minutes and no problems at all. Still, why do I anaswer the phone in this stae? I should know better.


6:15 A slight restlessness started coming back and I decided to lie down and listen to some binaural beat-based chakr/astral travel recording that I'm very familiar with in order to see what that would do. I was also unsure at this stage whether I was still coming up or peaking . . . decided it must be the peak after all, or perhaos even post-peak. As soon as that realisation came, I thought "maybe I should have taken more" . . . while before I thought "maybe it was too much?"


Anayway, with the time distortion still going strong, I heard details in that recording that I had never noticed before, and all the sounds were indeed so much deeper than usual. The recording seemed to be much much slower. And the voice was incredibly deep and metallic, like a computer. The effect was stronger than usual, and I realised once again how I can tune in to the subtle energy body that surrounds me and runs through me. Very nice.


Up to this moment I'd only had a very slight gastric upset (like a hint of indigestion without anything major). Now, lying on my back, waves of nausea came. After 30mins of the tape I get up and the nausea subsides.


7:00pm I now have about an hour left before my friend comes to pick me up to go to a gig. Hmm... I knew about this and had expecte to be post peak... and I am. 

I realise that I'm out of skins (rolling papers) and go to buy some at the petrol station. A bit weord, all that, but not realyl a problem. Done before I'd even fulyl experienced the transaction and on the way home. The moon is fairly full and looks simply amazing.  Time to roll a couple of doobs for later, then heat up some soup so I have something in the stomach before the beer drinking at the gig . . . needless to say, the music was nothing short of amazing. I was realy there and thought nothing except what i heard.


Oh, and digestion turned out just fine... including quite a few beers spread out over the night between 8:30pm and 1:30am. The spliffs made me feel VERY nice, zero paranoia. This, for me, is not always the case, so I'm very positively surprised.  Next day = NO hangover whatsoever. Invited at friends for brunch. Had a great time, nice weather, and full of genuine appreciation for being with my friends and being alive. I often get this post-trip clarity and appreciation, but this time it was very mild and very light and very truly enjoyable. Nothing deep, just something very natural.


I will defnitely use this compound again soon, possibly in conjunction with nitrous + mushrooms.


I am naturally a little moody and have slightly bipolar tendencies, and for this reason many PSYs send me to the "dark side" for some of the time as well. This time, I certainly did see it (it is always there), but the material made it very easy for me to remember love and self-acceptance and gratefulness. It may have just been me, but I feel that the DIPT suggested this to me to some extent. It seemed to make it easy for me to go that way.


Perhaps not many people will get these effects from a mere 22mg, but then I am very sensitive to many substances. You may say my "insanity threshold" is fairly low, or perhaps that I am a lightweight, or that I am blessed with very sensitive receptors ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


DIPT is so much more than just auditory fun (effects which last well into the next day indeed, even after everythign else is back to baseline, along with a subtle euphoria), and if I had known how much I would like it I think Iwould have gotten my hands on more when it was still easily obtained.


Peace Love Light

you think some k would go well with this? k really blows up most psychedelic experiences into absolute madness. K alone gives weird audio distortions, and could possibly really bring out any visuals dipt might have, since dipt seems like it lacks alot of visuals.


also, Do you think its a great drug to use for musicians? to gain ideas? write some really fucking trippy music?

DiPT remains one of the weirdest but most profound experiences I've had.  I tried it at 50mg.  The link to my report is here:


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47042](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47042)


I can't even describe how weird this substance is.  I can't wait to try it again, except I'll make sure to be outside when I do.  As strange as it makes music sound, its true profundity lies in what you can hear in nature.


I feel like DiPT blocks off a certain portion of your hearing, confirmed to me by a strange pressure in the back of the ears that it causes, sort of like when you're yawning.  My theory is that it blocks a lot of the regular sound waves that we hear from reaching our eardrums, but because of this, we become sensitive to a huge variety of overtones and other sounds that are normally below our notice.  it also seems to make me VERY sensitive to noise, as though I can hear vast distances.  High-pitched noises seem relatively unaltered except with a wire-tension twang added to them, such as birds chirping or tire friction on the highway.  Low-pitched noises seem to flange and appears to be vastly lower and hollow, and give me the impression of a bottomless depth.  But strangely, middle-range noises like the sound of a car passing by are almost impossible to hear.  Also, being outside, I could hear some sort of deep, vibrational communication coming from somewhere vastly far away, almost like cosmic whale-calls.  All this weirdness combined with a very active tryptamine mindfuck combines to create one powerful experience, but it's all about your setting.


At a lower dosage, sounds just become deeper.  At a higher dosage like the one I took, they no longer sound in tune with each other, and everything begins to sound metallic, especially male human voices.


Just read the report.  it explains it better than I could here.


I'm not sure I'd want to combine a dissociative with it, and I definitely wouldn't want to write music on it.  Music sounds wrong and frankly kind of creepy and unenjoyable on DiPT, at least at 50mg, in my opinion.  Listening to the background noises of existence was much more fulfilling.  DiPT gave me a greater understanding on the structure of sound, I think, but it's not great for regular music.  Experimental sound-based music, perhaps.


A final note:  lately I've become pretty good at tripping around people who don't know I'm tripping and acting fairly normal.  DiPT is not something I'd ever want to try this with.  Its effect on sound is so bizarre that ordinary communication is impossible.  Never underestimate your sense of hearing to shape your perception of reality.


EDIT:  Re-reading my own report above, I must say I no longer agree with everything I wrote.  It happened about a year ago.  But for the most part it communicates the experience well.

Anyone tried this plugged?  I've got 100mg but with 50mg to get a full experience for me, I'd like to be able to conserve.


Also, has anyone tried combining it with a highly visual tryptamine?  I'll bet THAT would be insane.  or perhaps a phenethylamine.

Quoting an old, old post... just because I think this is totally, totally true.  Nature is never completely silent, and DiPT gives a new meaning to the heartbeat of the world.  Music only distracts and annoys, and prevents the truly psychedelic effects from manifesting.

I completely agree.  It has been over three years since my DiPT experience (my how time flies) but I am still in utter awe of it.  My jaw also still drops when I read the entries in TIHKAL which suggest there is nothing entheogenic to DiPT...that it simply alters the sense of hearing.  But because of the nature of my experience, I know in my heart that I would not have had such a powerful entheogenic experience if I had been anywhere but where I was (in nature, next to a creek.)  I am sure I have provided the link to my DiPT experience earlier in the thread...but just in case I didn't....


[http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24311](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24311)


Incidently, the friend I was with who experienced none of the entheogenic effects I did ended up taking DiPT again a few weeks later...but he upped his dosage to 100mg.  He took it while camping in the mountains in the wilderness.  This time, he had the full experience and also experienced entities and the connection to other demensions.


In the right setting, DiPT is truely one of the most powerful and remarkable psychedelics there is.  I don't often list it as one of the best....but it really is one of the best psychedelics I have ever done.  And no unwanted extras such as bodyload or nausea.

I insufflated 40mg a little while before taking some AMT (60mg, I think.. its been a while).


The whole incident was increadibly bizarre. My girlfriend, who is very small and unmistakeably feminine sounding... sounded like one of my larger male friends. When she was talking, walking down the hall, I thought it was him until I saw her. This caught me off guard.


Then when I actually heard him talk, he sounded like a very large, heavy set deep-voiced gangsta rapper.


Then our neighbor came over to see if we could find him a sack of weed. ( At least, thats what I was told.) This guy was an pretty obese wanna-be gangsta type, with a thunderous voice. I couldn't understand anything the man was saying. All I heard was a deep, booming "ribbit! ribbit! ribbit! smoooookina bluuuuuunt...". He sounded like a gigantic toad. I laughed until I was cramped up an hurting. This was the first of two incidents when he came over to ask about finding a sack and I was fried and reacted oddly. I'm sure he thinks I'm nuts, and glad I moved out.


A little while after that, the AMT is kicking in pretty hard. Instead of the DiPT wearing off, it increases in effect. There was some Tool song playing on the stereo, but all I could hear was a horrific screeching. Everyone's voice sounded like a fight between two cheese graters. It was scary as fuck, and kept getting more and more intense.


Then, pretty much out of nowhere, it mellowed out and the AMT took over.

Yeah, try DiPT while listening to Grace Slick!  First thing I did when I got home (this is after my peak) was put on the Jefferson Airplane.  The song “She Has Funny Cars.”  Drums start off the song, they sound normal.  Then guitar comes in, and it is completely out of tune.  Then vocals come on, and my jaw drops.  Next song is “White Rabbit” and instead of Grace Slick, I hear this deep man’s voice singing.  Unforgettable.  But yeah, to get the most from DiPT one needs to be (in my belief) outside, in a quite area, at night.  There is a dimension DiPT accesses, but there is no way for one to be aware of it when music, or people, are present to interrupt and disrupt the gateway to this place.

I think I must use DIPT again soon too. probably in conjunction with another triptamine indeed. My two previous trials have been intriguing and rewarding but it has been mainly the acoustic shift which persists well into the next day with me that has kept me from doing it again - it does get somewhat annoying at teh end of the trip, and then when it's still there the next day even though everything else is baseline, it really isn't that much fun.

DiPT sounds intresting to me for the auditory effects. That sounds like a very odd effect that nothing else can give. I may have to get a small amount of it and try it out ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I surely wouldn't be looking for a +4 experience though.

^^ Nevertheless, it can and has happened.  Personally I'm one of the (evidently) minority who believes this drug is capable of extremely strong psychedelic experiences.  I know MGS agrees with me, however.

I don't 'believe' this drug us capable of producing memorable entheogenic experiences....I know it is.  And the key to ensuring it is to take DiPT at night, while outiside in complete silence.  Other than myself, and a good friend who took my advice...I've yet to read of another DiPT user who took it in the same setting as I.


Just like divinorum.....entheogenic experiences with DiPT are elusive.  Set and setting are key if you are looking for more than just an altered sense of hearing.

 i couldent understand what plp had to say for almost the whole day  well after the trip ended.but  there was no negative side effects. i got some minor hallucinations. it was very cool. alls i could was stand in the same place i couldent really move because i was so over taken buy the music.plan to do some over halloween weekend. i will be trying 225 to see how i react before i go. i like this  substance because the toxitcy for this is very low.i would like to turn it into freebase to see what the effects would be ive  heard a little about it. they say you  get  pretty sweet hallucinations.I aslo have a very high tolerence to tryptamines it seems to never go away much even after  long breaks.

this is just my 2 cents on DiPT..


I took aprox 20 to 25mg and sprinkled it on a bowl of weed. I toked it back till there was nothing left. The smoke tasted horrable.


I think I was more fucked than I thought. I lost my pipe somewhere outside where I was smoking..


I put on some Gwar and all their songs sounded like they were at a lower pitch than what they should have been.


Sometimes it sounded like they had a wammie bar in the guitars, but I knew there was no wammy in any of their songs.


I definately want to try this again.. but with an oral dose

Definitely try an oral dose.  I found 50mg to be very profound and one of my best trips.  I then took 50mg again a little less than a week later and although the sound alteration was just as intense (and both times the sound was MUCH, MUCH more altered than sounding slightly dropped in pitch), this time the mental effects were almost nothing, whereas the first time the mental effects were the most prominent part.


I would recommend a 50mg dose for your first oral dose - it's intense, but very manageable.  Next time I try it I'm going to go for 75mg orally, personally.  And also, make sure to take it outside.  Listening to music gets old quick, but its real magic lies in going outside and listening to the world hum, and beings trying to communicate through sound from some vast distance, sort of like massive outer space whales.  At least that's the impression I got.  Also of note is that the mental effects I got were vastly enhanced once I went outside.

i insnuffated 33 mg this evening. first i had a pretty auditory trip (music improved, voices distorted) with minor head trip and CEV/OEV. later on, i smoked some cannabis, which changed this in a full-blown "tryp" a la Psilocybin or LSD with impressive colorful optics. and nitrous oxide could boost that even further. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


whole duration: 7-8 hours. i'm on 200 mg Venlafaxine (SNRI antidepressant medication) daily, btw.

How long until the psychedelic effects were noted?  For me the onset of DiPT was almost MDMA-like (not euphoric so much, but definitely empatheogenic) with auditory distortions.  However at 2hr it was completely psychedelic and even out-of-body...this with 70mg orally.

the auditory effects took pretty long to appear, something between one and two hours. it seems like the nasal application did not speed the onset up, as i had hoped. that's also why i consumed the total amount in several small portions over half an hour.


i didn't experience any effects which i would describe as empathogen or entactogen, but on the other hand i have no experience with MDMA or similar drugs. but maybe also my antidepressant killed a possible MDMA-like effect?

The antidepressant undoubtedly changed the experience for you in some way, anyway.  Hard to say how, though.


For me, the progression of DiPT's effects went something like this:


T+0:20 - Theshold effects begin, some body and stomach weirdness.


T+0:40 - Sounds begin to drop slightly in pitch


T+1:00 - Body begins to level out and feel quite good, sounds all of a sudden become almost unrecognizable.  One moment the pitch was just lower, and the next I felt like I was on an alien planet.


T+1:30 - The mental effects begin


T+2:15 - Mental effects peak.  This has become extremely psychedelic


Then it tapered off starting at about 4.5 hours.  mental effects were gone at 5-6 hours, but sound did not fully return until somewhere around 20 hours, in fact the next afternoon.


Wow, it's been a while.  I need to try my 75mg outdoor dose of this soon!

Ditto.  DiPT was so amazing.  It is so easy to overlook those more subtle properties in the wrong setting.  I took DiPT outdoors and had a +4 experience complete with entity contact,  Amazing substance...among my favorite tryptamines...even after only one try.  Stocked up bigtime with this one.  I think it is even more amazing than DPT.  DPT was mystical, but much harder to bare.  DiPT was gentle but every bit as profound.  Man, I bet both together would be amazing.  Oh wow, Iwill have to do that one day.  I'd probably take both orally even though I usually IM DPT.  Or smoke DPT base at the peak.  No, both orally.  75mg of each.  That would be so intense.

Hmm, this shit scared the crap out of me tonight. I sampled 75mg for the first time- too alien. I was absoutely terrified; bad set and setting etc. but what is going on here?? I 'expected' pitch fluctuations, but not genuine 'robotification' of peoples voices and certainly not the extreme distortion of ambient noises. Interesting was when I freaked out a bit and went to the bathroom; the reverberation of pretty much nothing was loud as all hell, but seemed to only shift by a pitch. 


I didn't feel much of a body sensation, slightly DMT-like bending and twisting sensations with eyes closed; no real visuas, except a general haze of 'difference' to the landscape, and some migraine-y like blobs. I now have a killah headache and ringing in my ears, and fuck it if it isn't D7....


This stuff is weirded then I could have imagined. I am very unsure whether I will try it again, though I think I might smoke a little bit, fwiw. I just can't see any point in going for it again.


Fuck. I'm reeling here; that was too normal and weird if that makes sense. I am about to consume some LSD so I hope that the ringing stops....![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

These are all very high doses, I think.


All my experiences with this substances were profound and I don't remember ever going above 25mg rectally.


Not sure if I mentioned this in this thread, but I found its synergy with DPT to be matched only by the synergy between Heroin and Cocaine in a speedball.


Definitely one of my favourite drugs, and *the* best one with "DiPT" in its name for sure.

^Hmm, I'd guaged 75mg to be a decent; not too high dose. I believe orally it goes up to 250mg in TiHKAL.... rectal of course will be stronger.


I don't know, it was lamost like I am too sober to ignore the DiPT weirdness or accept it at least. Damn ear ringing.....

Apparently at higher doses the sound distortion becomes annoying and the psychedelic effects don't really increase. This could be the reason...?


And for some reason, the audio effects last faaaar longer than the drug itself. Does anyone think this may suggest that these effects are due to a more peripheral action of DiPT?

yeah, jamshyd, thats what I've always though. I would love to see a study looking at DiPT and the inner ear. I wonder if its something going on there. Too lazy right now to grab my neurosci book but there is something about pitch being scaled (sort of like the analogue to retinotopy in V1) by mechanical means.

^If the inner ear was directly involved, wouldn't balance also be effected? I felt a bit dizzy etc. but feel fine now; except my hearing is still wonky. 


I dunno; i think it more effects nearual processing; as if a few hZ are shaved off or addded to each sound in a non-harmonoius way. I believe I will sample a lower dose again; I do sound engineering and by gods if I didn't have the worlds greatest FX Unit in my ehad last night! I also think there is 'delay' added to sounds; I noticed that sharp silibant sound, like T  or Ssss had a very very loud pre-delay sound to it. I might do some recordings today to see if I can emulate what I mean by that and post them up here.

The auditory and vestibular system are ultimately separate mechanisms, so it would depend at what level of the 'inner ear' you're talking about.

^That said, I find that most tryptamines, 5-Meo-DMT escpecially gives me major "motion sickness" if I move around too much; likeweise but to a lesser extent with DMT. So it would appear that the inner-ear is being effected there, I guess what you'd call the vestibular system- vertigo or the contrast of visual uptake and visual input- whereas DiPT can do that, but seems to focus on audio phenomen. That probably made no sense, kinda speculating aloud.

Well they are two questions: a) whether both the vestibular and auditory system are affected by psychedelics (and I think most would say yes they are according to something close to your personal experience) and b) whether the mechanism of action that creates the auditory downshifts and hallucinations in DiPT also affects the vestibular system (and I think most are out to lunch when you ask them that question, since the right research has just not been done yet).

Jamshyd, if your dosages are rectal...then they don't really relate to oral dosing.  With oral levels, psychedelic effects don't really begin for most until 50-75mg.


swilow, set and setting man!!  Try again outdoors in a peaceful setting...this one blessed me with a +4.  I can too see how it would be terrifying in the wrong area.  I also know what you mean by alien...but I don't think its anymore so than DPT or DMT.

I know, I know....twas a bad timing, I was planning on taking my share home; kinda wasn't kosher at that stage, so I just downed it with a beer. I actually found that the sounds of nature frighened/alarmed me the most; I really found it quite difficult to 'place' myself in an environment. I think because I've been playing/making music for so long I may have sensitised my hearing somewhat.... 


But if I get a chance to consume again, it will be a lower dose, 40-50mg, and I think having eyes shut the whole time and sitting on a grassy knoll in the bush listening to birds alien tweeting. But I think EYES SHUT could be essential; I have a feeling that more visual aspects will become noticeable if I restrict my brain from external sources and allow the pitch effects to maybe create some synaethesia. One thing to any who consume this in the future; if you have a didjeridoo or recordsing of one, play/check them out. That was by far the best 'sound' of the experience.


Personally, I will specualte that the pitch shifting is perceptual; maybe a more circituous route is taken by audio signals resulting in an increase or decrease in the cycles (sample rate) of the sound source. Most pitch shifters, which can drop pitch and retain the correct timing information do so by removing portions of the audio, or to raise pitch the fundamental frequency remains intact and the harmonics are shifted upwards. I didn't feel that DiPT effects much beyond the region where humans hearing is at its finest; 1-4khZ; the vocal range. That said, we get so much information from the region, distoring it changes everything really. 


I wonder what it would be like to consume in an anechoic chamber; a room for testing specilaist audio and other equipment that has no reflection or reverberation; the effect of entering such a room almost makes one fall to the floor; very hard to orient oneself. Interestingly, carbamazepine lowers pitch by one semi-tone; recent article in New Scientist in regards to that. I am going to write in mentioning the effect of DiPT- I already wrote to Dr Oliver Sacks, but I didn't get a reply. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I can completely imagine where you are coming from.  My time with DiPT, I was outside, in compete darkness, and next to a stream.  So hearing played little-to-no role in my DiPT peak experience.  I was not listening to music, and there was little sound (except for that of nature.)


As soon as I got home, I felt mostly down until I turned on the stereo and listened to Grace Slick (who sounded like a man), and I was amazed/freaked out/in shock at how foreign the very familiar recording sounded.  And this was after the peak.  The shock!!!!


I could see how that would be unnerving.


DiPT should be consumed in total darkness and silence as far as I am concerned.  The audio distortions are just a distraction/amusing side effect.  Once you are in a circumstance where the senses are not tickled, I think the psychedelic side of DiPT will shine.

I've taken DiPT on about 12 occasions, with doses ranging from 60 mg to 100 mg oral. This is a retrospective summary mainly of the auditory effects as I experienced them.


I'll outline here the auditory effects, in the order in which they arrived. This order of events was the same across all my experiences with DiPT. All that varied for me, with dose and stomach contents, are the speed of the trajectory and how far down the list I get before plateauing.


(ETA: I'm not implying these are distinct stages; rather the experience passes smoothly between the 'stages', with part-semitone shifts noticeable if one attends carefully. But this gives an idea of when the other effects happen relative to the pitch-shift...)


1. One semitone lowering in perceived pitch, and low-pass filtering (the low-pass filtering makes voices in particular seem considerably lower than the actual pitch shifting would imply).


2. Two semitone lowering in perceived pitch, and partial inharmonicity (spectrum stretching) makes piano bell-like and voices robot-like, and consonant chords weirdly dissonant. (Alternatively, this could equally be ring modulation.)


3. Three semitone lowering in perceived pitch and inharmonicity is complete: with the whole spectrum stretched, normally consonant chords are now weirdly consonant.


4a. In nonsilence: nonlinear distortion of pitch and timbre, very hard to pin down the nature of the effects; 


4b. In silence: closed-ear audials, such as high-pitched ringing, lower-pitched 80s synth chord sequences, and general squelching and blooping. 


60 mg peaked at Phase 2, 70 mg at Phase 3, and 100 mg at Phase 4. Intervening doses between 70 and 100 mg  touched on Phase 4 more or less briefly.


Phase 2 was generally accompanied by some coming-up jitters (?motor psychedelia?), but a fairly pleasant bodyfeel generally persisted throughout the experiences, including during the jitters. 


Phase 4 was always (when reached) accompanied by a leap in cognitive psychedelic effects. An intense awareness of sensory-motor feedback in any movement I made (if I moved my arm slightly, it caused a movement in my shirt, which in turn vibrated molecules which vibrated bits of my ear which triggered signals in the auditory cortex) haunted many of these phases for me. There was always, as one might expect I guess, given my mainly auditorily motivated interest in DiPT - a strongly auditory flavour to my lines of thought on DiPT.


At the highest doses, Phase 4 was also accompanied by mild visual effects, mostly brightness and flashing white light, and general shiftiness and movement. 


Phase 4 rarely allowed me to listen to music for long. With such a distorted and enhanced auditory scene, silence seems golden. And then ceases to be silence at all, but hey! :D


I hope soonish to investigate various aspects of DiPT's effects on my auditory perception in a series of psychophysical tests on myself: the above is all based on my subjective impressions, my qualia... these tests will provide more rigorous assessment of my perceptions. In the first stage of this, I hope to model quantitatively the pitch shifts at a range of doses and at various points in the frequency spectrum. But I also hope to model the timbral effects (which may  be mediated by inharmonic spectrum stretching or some kind of ring modulation, or something else entirely), by examining perceived consonance and dissonance of various combinations of tones. I'll post results here when I have them.


ETA: Oh, I should add, for this retrospective summary, that I tried DiPT 70 mg oral in combination with 2C-E 18 mg oral once. I'll have to repeat this or similar to have a clearer idea of it, but I believe the two substances fused quite interestingly, for a while, with the 2C-E seeming to bring out visual elements of DiPT (or perhaps DiPT bringing out tryptaminesque elements of 2C-E: either way, I was experiencing visual effects that felt tryptamine in origin or influence). Due to differences in duration of peak effects, I guess, 2C-E came to dominate after a while.

What's listening to music like on DiPT? Annoying, or painful to hear?

I find that, before everything gets really chaotic (at peak of 85 mg+ say), some music is wonderful on DiPT: beyond that, the only good music is no music. (Oh, and the no-music is pretty damn good. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) There is typical psychedelic music-enhancement for me, as well as the distortion. And some things do actually sound great when DiPT-shifted. But I think it would be very hard to predict, on the basis of what music you like now, what music you'd enjoy listening to while on DiPT. A familiar piece of music may become unlistenable, or may be transformed into a barely-recognizable but brilliant remix of itself. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I've not yet worked out what factors influence how well a piece of music translates into DiPT-space.


ETA: To compare that to visual effects: What's looking at paintings like on LSD? Sometimes wonderful, sometimes very offputting. Depends, in fairly complex ways probably, on the painting and on your tastes. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


At high peaks, music does become too difficult for me to listen to. Like staring into a load of bright light sources while tripping on a more visual psychedelic, perhaps.

Yeah, I found it incredibly interesting from a music standpoint (figuring out how all the different pitches changes, etc), but the baselines sound way off from the rest of the music.  For me, it was like the bass was in tune with it's self, but in a different key than the vocals.  The middle range instruments were in tune with themselves, but in a different key than everything else and so on.


This kind of thing is very interesting to me, but for the most part sounds bad.  I had some music enhancement, but it sounded worse than usual, so it all equaled out.  I also noticed at higher doses high pitches almost split into higher and lower overtones that echo of the surroundings.  Very weird effects.


So, interesting, yes.  Musically inspiring, no.  Definitely worth trying at least once though.

Invert, great post... that describes DipT very well.  I've tried it at 50mg twice and briefly reached "phase 4".  I found it most amazing to be outdoors and listen to the world... sound was perceived inamazing ways and you can tell how highly directional it is.  Cars driving on a nearby road made high-pitched wire-tension sounds but their lower-pitched normal sound was blocked... when stepping around a corner the sound stopped entirely, and when stepping back out I could feel, almost see it slam back into me.  I also seemed to be able to hear something unbelievably massive from unbelievably far away making communication sounds... I interpreted it as faraway stars or planets.


I found music interesting to listen to for a few minutes, but then it got too chaotic... it's definitely not pleasurable to listen to music, just interesting.  Going outside and being in "silence" is much better.


Anyone else noticed the inner ear movement on DiPT?  It feels like something physically closes or moves and blocks out a certain range of sound we normally hear... complete with the heavy tinnitus (ear ringing), it really kind of feels like it makes me deaf to the usual range of sounds but because those sounds are gone I can hear much more clearly other ranges of sound... overtones maybe that are normally blocked.  It feels like I'm deaf to some sounds but like I can hear the rest unbelievably clearly.


Man, that reminds me of my experiences.  I'll have to use DiPT again soon, especially now that I live in the mountains.  The mountains are crazy to listen to without hearing modulation. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

TRULY one of the most haunting experiences of my life was listening to daniel johnston and joanna newsome on DiPT and having them sound normal for the first time, listening to walking the cow by daniel johnston brought tears to my eyes.

Thanks, yes, I should take DiPT outdoors (both in nature and in city, I imagine), and I'll certainly do that at some point. Your experiences of it sound quite fascinating. But I do still adore its effects on music pre-Phase 4 (especially when I'm making the music myself, on the piano) to such an extent that I'd be reluctant to be too far from my piano and stereo on most DiPT trips. 


I'm not sure about inner ear movement, but I was aware sometimes of dampening of parts of the spectrum (other than the early low-pass) that are normally quite acute. But I've not really examined that experience very carefully.

LOL, one of my more haunting DiPT-related experiences was hearing Tony Blair (then PM of Britain) sounding sincere (ETA: This was during the Phase 1 low-pass filtering - otherwise he'd probably have sounded more like a robot alien overlord with a malfunctioning translator ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)). Something about the deeper timbre just made him sound so much more pleasant and trustworthy. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif) ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) But yes, some music does suit the DiPT transform, in my view...


 To take a simple example: a single piano note at Phase 2 or 3 can be an exquisite bell-like sound of rich complexity. A slight appoggiatura develops in later Phases. This pretty, ornamented tone can, if given the time and frequency-space to do its thing, form part of a lovely and strange and DiPTich piece of music (that might well sound crap when not on DiPT). Some normal music - by chance -  approximates the sort of music that one might write on DiPT. Much of it (perhaps because of excessive tempo, or certain types of harmony, timbre, or sound quality) doesn't.

Here is my experience report on Erowid about DiPT, the experience I mentioned in my post.  In case you'd like to read about it further.  I of course went into far more detail in mky report.

Ah yes, I read that report before I first took DiPT. I've read it again now, and it's a great read, very interesting. I'd forgot about the sounds slowing down thing (except for the appoggiatura on the piano, which I'd forgotten was related to this). Could I check we mean the same thing by this? Do you mean that each unit of sound (say a syllable of speech or a note or chord in music) sounds as though it's in the process of slowing down (reducing in pitch as well) but without that slowing down passing on to the next unit, so that it always sounds in the process of slowing without ever actually doing it? 


I've noticed this in speech and in piano (essentially a descending appoggiatura of about 1 or 2 semitones, iirc, in the latter case). I can't recall  which phase of overall frequency-shift it accompanied. 


One guess I have of what's happening here is that differences in the frequency spectrum between the attack and sustain phases of a tone, combined with a degree of nonlinearity in the frequency shift across different parts of the spectrum, is producing a frequency shift within each note (and a frequency shift may not be easily distinguishable from a slowing down, since the latter would produce the former, and - on the level of a single note or syllable - tempo would be hard to assess). Does that seem at all possible?


ETA: This guess could easily be tested, I think: If it's right, we should find no such effect with pure sine tones.

Yes, that is exactly what I mean. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Your theory sounds perfectly plausible.  It makes sense.

Well I know 30mg orally was well above threshold for me, reaching invert's level two.  I'd imagine IM would be at least equivalent to that, and probably more intense.

Don't know if you missed my edit to an earlier post where I mention DiPT+2C-E... they synergized nicely for quite a while (playing the piano was a gloriously strange experience: the piano keys looked and felt as weird as they sounded), but the duration of the peak effects of 18 mg oral 2C-E outlived the peak effects of 70 mg oral DiPT and thus overwhelmed them at later points in the trip, such that the DiPT effects were on their own, and not of much interest.


ETA: Damn, this talk of frogs ribbitting reminds me that I really must take DiPT in nature some time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Most of my opportunities to trip are at night, which makes it more tricky.

i have combined DiPT with DPT, and the synergy was indeed magnificent. probably the most visual thing i have ever experience open-eye, outside of a DMT flash. EVERYTHING was rapidly growing and shrinking and a black hole of rainbow lattice work opened up in the sky and began to pull me off the ground.![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)


in essence DiPT is the reason i love psychedelics, its THE gateway into absurdity.

Actually I haven't tied DiPT at night but I feel like daytime would definitely be preferrable.  Seems like a daytime drug for me.  Then again, day and night have a whole different collection of sounds so both would undoubtedly be worthwhile as long as time was spent outdoors. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yes, I remember once sitting by a frog pond on a low dose of DPT. The frogs were very forceful with me in disinhabiting my ego shell and emerging to become part of them.

once i did DiPT during the day and once at night, as might be expected the day was glorious and majestic, and the night was mysterious and eerie, well both were both those things but you get the idea...

It feels like something physically closes or moves and blocks out a certain range of sound we normally hear... complete with the heavy tinnitus (ear ringing), it really kind of feels like it makes me deaf to the usual range of sounds but because those sounds are gone I can hear much more clearly other ranges of sound... overtones maybe that are normally blocked.  It feels like I'm deaf to some sounds but like I can hear the rest unbelievably clearly.

70 mg made me feel like being contused. Tinnitus was next to painful and persisted 14 hours until I went to sleep, long after most of all the other effects were gone, and disappeared completely only the next morning. Ear inflammation feels almost identical. It is absent at lower doses, like 30 mg, where other auditory effects are already noticeable.

**DiPT experiments...**


I've made a new version of the testing program, with the sound sorted out now (it had crackles in the previous version): [http://diptology.pbwiki.com/f/DiPTtest0_1.zip](http://diptology.pbwiki.com/f/DiPTtest0_1.zip)


This is a program designed to test people's pitch perception, and attempt to train them, to see if their pitch perception can be improved. It will take about 5 minutes (or more, depending on how you do), but you'd be welcome to quit the program when you get bored, and send me the incomplete data. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


This program is **not to be run while under the influence of DiPT**... It is just a pilot study to see if people can do the task okay normally: I need to know whether they can before I distribute the first proper DiPT experiment. So you don't need to be a DiPT-user to help out with this: you just need to have vaguely normal hearing and a desire to help further our understanding of this remarkable psychedelic, and/or of the parts of our auditory system that it affects.


You also **don't need to have perfect pitch**. I don't have perfect pitch, but I can do the task (not perfectly, but well enough). It might help to have some experience of playing music, but it may not be necessary. Anyone with normal hearing can attempt this task. 


If anyone's willing to help with this, please download the zip file, extract it, then run the program within it, then send the output file to diptology (at) safe-mail.net (or PM me its contents). (Out of interest, let me know when you send the output - if you don't mind - what sort of experience of music you have, e.g. listening, playing, studying, etc.)


Please let me know if there are any problems in running this program, or any bugs. In anticipation, many thanks.


(The results of this pilot study, and of future experiments, will be documented at [diptology.pbwiki.com](http://diptology.pbwiki.com).)

Iv heard that it takes away from the annoying audio effects and brings out the more psychedelic nature of the chemical.

Do you mean same onset time and peak and comedown, or just same balance of cognitive and auditory effects? It would be useful to me, much as I dislike a rapid come-up as a rule, to be able to take DiPT with a more rapidly reached and passed peak. (It's often only at night, not long after a meal, that I get the opportunity.)

Ah, shame. I could do with a faster-in and faster-out roa (in relation to the cognitive and physical effects, that is: I can sleep with auditory distortion, but not with psychedelic stimulation). I don't think anyone's commented on the duration of rectal DiPT in this thread? Does anyone have experience of this? Or IV or IM? (Though, really, I'm not sure I fancy using needles: I fear my hands aren't steady enough for this sort of method; wouldn't mind rectal, I think, though I've not tried that method before.)


ETA: I suppose benzos would be an alternative... but I have addictive tendencies, and would rather not have benzos available to me. Are there any trip-killers that aren't so liable to addiction? I guess some anti-psychotics, maybe?


But then again, it's more the long come-up that I want to get rid of, for convenience, since I have a relatively narrow window of normal waking hours where I can take it, as a rule. If I could just shift the main part of the trip so that it starts and ends a couple of hours earlier, that'd be nice.

I've tried DiPT rectally before; however, it was only 10mg during a time when I was using a lot of psychedelics (and thus, I had a lot of tolerance).  Nevertheless, it worked... I felt a bit of the body buzz and low sounds dropped one or two pitches, while mid to high sounds stayed relatively untouched.  No mental effects were detected other than a lightening of mood, which was probably just the result of not feeling bored (which was why I was taking so many in the first place).  If I recall correctly, the sound effects still lasted significantly longer than the physical effects, but they did not last as long as I would have expected from an equivalent oral dose.  But all in all, the dose was too low and the circumstances not good enough to really conclude anything.

I'd like to add that at 50mg, the peak was relatively intense cognitively, the plateau lasted for 14 hours, and I sit here now--38 hours later--still hearing the auditory effects and slight tinnitus.

^ Thanky, linky worky now.


I'll run it in a few days after the effects of the drug have completely worn off. It's been 53 hours and I'm still hearing slight pitch anomalies...


I'm also going to run some tests at my recording studio using sine waves and pink/white/brown noise. An engineer friend and myself will dose at 25mg and determine how many Hz we have to bring up various frequencies to make them sound "normal." Probably going to use 100Hz, 1kHz, and 8kHz, as well as pink and white noise. Not a major study, but just to have an amateur idea.


My theory at this point is that DIPT nonlinearly affects the timing of impulses along Cranial Nerve VIII. We'll compare notes when we're both done, and maybe some of our findings could be useful in your research. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for that info. I'm guessing there's some increase in potency relative to oral, then? I've never taken 10mg oral, but I'd be surprised if that produced a two semitone lowering. Did the auditory effects start and peak much earlier than orally?

Well I took it at 3PM on Friday, empty stomach, and the peak came about T+3:00. Surprisingly, I had a big dinner at T+4:00, which went down fine, and plateau-ed (i.e., the cognitive effects were maintained) for the next 10 hours, during which I suffered some minor GI symptoms (gas, runs) that may or may not have been caused by the drug. I finally fell asleep around T+15:00.


On Saturday, I woke up at T+24:00 with some slight tinnitus and significant pitch alterations, but the cognitive effects were gone.


It's now T+53:30, and slight pitch effects linger, but no tinnitus.

Thanks, that's interesting... Is it possible that the big dinner slowed down the plateau and come-down, or would stomach contents be irrelevant by that stage in the trip? (I know woefully little about the biological and chemical side of how we process such substances.)

**DiPT + Methylone?**


Has anyone tried DiPT combined with Methylone? Or indeed with MDMA? I notice one post describing a DiPT+MDMA in this thread, in addition to a DiPT+Methylone report at erowid, and Shulgin's report of MDMA+DiPT. From the erowid report with Methylone, it comes not recommended due to body load, but the report doesn't seem to give any detail as to the nature or timing of the bodily issues. 


I am contemplating the following combination, to be taken on a stomach that has had a light snack five hours previously:


t+0.00 100 mg DiPT

t+4.00 (or adjust time for whenever the peak cognitive effects have passed, but still in a psychedelic mental state) 80 mg Methylone

t+4.30 If I do not feel uncomfortably stimulated or auditorily in pain, or in any other way problematic, another 80 mg Methylone

t+5.00 Again, this is an optional step, that I might well omit depending on how I feel: 20 mg 2C-B.


Any thoughts on this? I've combined similarly low dose Methylone with low dose 4-Aco-DMT (with a similar timing: Methylone immediately following peak) before to very pleasant effect; and moderate DiPT with fairly high dose 2C-E, which synergized nicely while they overlapped. And I'm thinking, since I never get uncomfortably stimulated or jittery on DiPT after the cognitive peak, and since I'm planning to space out relatively low doses of Methylone, this shouldn't be too troubling.


I should perhaps try Methylone-->2C-B separately before going for the three-way combination. That would probably be sensible, since I've never combined a 2C-x with Methylone (although I have with low dose MDMA).


ETA: Also, would the Methylone or 2C-B chasers be likely to extend the duration of DiPT's auditory effects?

Okay, I did just steps one and two of that planned combination (98 mg DiPT, followed by 80 mg Methylone at t+5.00 hours). The Methylone was rather later than I originally planned (I was cognitively at baseline, and auditorily in phase 2 or 3 (the interesting closed-ear audials had faded to mild high-pitched noise, but perceived nonlinear pitchshift, of on average 2 or 3 semitones, was present)). I don't think the Methylone influenced the remaining DiPT effects at all, when taken in this order: there seemed to be no reincreasing of auditory or cognitive effects in its wake.


 It's hard to say if there was any interaction in the other direction, of DiPT moderating the effect of Methylone, because I've not previously taken 80 mg Methylone (a jolly low dose) on a stomach that's had virtually no food in it in the past 10 hours. Anyway, the effects of the Methylone dose were notcieable (whether they be main effects or an interaction), and had a timecourse comparable to what I'm used to at a range of doses: t+20-50mins - warm euphoric empathogenic come-up; t+60mins onwards: jaw clenching and stimulation; but these were very much milder than I'd expect from a larger dose of Methylone, of course, and I could sleep from three hours after the dose (never possible for me at higher doses until at least six hours).


So it looks like DiPT and Methylone with this dosing regime have not much interaction; the one just overlayed the other. 


I collected a fair amount of data at each of three octave ranges (around 440Hz, and the two octaves below it) this time, so I'm hoping I will have data that can speak to the perceived nonlinearities of pitch shift.


I also managed to go outside! ... albeit somewhat post-peak. I'd really like to experience the peak effects outdoors (in nature, ideally), but that would - for me - entail being outside from the start of the trip, I think. Which could be quite a challenge, in various ways.


I'll put up a trip report with, I hope, more detail and the quantitative results, some time in the next week.


By the way... regarding rolling out the DiPT perception experiments to other people... I've had little response (just one person) from people trying the pilot experiment: I don't know if this is because of people not having the time (or inclination) to run the program at all (yet); or if people are put off by the task sounding difficult (and apparently depending on perfect pitch; although it really doesn't... I've had data from someone who thought they had no pitch perception at all, but they produced data that suggested they were perceiving accurately, albeit not very precisely... however, I think it probably does depend on having some knowledge of note-names and some, even if very little, experience of hearing or playing music while reading the note names). Either way, I think the best thing for me to do would be two-fold: 


1) Continue running the raw pitch perception experiment on myself, to map out in as much detail as possible the sort of stretches and shifts involved; and, once I've mapped that out, write a new program that will allow the participant to twiddle knobs that produce those stretches and shifts (with varying size and direction), and present them with a familiar piece of audio (a snippet of a song, say), distorted, and ask the to twiddle the knobs till it sounds normal again - a nulling paradigm for the nonlinear pitch shift, that should - I think - be an easier task than the absolute perception task; 


and 2) In the mean time, distribute a final version of the pitch-shift program I'm running on myself anyway, despite the lack of response to the pilot study, in case anyone does get the chance to do it while on DiPT at some point. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Oh indeed... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'm anticipating this project taking years in all (maybe decades, I don't know!). I'm sorry if I came across as impatient... I just felt (perhaps wrongly) that maybe most responses to the pilot study would have arrived by now, since it's to be run while not on DiPT. For the proper experiments, I would expect a very slow process of data collection, since there's probably not that many DiPT trips happening each year, and I'm sampling just from a subset of those where people are aware of this experiment and are inclined to donate some of their time and effort to the project.


I don't have a very clear sense of how the auditory effects of 5-MeO-DiPT compare to DiPT (I've not taken the former myself), but - if there are commonalities - perhaps some interesting data could be collected with this (more common, I think) substance.

is it something you have to do tripping?


When I trip I don't like to read instructions and do an experiment or any other stuff like that. Its splashing through creeks, rolling in mud, and burying myself in leaf piles for me.


I'll leave the experiments for the fuckin' birds.


I also honestly don't care if data about drugs like DiPT gets out to the public. I would actually rather it did not. The less people that know about these drugs, the better.

:D The pilot study is to do while not tripping, to work out whether people generally can do the pitch perception task. The experiments themselves will be to be done while tripping on DiPT (although, having said that... I will need control data for all the experiments; so people who want to help, but either don't do DiPT or don't want to experiment while tripping, can usefully provide data while not tripping). 


I find that, during the peak cognitive effects, I am entirely unwilling to do the task; but I also find that the auditory effects extend a fair way beyond the cognitive effects, so that gives me time to do the experiment (I should try to force myself, some time, though; otherwise I'll never have any data on the open-ear audials in that phase). But, unless you have creeks and leaf piles in your house, or a laptop to take with you, it could be tricky doing both in the same trip.


I can well understand that many would not wish to do an experiment while tripping. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


ETA: Of course, I'm not expecting people to spend the entire trip at their computer doing the experiment... we're talking a few minutes here and there, at times of their choosing.

If this is the concern... I don't see that conducting these experiments and reporting the data on bluelight or similar forums is likely to get DiPT scheduled anyway. This is just trip-reports, but with numbers. I'm not encouraging people who don't take DiPT to take DiPT, just asking people who do take DiPT to spend some time collecting data while they're at it; and I certainly won't be publishing findings in journals, since these experiments do not have any formal backing or institutional ethical approval: they're just products of my curiosity. 


If the quantitative data is going to get DiPT scheduled; then so is the qualitative data (i.e. normal trip reports). I really don't think that it's a bad thing to have trip reports of any kind, unless they are misleading: isn't spreading knowledge and increasing understanding generally good? And I certainly don't think numbers are more dangerous than words.

It won't affect the scheduling process at all. What you're doing is a good thing because the work won't be undertaken by by anyone but us "amateurs." Your work is the kind of thing that I'm sure Shulgin always wanted to see his "babies" associated with anyway.

The tiny number of people who take this drug are sharing information with each other on the internet. That's rather different, and I don't see how that'll promote emergency scheduling.

In the end? I don't know. But, in the mean time, they 1) promote harm reduction, by ensuring that people who do take drugs have a better idea of what they can do to minimize harm, and a better understanding of possible consequences so that they can make more informed choices; and 2) potentially provide avenues for increasing our understanding of, for example, psychedelics and their effects on human perception and cognition (whether through trip reports or more quantitative approaches). Both, I think, good things, in different ways. 


If this sort of community is likely to make it harder for us to access these substances in the long run, then that is a point against such forums' existence (although not necessarily a clinching one, in my view), but I've yet to understand why you think this sort of forum increases the likelihood of scheduling, nor why scheduling would  have any impact on our access to these substances. (As I guess you may be aware, pretty much the whole of PIHKAL and TIHKAL is scheduled in the UK: as tobala said, scheduling doesn't make things unavailable.)

I think its not unreasonable to hold a view that forums like these are masquerading as harm reduction boards, but actually are drug-promoting boards.


I've firmly made up my mind that for myself, using psychedelics is a great thing (largely only positive benefits with very few negative side effects, long or short). But, for other people...I am not so sure. A lot of people aren't capable of using psychedelics beneficially. How do I know the user 'next-door' to my on an internet forum is capable or incapable? Should I help her anyways?

Of course you should help her (I'm not telling you what to do; I'm just giving my view, since you ask). Not help her to take more drugs or take more risks, but help her to reduce risks - given that she intends to take drugs -  and to be knowledgeable. Whatever your concerns about what effect supposed harm reduction boards may really have, you as an individual can, with your experience and knowledge, share that with others to help them be well and safe. And part of your experience and knowledge is that you know other people are different, and may react differently: presumably that knowledge can also inform how you support other people. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm a little conflicted on this issue.  On one hand, it's clear that without forums such as this (and many, many others in existence), not many people would know about these kinds of drugs.  And of course the types of people who frequent these forums are enticed by reading about the drugs... I sure was.


But ultimately, I think Bluelight anyway does a lot more good than harm.  It may seem like everyone knows about these drugs now, but that's simply not true.  It just seems that way because we are the types of people who look for this kind of thing, and we're spending time communicating with others like us.  As it stands, I have met one single other person in my entire life outside of Bluelight who knew what ANY of the obscure psychedelics were or even realized they existed, and he only knew about 2C-B and 2C-I, and he had only heard hearsay about them.  I have hardly even met anyone who knows what Erowid is.  The fact (as far as I can tell) is that we are an exceedingly small percentage of the total population.  If forums like this didn't exist, we'd be an even smaller percentage, but the we're talking about a statistically insignificant population in either case.  And regardless, the word is out now among those who seek these kinds of things.


But imagine if forums like this didn't exist, especially this one which actually contains a fair amount of intelligent discussion and actual harm reduction, unlike many forums I have seen filled with a bunch of middle schoolers egging each other on to be as dangerous as possible.  Then the only information people would be likely to get would be whatever their dealer told them, the person who managed to find these things and distribute them.  And drugs are prevalent with or without drug forums, and have been for a long time.  Before the Internet, it was extremely unlikely that any given drug user actually knew a damn thing about the drug they were taking... all they "knew" was whatever their friends and acquaintences told them.


So yeah, maybe having forums like this can be enticing, and of course there are members of any forum who do not practice harm reduction.  But I think overall the benefits outweigh the negatives, and I also really do not believe that the harm reduction thing is just a front for drug promotion.  The drug promotion is a natural by-product of the fact that we're all kind of obsessed with drugs.  It's a result of drug discussion.  But within that discussion comes a lot of knowledge and with knowledge comes safety and power, if you choose to see it that way.

Invert, thanks for taking the time to respond. I mostly agree with everything you said.


Xorkoth, I like your reasoning...I think it does come down to a cost-benefit analysis...does it do more good than harm? If yes, then it should stick around.


I'll try to do your experiment though. I only have a 25mg sample of DiPT a friend gave me, but I'll do the experiment beforehand and then contemplate the results after I have tried DiPT also.

Thank you. Likewise, thanks for explaining your position. Your concerns are quite understandable, in my view; personally, I can see what you mean about the potential for harm through promoting drugs, but would agree with Xorkoth's suggestion that the good outweighs the harm.

Great, thanks! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Here's the pilot study (for running while not on DiPT) program again, as I'm not sure which page the relevant post's on: [http://diptology.pbwiki.com/f/DiPTtest0_1.zip](http://diptology.pbwiki.com/f/DiPTtest0_1.zip) 


I'll post a final version of the experimental program (geared towards being run while on DiPT, and with more user-friendly instructions, and a few improvements here and there, hopefully) some time in the next few weeks, I expect. 


But, if anyone wants to run the experiment while on DiPT before I get round to that, they could run just the first block (12 trials) of the pilot study program (before the training phase begins) and then quit the program; each time they want to run a session of it. (That's what I do when I run it on myself.) Obviously the training session would be pointless to run while on DiPT, as it would be trying to tell you what a non-DiPTified person should be hearing.

I took 120 mg DiPT oral (after peak 2C-C 10 mg insufflated was added) on a 16 hours empty stomach. Very few trip notes and no quantitative data mean I won't write a trip report, probably (although if anyone has any questions about it, I'll try to answer them here), but one aspect of DiPT's effects (prior to 2C-C insufflation) I'll note here:


During the peak of DiPT's visual effects (c. t+1.30 to t+2.30, I think), I experienced stronger visuals than I can recall experiencing on DiPT before. Still nothing completely astounding, but more than the usual flashing white lights, texture enhancement and slight waviness (all present, especially the flashing which was more extreme than I'd noted on other recent doses); specifically, there were strong visual trails (temporal blurring of visual motion), but they lacked the sharp glowing bloopiness of 2C-x trails; rather they were made of watery mist.


The OEAs were as strong as ever, and took a good few hours to come down from the perceived three-semitone drop and inharmonicity, (Level 3 by t+2.00, Level 2 by t+6.00, Level 1 by t+10.00, baseline by t+14.00; some FM (vocoding) and deepening remained at t+10.00 at least); but CEAs were mostly absent, save for relatively simple modulations in the high-pitched noise, (except during the insufflated 2C-C dose - so maybe I misconstrued the peak of the DiPT - but even then, only to a relatively light degree... no complex harmonized sequences, certainly: this particular aspect of the CEAs I have only glimpsed in recent doses; though I experienced it on a few occasions in the past).


The CEAs seem rather less predictable (less simply dose-dependent) than the OEAs. Odd. I certainly gave the CEAs every opportunity to manifest, I think.


ETA: Actually, on reflection, I probably have enough memories of this to make a vaguely worthwhile brief trip report, so I'll do so some time soon, I expect.

**Smoking DiPT, check it out**


So as some of you have noted I've acquired a gram of DiPT (Which I formerly thought was DPT until trying it). I am going to use this thread to show my progress in researching this material. I love being a guinea pig. 


Most reports, if not all, report the stuff being eaten. I've read a couple IM and one Sublingual. So far, havent read one smoked yet.


Anyway I have been smoking DiPT and here is what I've come to. I'd like to get some guidelines going, or at least hear some ideas from others.


What I've noticed. 


First off, I smoke out of a lightbulb. I find it works pretty well. Plus it gives you a good measure of effects from the smoke. You can measure in lightbulb-ful's if you dont have good mg measurement. 


I have pure freebase. And when it gets hot it melts to a brown-yellow oil. Which then vaporizes. 


Whatever you DONT suck up, will retain at the bottom. Typically though, since it has picked stuff up from the moisture and air, it wont just make a pretty little rock. It starts to look like thinly smeared poop. You can reheat this though.  You know its time to add more (or stop) when you cant get a thick plume of vapor inside anymore. 


I find a very small sprinkle, like maybe an area to cover your pinkie-nail, will provide solid effects. 


The sound effect DOES scale to dose. I find early on, it just feels like it is dropping the tone down. But after the 3rd or 4th lightbulb hit, you start noticing minor details more notable. Then get 5-6 lightbulbs in and you feel more zoned into the song as it plays. 


I'd say so far I've found 20mg (eyeballed) hits me good. And I'm 215lbs if that helps. 


Vocals can sound hollow and computed, or deep and bellowing. And often other notes seem unaffected. 


There is a very strong rush after starting. You get a nice euphoria from the hit. You definitely have a hard time putting it down. 


You find the effects stabilize about 5 minutes in and last like that for at least an hour if not 2. Vision is still wavy, hell mine is right now, everything has a nice flow to it. Very tryptamine'ish. 


After a couple hours the sound starts to kinda die down. It is no longer as amusing. It will still be deep for a while though. Like 8 hours it seemed like to me I was still noticing small effects. But nowhere near as deep as the first hour.


So listen to the music in the first half hour or so, because thats when its deepest and most easily explored. 


Lets chat!

If what you intended to buy was DPT freebase and bought DiPT on accident, are you sure that your DiPT is also freebase and not hcl?


Try taking a tiny bit and putting it in some water, if it doesnt disolve and just kinda sits on top then you have freebase.


other than that, thanks for the trip report. We dont get to many smoked DiPT reports here. Which is odd since ppl smoke DMT, DPT, MET... why not DiPT?

On the website it DOES say next to it freebase.


I honestly thought I had two choices, DPT freebase or DPT HCL, didnt notice that Extra ISO in the freebase one because the website had some mediocre formatting.


So I found myself with this!


Anyway yeah I find it strange that nobody seems to smoke this stuff given its similarity to like 13 other capitol named substances.

Well I've probably hit about 50mg tonight. I'd say it was like 25-15-10. Each dose about 10-15 minutes apart. There is definitely still some left in the bulb.


The doses start losing their strongest effects after 30 minutes. So I think next time I will simply do a LOT more at once. I think the smoking provides a great body rush and a lovely feel. But doses need to be sped up if a more powerful effect is to arrive. 


I had very strong tryptamine high. I looked in a mirror, and this elvish looking writting on my shirt glowed and shimmered and waved. I looked in the mirror further and thought I saw some shadow figures in the room behind me. But I would turn around and all was good. 


Staring at the ceiling results in a black space opening up and it being filled with circular rainbow waves of sound. Like speakers pulsing, or something that looks like a megaphone, but round. Like a pie of megaphone slices. Hard to explain. The effects were subtle, not blinding. 


Anyway, its been an hour since my last dose and I'm feeling pretty good. I dont really feel super uplifted although the music still has interesting features. 


It does seem that the crack cocaine effect is here. Like I'll smoke, and chill for 5-10 minutes, but once that refreshing tryptamine body rush leaves, I crave more. I smoke more, and feel great. Then eventually my mind loses that glow. 


Also interesting about music. It does NOT seem to effect everything equally. I'm listening to Mastodon, and there is almost no difference at all! Also, the Number Twelve Looks Like You sounds identical to themselves. 


It seems the more hardcore intense crazy death metal the music you listen to, the less it is changed. 


But music like MGMT and techno type stuff incurs amazing changes. If you listen to any acoustic, its going to sound really weird. 


The one thing that is for sure. It seems DiPT will help separate the bad singers from the good. Because a few songs I've heard sound terrible. And many are just meh. But some really captivate with their ability to hold a perfect sound, despite being in such a deep pitch and being so morphed. 


Its almost like truly good vocals will shine through the DiPT nomatter what. 


Anyway, enjoy perusing my DiPT thread. I'll continue my research here.

Delsymfan, perhaps the crack cocaine effect will go away once you reach a full on psychedelic dose.

Thx for the interest all. I like going where few have gone before. 


The addictive effect was manageable. I was able to kinda ignore it the 2nd time. 


And we are slowly trying to find the magic doses here. I have read a lot of oral reports where dose curve seems to get very sharp around 70 mg. Many reports from 70 to 100 seem way more intense. But that is oral dosage. 


Wednesday night is probably my next trip on this. If not thursday. Either should work. I'll try smoking 35-40 mg all at once. Non stop until that damn lightbulb is clean! I really want to explore the potential psychedelia this thing has to offer.

Interesting exploration indeed, DiPT has always tickled my fancy but until now the price made it a bit unappealing.

If through this route you aren't stuck with sound effects that can get boring plus you waste less substance this suddenly gets a lot more interesting!

How could we have missed this? Good call

Sound effects DO last a long time though. I'd say 8-9 hours. But if you do this at night and go to bed its not a big deal.


The other huge advantage is speedy come up, and no worries about stomach content. If you have just eaten a big dinner you are still OK. 


Oral intake reports show sound effects lasting upwards of 18 hours at times. 


IV hmm. I dont know if you can IV the freebase. I'm not an expert on such. I wont be trying it any time soon though.


And for this gram I have to say it was pretty reasonably priced. Hard part is just stopping with one good hit, and not going back for more ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

You can IV freebase, you just have to change it to dissolve it in a bit of white vinegar or lemon juice...


Delsym, rather than taking 1 hit and not going back for more. Why not throw in 50-70mg and smoke it all as fast as possible rather than stretching it out. I think that it will prove to be  more psychedelic that way.

Thats what I was thinking based on post #9. 


I'm getting better at feeling out how to hit it. 


My technique is basically to heat up until I get a full bulb of thick stuff. Suck it all up, and KEEP burning. Get my lungs about 50% full, then stop lighting. It still vaporizes for a bit, and so I keep sucking to get it all. When I get to about 90% capacity I stop and suck some cold air. 


Repeat until gone.


Its very easy to hold. I find I can do 10-20 seconds. All the while the walls start pulsing as I hold. The only thing is the taste and smell is kinda gross. It smells sorta like old people. The taste isnt terrible but its not good. Fortunately it numbs your tongue fast so you dont taste it long. Just dont let it linger in your mouth. 


I wonder truly how much psychedelic potential it even has. I think there is definitely some there. But it IS primarily aural. Still, Ive had some pretty cool visual effects so I can only imagine there is more to get. 


I will give this method a go likely tomorrow night. If I have enough energy. I have stuff to do at 7 AM ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

this is quasi related, so i guess i'll post it here.  I've never tried DiPT, but i have done a fair amount of 4 acetoxy DiPT, and noticed similar aural distortions, and mild visual changes.  What made me want to include this is the changes I noticed in MGMT's music seemed very similar to what you described, whether I've taken it orally or insufflated the 4acetoxy DiPT.  It would be really interesting to see where DiPT is most active in the brain if some radio-tagged studies were able to take place.

standing there with nothing on

I have yet to listen to MGMT tripping!


So does DiPT provide a short interesting "trip" and a rapid comedown? Or do the basic effects remain after the rush?

Well the base effect of the musical change lasts for 8 hours smoked, and at least 16 oral. Longer if sublingualed but more subtle. 


But the visual effects and body rush will be gone by 2 hours. They are strongest within 30 minutes. And the music seems more in depth for those 2 hours. I noticed after 2 hours, while it was still interesting, it wasnt a highlight.


And I've read that other DiPT based drugs (4-ho, 5-meo, 4-aco) seem to do similar things, though maybe not quite to the same extent. Or maybe its just that you arent as focused on that because other stuff is happening.


Yeah the MGMT was an excellent listen while on the DiPT. As was the Killers. In fact, dare I say it, the Killers might have been BETTER on DiPT. Mr. Flowers voice control is excellent and you notice this moreso on DiPT. Their synth sounds kicked ass and everything flowed great.

Merged in a thread about smoking DiPT... thanks for doing this as I know of no other reports anywhere about smoking it.


Before you run out you should definitely try it orally too.  It's a crazy experience.  it sounds like the sound effects are not as strong smoked.

I will certainly try it orally probably this weekend. 


I'd say the sound effects smoked are pretty intense though. But I have yet to compare the methods. However, the stimulating tryptamine effect seems to last an equal time smoked and oral. Yet the sound effect lasts way longer orally. Must be the way it breaks down.


Merged thread is cool with me. I'll keep posting in here.


Damn, and I thought I was the first to smoke it...


Interesting though that the first smoked trial was crap. chasing the dragon is not the way to go here. 


Second report was better but still not done well. Done via the HCL salt so therefore it wouldnt be as good.

**DiPT with a friend**


**A little TR/ info update for you guys....**]


I had planned on chilling with a friend of mine who I have done DXM with in the past. This guy and I tend to have some similar responses to things and we have a good time together. 


So, on Friday, we meet up. Decide to go to a mall locally. We had discussed DiPT. He was very interested in trying it out. 


So we rode up to the mall. Put what I would guess to be 15-20mg. We each took a couple good rips out of my lightbulb. I was pleased to find our symptoms and side effects were identical.


We both probably got around 10mg, as we heated up some of what was sitting at the bottom from a previous use. 


Both of us had a noticeable drop in pitch. Also both of us felt the need to clench muscles, most notably in the arms/legs. Walking felt kinda strange but in a good way. 


We were equally very loose and giddy, almost like smoking weed, for the first hour or 2. 


We both had the same bloated feeling which was quickly solved with the aid of some TUMS.


Proceeded to walk around the mall having funny conversations with random people. Then we drove (this was after about 90 minutes, I felt pretty baseline mentally)  to the movies. Took another 10mg or so each. Watched the movie, giddy from the high and marveling at the voices. 


After the movie, we decided to go to another mall. Unfortunately cops were crawling ALL over the place. I saw 3 in one parking lot. So we went around the corner to a familiar spot and did probably a good 15 mg each. 


This time I drove RIGHT away, but it was only around the corner and I felt really good. This stuff doesnt mess up your head at those doses. But I dont advise you drive anyway. 


Walked around this mall, and found it to be really overwhelming at times. Lots of people at this one and loads of lights and noise. Almost too much. But still fun. 


Anyway I have learned quite a bit. When we listened to music, we BOTH noticed the same changes. We noticed the background sounds rising to the top and the main guitar sounds fading back. We had an equal perception, and it was good to see that the sounds we heard were really in the music, and that we both saw the same things.

Depends on the drug Propyl..


I know I'd absolutely never do it while on DXM. 


But something like DiPT, which gives you neat audio things to notice, and a great high feeling for 90 minutes is a load of fun. You find its absolutely a good time. 


But it may not be some people cup o tea. 


Thanks for reading though.

Just wanted to post. I have an official TR also in the works.


I took what I would estimate to be 40mg orally. I had eaten about 2 hours prior. But nothing major. Just a slice of pizza and a hot dog. Nothing major for me lol. 


Within an hour I noticed aural distortion, but the body effects were mild. The come up in many reports was under 1 hour. And it seemed lame that at one hour my effects were hardly anything to write home about.


90 minutes post intake did me hardly any better. It was like how I felt 3 hours after a good DiPT smoke. So I smoked. I think I burned up about 1 square centimeter (area works since i have no scale) and I was gone. Thats in the official TR

**DiPT and tinnitus**


Heya all...


I had an interesting conversation with a guy. I was on the DiPT wikipedia page and saw this dude in the conversation page. He was asking for info on tinnitus. 


Well, I told him my experiences. Of getting it only for like 24 hours. 


He mentioned he knew of two experiences where after 15-20 exposures these people developed a permanent tinnitus.  


In my own case. I fear I may have done a tiny bit of damage. I had done some DiPT about 2 days before a rock concert, in which I was front row. My ears have never rang that bad after a show. And not for nearly as long. As of right now its been 2 weeks, and I can still hear the faintest ringing when its dead silent. 


it in no way affects my quality of life. Its so barely noticeable. Only when you could hear a pin drop otherwise. Perhaps its all in my head. Anyway, felt like sharing.


I still plan on doing DiPT a time or two more but then likely I shall redistribute my remainder. I think its a unique drug that is probably safe for a few good times, but is best left on the shelf after that.

I got really intense tinnitus on my one and only DiPT trip at 50 mg, which resolved after about 15 hours.


It wouldn't surprise me if chronically taking the drug at high doses would result in varying degrees of tinnitus, it did feel to me as if it had a vaguely toxic element to it.


OTOH, chronic exposure to high-decibel noise is absolutely known to induce hearing damage, including tinnitus.

I have permanent tinnitus from opiate abuse. I wonder if DiPT would somehow cancel out the effect? Probably not but worth a go, I'm sure :D


Now to get my doctor to prescribe it...

I get strong tinnitus from DiPT... it feels like my inner ear physically shifts and closes off certain ranges of sound, and either allows others in or just allows me to perceive them differently since certain ranges of sound are shut off.  It most definitely feels like it makes me partially deaf though, in a physical way.  I find it a weird effect, but I love DiPT.  I find it to be highly psychedelic in a really subtle but powerful way.


Merging this with the DiPT thread.

Its a great drug IMO. 


I get the tinnitus pretty strongly when I do it. But as mentioned, it seems to dissipate.


I honestly think its more the fault of the concert. As I had been to two in about a weeks time also. And you stand 3 hours in front of speakers that are 20 feet tall and you are bound to mess up something.


And Xork, I too love the way you notice the subtle sounds over the usual dominant ones. It feels like every instrument changed volume and re-arranged. 


I just love the visuals too. Psychedelic patterns and waving shapes with closed eyes, flowing waving glowing effects with em open. Pretty cool stuff.


I'll likely be trying it again tomorrow with my friend who's done it before.

**Dipt in MoxyZ^.^**


So, me and 3 of my friends freebased 25mgs of Dipt.

and about 7 of 5-meo-mipt.


Here is what all 3 of us noted.


Dipt, is a very strange, very, interesting chemical.


Myself: I experienced No nausea, No Euphoria, No Elation, Just instantly everything sounded like it was being played by some outer space aliens disco harp through a vocoder. My Cats meows sounded like distorted guitar strings.... it was truly, interesting. But all of the high pitched noises i experienced in music were normal. 


A: Experienced Instant Chrysanthemum hallucinations. which lasted for 15 minutes, followed by extensive closed eye visuals. He also noted that it felt like he smoked, way too much weed way too fast, and experienced Nausea. He Said that he and S both sounded like we were big black men.


S: Felt Sick and depressed instantly after exhaling. There were no other effects. 30 minutes passed, and zang, her hearing was off the walls and she thought it was pretty fantastic, next to the groggy blahish body feeling.


this is where 5-meo-mipt comes into play.


Me: Yeah, my audition of the world around me is funky. but i am not. So i pull out my happy lil bag, and my scale and i give each of us a 7mg dose.


Combined *3 pipes we all went together*

*exhaled* 

Everyone is smiling and the colors. Oh my god, the fuckng colors, it was like someone turned up the contrast and the "neon" dial way too fucking high,

We were all experiencing combined hallucinations, and combined auditory hallucinations. 


This persisted for 7 hours. 


We sat in the back yard smoking some bubble gum kush and watching the sunrise. The only noted difference in our Hallucinatory perceptions of things were we each noted a different colored sky. But all the patterns and trails and just synchronization of thought *considering we all took a blast at the same time* was pretty weird, it was like telepathy, with eye gestures. 


Strange awesome times.

That's pretty scary that people can develop permanent tinnitus from smoking a normal dose of this stuff. Pretty much puts me off of ever trying it because I am a musician. Kinda unfortunate because it sounds very interesting.

I'm also a musician, which could be one of the main reasons I've been afraid to try DiPT. I even had some of it in my possession for a while, but gave it away to my friends because I was too anxious to try it myself. Even though I would imagine the effects on audio are quite fascinating. Not to mention the potential for inducing a deeply entheogenic experience, as I've read. There's just something that seems to scare me off it for some reason. Fear of the unknown perhaps?

Just saw that Tinnitus. I never saw/said that, and have no evidence to post such a thing. 


A person I talked to who seems a valid source reported people getting strong tinnitus that lingered for a long time after 12-20 exposures to the DiPT.


So Recept, please by all means try some. You will be fine after one time. I loved the first time with it and its a pretty wild substance. As a musician, you should find it profound.

Has anyone tried combining DiPT and LSD? I'm thinking of trying this some time soonish. I remember DiPT and 2C-E synergizing well (comparable duration of effects, nice combination of severe visual and auditory distortions), and I've enjoyed insufflated 2C-C on top of DiPT (a bouncing semidissociative colourful joy), although it didn't integrate so well. I'm thinking DiPT/LSD could be as interesting as DiPT/2C-E, but more so. Both 2C-E and LSD have given me OEAs in the past, but LSD particularly more so, so I'll be especially interested to hear what the auditory side of LSD/DiPT will be like. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Any experiences with this combo? I could find one experience on Lycaeum, but nothing on Erowid, as far as I can see.

Just wanted to note that I have now developed extremely annoying tinnitus.  I took DiPT 1 time about 7 months ago.   It may not be related at all to the DiPT, because I now have VS (Visual Snow), which is kind of like HPPD but without any of the psychedelic visuals and can be caused by extreme stress (I have static, floaters, trails, and now tinnitus).  Tinnitus is a standard symptom so who knows.  Tinnitus is certainly not worth the effects of DiPT, I know that for sure.

^Agreed really. I find a fair few tryptamines give me tinnitus, at least while tripping; DMT, 4-HO-DiPT, DiPT, DPT etc. though the 4-HO-DiPT and plain ole DiPT caused long lasting effects; though I'm withdrawing from benzo's so that is another reason. Sucks though when it gets really piercing, though mine seems transient...

How much do you guys smoke of the freebase? Im sure I have DiPT freebase and Ive tried smoking up to 15 mg with little to no effect. 50 mg orally gave me and others some effects though, so its not bunk I have. 


I use "the machine" for smoking it. Works like a dream with DMT, so why not DiPT? 15 mg seems like a decent smoked dose DiPT.

You either need a higher a dose or maybe the effects of smoked DiPT take longer to come on.

Im guessing its the former

It doesnt take long to come on at all. You'll know by 5 minutes that you're blasted.


I never used a scale and just eyeballed it. go for an area the size of a US dime, and I did it via lightbulb vaporization. 


Just keep on sucking it down and you'll know. Its fantastic that way. You should probably stop when you get to a point where there are visual effects. If you keep smoking further past that, the sounds change to a metal bell sound, and thats when it gets weird.

He said "after that", so I'm presuming he'd try it alone first.


I'm not entirely sure how DiPT would blend with mescaline, but it does seem to shine in combinations, because that allows you to take lower doses. High dose DiPT seems variable based on what I've seen on erowid. There's a certain point where it becomes much more intense and DPT/DMT like, which seems to precipitate panic in some, due to the high degree of mental changes coupled with strong audio hallucinations. DiPT + mescaline could very well be pleasant and add an additional degree of sensory distortion while maintaining the clearheadedness that many find in mescaline.


For some reason, this compound really 'calls out' to me. I'm only somewhat interested in DPT, and otherwise am hoping to try phenethylamines before many tryptamines. How do you think DiPT would be for an inexperienced tripper? I've taken LSD once (hoping for many more doses in the near future) and will also likely be purchasing 2C-E and 2C-D, so I may have some trips with those as well.

DiPT is one of my all-time favourite drugs (not even limited to psychedelics), precisely for the fact that it is always (for me anyway) limited to a ++ while still allowing for the occasional ++++. A psychedelic that one can "switch off" at will is a blessing. Add to that the lack of side-effects and you have a winner. The "ear candy" is wonderful and unique icing on the cake ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


I usually don't combine psychs but the DPT+DiPT combo made sense to me - and boy was it worth it. The two drugs work so well together that it feels as though a completely new drug was the result.

Yes, I will obviously do this after, but I think I could probably pick up DiPT's sound effects but the more subtle effects are the ones i'm after anyways. Reading something like TIHKAL makes DiPT seem like nothing but after reading more than a few reports where people were sure theres more too it. I have no idea, why I chose mescaline probably just because I haven't used it in a while and miss it. But I was thinking something like 25-30 mgs and 500 or so mgs of mescaline.

Re: suitability of DiPT to an inexperienced tripper... I'd note that higher doses (c. 75 - 150 mg) can bring with them considerable motor stimulation (jittery legs) and, subjectively at least, general physical stimulation. I often find myself 'floored' (as it were 'forced' by the come-up to lie down, e.g. on a sofa) by DiPT doses in that range. But that range is also where DiPT really begins to shine for me, both in the closed ear audials (this is the dose range when, for me,  they start harmonizing and developing more complex melodic, rhythmic and harmonic and timbral structures) and the open ear audials (this is when the inharmonicity seems complete - fully alien rather than merely dissonant  - and the perceived pitch effects become severely non-linear (due, in part, to increasingly high amplitude perceived frequency modulation, I think)). 


But it could be enjoyable enough at low doses for a beginner. My one experience of seeing  an inexperienced (one mild mushroom trip) person take DiPT at c. 40 mg was that they got a bit panicky, spent most of their time in a toilet saying 'I am a robot', and concluded that it was a 'mediocre' drug experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Took DiPT with 3 others today. Laughed hysterically throughout-hike in the woods to a dam and smoking joyously along the way. What troubled me was afterward when we returned to the apartment and starting playing music, I took a grav-bong rip and a loud buzz occurred in my ear and I panicked and it kept growing until I could do nothing but pass into the void of vertigo white out. Came to in about 10 seconds I'm told, my body tingling violently all over. 


I have read that some people experience this fainting/seizure like state when smoking enormous quantities of marijuana, but for me it always been accompanied by something else-first a poorly ventilated room, painter thinner, MDPV, and pot. now strenuous woods hike at about freezing temperature on DiPT and pot, then returning to another hot environment with too much pot. 

Take it easy on the marijuana...

Does anyone know the stability for DiPT?

This chemical sounds like a chemical that you use only 1-2 times per year, so 1 gram of it would last me about 10 years. If stored correctly (dry, cold and relatively airtight) do you think it will last this long without much degradation?

I would be getting the HCl salt.

Yes I certainly think so. The question is: can you really secure that it is dry and airtight? That a freezer is cold is often not a very hard part. But using a dessicant the right way and making something actually airtight those are other things.

I am wondering, will 2-3 mg will cause tolerance enough to affect full 40-50 mg dose?

I doubt it would cause much tolerance - DiPT is hardly active at that level. Might cause some downregulation of 5HT receptors? but probably not enough to affect a 40mg+ dose?

That's what I thought, but it's always better to know if someone got strange results.


I tried 40 mg, and got very nice experience, +3 at the peak, and +2 during the rest of the trip. Audial distortions was a great amusement! It was a bit difficult to not laugh when my roommate was saying something. Voices became "robotic" and deep, and music sounded awesome(but a bit dissonant). 

And CEVs were really amazing, this was the first time I saw form constant(in the middle).

I had similar thoughts until today, but it turned out that DiPT is amazing. I am totally excited, and DiPT has good chances to become one of my favourite psychedelics(if not favourite).

I wouldn't limit my experiences to only 1-2 times a year because of the effects it produces, but because of the reports of tinnitus earlier in this thread.

No matter how enjoyable the experience may be, I would still be cautious about using this chemical often.

part of me says "eat DiPT it will be a fascinatingly strange distortion experience"


another part of me says "that is a stupid idea" a chemical that seems to cause almost malfunctions in the way your brain processes sound; and i fear long term effects


but there are some shining reviews too...

**Auditory HPPD**

> 			Just wanted to note that I have now developed extremely annoying tinnitus.  I took DiPT 1 time about 7 months ago.   It may not be related at all to the DiPT, because I now have VS (Visual Snow), which is kind of like HPPD but without any of the psychedelic visuals and can be caused by extreme stress (I have static, floaters, trails, and now tinnitus).  Tinnitus is a standard symptom so who knows.  Tinnitus is certainly not worth the effects of DiPT, I know that for sure.

It looks like cegli hasn't been around lately, but if you are could you please update us on the "Auditory HPPD" effects? Are you still experiencing them, or did they resolve in a way that the Visual HPPD effects often do? Perhaps Willow could chime in and mention if the Auditory HPPD from DiPT did stick around for a long time?


PS- is there such thing as a Gustatory HPPD? How interesting would that be?!

**DiPT stories?**


Has anyone tried this compound? I have tried pretty much all of the common visual psychedelics but the idea of a primarily auditory psychedelic intrigues me. Unfortunately, there is not much information about it online other than a few reports on erowid. If any of you have any firsthand experience with this drug, I would love to hear about it. I want to know what I'm getting into before I try it.

I tried it in a low dose (couldn't smoke more) and didn't notice any auditory effects. It felt the same as low dose DMT and DET. I guess it takes a higher dose, which I'd imagine would be pretty trippy, so I wouldn't call it a primarily auditory psychedelic.

DiPT is not a "primarily auditory psychedelic". It is a primarily mental psychedelic. Puts me in a spiritually zen kind of mindset and everything becomes rather interesting.


At 70mg there was some auditory .... bending of notes I would say... which lasted at least 10 hours. But overall I could hear fairly normally. It just became hard to play guitar with any accuracy.


DiPT strikes me as the kind of psychedelic that could give people alien or entity contact experiences more easily than most. Although that didn't happen to me, because I tend not to believe in things I'd rather not experience.


If I recall, Morninggloryseed has a couple excellent DiPT reports on Erowid.org

I've read up on DiPT lately. Been fascinated by the auditory effects.

So I decided to add a small quantity of this to my latest order, making this a novel addition to my collection of rare substances. 


I ordered from a quite reputable vendor, with whom I've never had a problem. 

The DiPT I got now is brownish though, instead of a white powder, as which it has been described to me. This doesn't really bother me since it's known to me that tryptamines tend to turn brown over time because of oxidation processes. 


What really puts me off though is the smell. I keep it in 3 zip-lock bags and I can still smell it from like 2 feet away. 

It just smells horrible! I don't even know anything I could compare it to!


Is this also just a byproduct of the oxidation, so that it's safe to ingest?

I just can't get myself to pour some horribly smelling powder down my throat. I just really want to try it though...Masking the taste with a lot of juice probably wouldn't be a problem.


Has anybody else experienced this with DiPT?

The DiPT I have has a pretty strong indole odor as well, though IMO aMT is worse. Mine is really pretty dark brown as well and has been since the day I received, never worried though(very trusted vend). I've really been feeling DiPT calling to me lately. I've had it for years and neglected to ever even taste it.....yet! Oh yeah, definitely put it in a gel cap, then won't taste a thing unless you happen to throw up right around the time the cap breaks.

Had an exceedingly interesting experience recently as this one is calling strongly! I decided to IM, 15mg rock salt MDMA, 6/7mgs DiPT, 20-40mgs of DPT, and 35mgs MXE. It was certainly probably my most interesting IM experience, it felt like electric tingles where traveling through my body T+15 after injection. Definitely going to be returning soon.

I've had this stuff laying around for about a year now and finally got around to trying it. DiPT is definitely one of the strangest ventures into the drug world that I've ever made. Normally the tryptamine body buzz turns me off but on this stuff it's pretty badass. I dosed 40mg orally, and I even noticed some pretty nice flowing visuals which most people don't seem to get. It is a very mental drug, though. The only thing that ruined it for me was the fact that everything is still pitched way way down and it's been almost 24 hours since ingestion. I couldn't tune a guitar to save my life, and even when I used a tuner it sounded completely out of tune. Weirdest psych I've tried by far. The big turn off for me though was hopping in bed with my woman (next day after I took the drug) and getting ready to get after it, only to hear her sound like a morbidly obese man. DiPT was probably a one time thing for me but I'm glad I got to go that route at least once in my life.

This was about a year ago.

First time I ingested about 65mg orally, and went out during a thunderstorm. Noticed no change whatsoever.

Couple months later went on a camping trip, and ingested about 170mg for the hell of it. Became delirious for about 3 hours, and all my friends had different tones of voices. One of them sounded like Arnold Schwarzenegger, another was too low to understand, and my other buddy's voice kept changing from high to low nonstop while he talked. Experienced "breathing" visuals and alot of mindfuck. Truly my favorite chem.

Hey,


I took DiPT several times with other people and sober people noticed that our voices were higher while the trip.

Probably because you do not want to sound so deep as you hear it and your brain automatically adjusts this difference by letting you speak higher. :D

interesting observation, and your explanation sounds very reasonable to me.

I did 60 mg DiPT orally last night around 9. It took about an hour for me to start feeling effects starting with the typical tryptamine buzz and being slightly out of it. Mentally I was pretty much all there, visually almost nothing, just slightly brighter lights. Noise was fucking weird. Voices were about two octaves lower and a bit tinny at times, music sounded slower and really not good. I still have some effects from that and tinnitus. Last night the tinnitus was verging on painful and I would have been worried except for the fact that I know it's quite enough were I was that my ears should have been fine. I took two etizolam around 5.30 this morning to fall asleep


Like an above poster I was very put off by a friend who I was hooking up withs voice and really wasn't super in the mood for anything of that sort.

DiPT is by far my favorite psychedelic I have ever had the joy of experiencing. After 100mgs the visuals become so amazing, and you can't help but laugh at how everyone sounds like Al Green or BArry White.

It goes fantastically with 5-MeO-DMT, as well as MXE.

How does it compare to other psychedelics at that dose and how difficult or heavy is the experience? Any side-effects, anxiety, anything?

There is little-no body load as far as I can tell, and amazingly enought the anxiety is quite tolerable. It gives a great tryptamine buzz, and it's great for all around giggles, everybody sound like like s jive-turkey dearth vader.


Comparatively I would say it is just as potent as most other tryps, but it doesn't produce the overwhelming fear that many psychedelics do. I find it to be quite hedonistic. 


The visuals ate top not as well, I was listening to [John Williams-Austrius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-dqB6Z7JRo&feature=youtube_gdata_player) it it felt like I was going through a musical black hole. Every not had a corresponding tactile sensation and visuals.

Anyone still coming across this stuff these days? Have seen only a few photos but the stuff in question is brown and smells quite strongly if not unpleasantly. Anyone have any other deceptions of dipt as anything other than a white powder?

The stuff in question you refer to spiffypip is indeed DIPT. There is no doubt in my mind that this substance is definitely more than just the auditory effects. I wanted to share my own experience because I think DIPT absolutely needs more research. It's not so much a common trip report but more just my thoughts and experiences with it.


> I put about 50 mg (48 mg according to my scale to be more precise) in a capsule. The odor could be smelled through the capsule and with hesitation I finally get it down my throat. I play some music waiting for it to come up. It was a very smooth transition into the trip. Within 1 to 2 hours music started to sound strange. I am hearing some dissonance coming from elements within a song that I know does not have any.
> 
> 
> 
> If I just stare at something for a while I can make the walls breathe with delight as I was not expecting any visuals. I start to get anxious and agitated as I play more music and it just dissolves into a chaotic orchestrated train wreck. I start getting jittery and uncomfortable, similar to the body load I get on any other psychedelic. However, I am perfectly within my reality. Headspace is clear for the most part. None of the mind fucking and I decide I have to go outside for a walk. As some others have mentioned this substance really shines when you take it outdoors. I hear people outside laughing and talking and they sound like robots, as does my own voice, not particularly startling as I knew this was what this substance was known for. My own breath felt disconnected from my body as it sounded deep and disturbing.
> 
> 
> 
> Lights glowed softly in the night as I became hyper aware of everything within my vision. I take note of the sounds of crickets and virtually every little sound of the night, a truly wondrous experience. Something that occurred to me was that with ordinary psychedelics it is often times sounds that manipulate visuals but I feel that it is possible with DIPT that visuals end up manipulating sounds. The trees and streetlights and sidewalks became my fractals grounded totally in reality but with a subjective view of the world around me being more like the otherworldly nature of other psychedelics than I had ever realized.
> 
> 
> 
> So after the short walk I came home and continued to feel uncomfortable so I layed down in my bed and closed my eyes and this was when CEVs started pouring out in complexities that I had never seen before. I was seeing whole objects, faces staring back at me. At one point I saw two large eyes looking directly in front of my face, first shifting around then staring directly back at me, its pupils dilating massively as if focusing on me. Was this me? Was this some other entity? It felt as though I was looking into the eyes of god and I start asking what did I do? Why was this being looking at me?
> 
> 
> 
> I have to stress though that as fantastic as the visuals were, they were very easy to ignore if I felt so inclined. I could easily open my eyes and feel like I was perfectly within reality. If I wanted to I could have just not tripped at all, doing something else instead rather than enjoy the effects.
> 
> 
> 
> At this point about 6 hours after ingestion I try to make sense of the tonal shifts that DIPT is so well known for. I play a sine wave and notice bass was off by 3 semitones, octaves near or above vocals were off by 1 semitone, and upper frequencies were off by 2 semitones. I could confirm that middle octaves were perfectly normal as certain instruments in music were absolutely as they should have been.
> 
> 
> 
> Overall I found DIPT highly psychedelic, in a forgiving and gracious way. All my senses were heightened including taste and smell. Mentally I felt a bit scatterbrained but in the sense that my mind was just wandering and at times racing. I felt completely in control of the trip and could steer it in any direction that I felt like. In fact the whole thing felt a lot like a stimulant with the added bonus of the auditory alteration. It was really an all encompassing experience, never hitting as hard as other psychedelics, but complete in its own unique perspective.

My hearing was slightly altered for about 2-3 days afterwards. I didn't notice too much pain or pressure in my ears but it was certainly noticeable that something was going on as if I needed to pop my ears but couldn't. And then in the days that followed I popped my ears and could suddenly hear a little better. I begin to wonder if some mechanism is happening in the same way that your eyes dilate in order to take in more light. Perhaps pressures within the ears are being manipulated because it was obvious that my hearing was greatly improved. I was hearing harmonics, elements within songs that I had not noticed before, as if I was able to clearly discern individual notes rather than the harmonies between them.


This substance is a hidden gem and is clearly more than just auditory effects.

just ordered 100mg for the hell of it. as a sound designer I think I'll have a lot of fun with this one. I have a couple synths that I plan on setting up to mess with; it's just a shame I can't record what I hear! 


pardon if this is a dumb question/already answered but are there any other psychs that potentiate its effects? I'd like to try synergistically mixing it with something so as to stretch out my supply a little bit.

It's potentiated by most any psychedelics...


I'm sorry man but the aural effects are quite non-linear. The pitch shift is pretty much random besides the fact that it will go into the lower wave lengths. 

But on the good side: you ate facsinated with sound and it does indeed have an aural effect ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I'm my experience it made everyone sound like 'Psychedelic Jive Turkey Darth Vaders' and it's got euphoria unrivaled by any psych I've ever encountered. I still consider it my favorite tryptamine ever. It's just all around amazing if you vape it.

I have about 80 mg, would it make sense to first try about 20-30 mg and 50-60 mg a next time? Or is that wasteful? I do feel like it would be a bit annoying to be halfway there most of an entire day, I'd rather get a feel for it and take a chance after that...

I think a gram of DiPT is necessayto experience full effects. It requires multiple trials to work up to truely psychedelic levels.

Hmmm don't know I took 70mg my first try and got a ++++.  Introduced my buddy to DiPT last month, he had the expected +++ with 80mg.  We all know you are the resident PD hardhead Thanatos.

It's not really my place to say, but if something inside has told you not to pursue such an extreme use of psychedelics, then I can only assume that is a good thing. If it feels right to take a certain personal approach which may be considered "conservative" to psychedelics, then it's probably not something to regret. I like to think there are too many things in this world to regret having missed out on. But hey, what do I know?

DiPT is an exceesily amazing chemical. IMing 40 mgs with 75mgs of DPT was an absolutely amazing adventure I'm In the process of hopefully getting both . Remember IM DiPT is an amazing ride and RoA, it removed any side effect and you use half and you get an amazing ride!

I'm careful never to mention (until now) when I IMed a hundred or more milligrams DiPT during summer 2011 when I was (attempting) to use tryptamines to trip out of addiction.


Whatever hellish place the person who ate 250mg of the stuff was reporting in that TIHKAL report...I knew their hell that night.

I'm going to be tasting this one in a few days and working with it in the following months a tad. Starting with a usual threshold dose, then I'm beginning with 20mg if that clears well. If that's comfortable I'll work my way up if it doesn't seem to be too much on the nervous system or the senses. I'm extremely excited about it as a lover of sound, but also because the aural elements of hallucinogens have always interested and fascinated me. With almost every hallucinogen I get a fair amount of audio, so I'm anticipating a good response from this stuff.

The effect it has on sound is truly unique.  Music is less pleasurable to listen to, it sounds all jangly.  But listening to nature outside is absolutely spiritual.  I strongly recommend doing it outside and listening to the world.  Really, listening to any random everyday sounds is very interesting, but unlike nearly any other substance, I don't like listening to music on it very much.

I will say if one is not familiar with the music, it doesn't actually sound off....depending on what you are listening to.  Last DiPT trip we turned on some Indonesian music, and then some iboga music...I knew the iboga music but it still didn't actually sound wrong, and the Indonesian music there were times when multiple instruments were playing that it sounded off, but most of the time I was in rapture and didn't actually hear how 'wrong' it was until i checked it the next day.


As Xor stated, being outside is best.  My first time with DiPT (as I am sure I have stated multiple times in this thread) next to a stream in Colorado, nighttime...the only time I realized I was on the 'auditory hallucinogen' was when my friend and I spoke.  Other than that, the effects were that of some amazingly spiritual and cosmic DMT-like psychedelic.  Now it wasn't DMT-like in that it was visual, although there were certainly visual effects, but it was DMT like in that there were entities everywhere and they were communicating with me through sound...well at that point it was synthesesia...and it was all blending into one thing...but the origin of their communicating was through hearing, lots of tones and clicks and stuff I can never put into words but certainly a ++++.

DiPT also caused some true auditory hallucinations, as in sitting in my room in complete silence, I started hearing little sounds, not much more than synethaesthetic manifestations of geometric shapes and patterns, like drilling sounds, beeps, hisses. Some became as if I was hearing whole articulated sounds of things that made me do a double take because I had no idea where the sounds were coming from and they were so weirdly prominent. I even briefly heard musical structures, songs playing in my head/ears, in a silent room, that I had never heard before. The boundary between silence and aural stimuli blurred quite a bit and that was probably the most interesting part of my experience. Music is almost pointless to listen to unless you just enjoy harmonics getting all screwed up. Mind you, up until the point at which tones started shifting, music was highly enhanced, as if I was able to hear more going on in than ever before. As MGS and Xorkoth said DiPT is definitely best appreciated outside, preferrably in nature. That is where this psychedelic really becomes transcendent.

I did my allergy/threshold dose of 2mg's last night and I seemed to reach a +/- where there seemed to be something, but it was too faint to assume it was not textbook placebo.


I'm dosing today. 30mg I've decided on, it seems to be a fair grounds that won't disappoint or overwhelm. I've read so many conflicting reports on the quality of music I'll just have to see for myself, I suppose it really does depend on the listener. I also have Recycle and a DAW ready in case I happen to find some particularly juicy soundscape that I want to meddle with. I live in a rural town, outside it is a warm winter's day so I will for sure go for an audial excursion into the leaves when I feel like I've leveled out. 


Does anyone have any light to shed on what this chemical is like for them when you introduce cannabis? I am one of those people that goes into very different zones when he smokes on a psychedelic, normally I do not introduce cannabis on a first time experiment but I am considering it for this one if I feel very comfortable with it.

I always smoke pot when i trip...I actually will not eat a psychedelic if I don't have some weed handy...and it does what is expected....adds a noticeable intensity to the experience, enhances the body high, soothes out any body 'kinks', quiets the tummy if it isn't content...in short it (cannabis) acts like the wonderful medicine it is.

Yeah, DiPT seems to have a physical effect on my physical ear canal, I can feel something shift in there.  It doesn't happen at first, it slowly happens as the trip progresses, and it lasts a lot longer than the mental effects too, the next day you might still hear things shifted downward.  Listening to music was interesting for a brief time because it's fascinating how it can actually change your perception of harmonics SO much, but it got boring.  I can't recommend enough how important I consider it to go outside and listen to nature.  It makes every single sound sound different.  My main trip I've had on it (that I have a report for on Erowid), I could almost see the direction of all sounds.  Cars going by sounded like they were making wire tension sounds and chirps, in the distance at all times I heard this incredibly deep, awesome sound that sounded like the world breathing or something.  I could hear sounds coming from trees, as if they were communicating.  None of this was present inside.  Inside I had my refrigerator sound like a UFO and some other stuff that was amusing, but it changed character entirely outside.

In that case it is probably best that I wait until well into spring, so that it will be enjoyable to spend the better part of a day outside with DiPT. Meanwhile I'll try DOC and 4-AcO-DPT but this sunday I will probably first go for some aMT again.


I do wonder how playing the piano will be on DiPT, sounds like it will be hard or impossible. That sensation of something in the ear canal, is that like the strange pressure that can accompany random bouts of tinnitus?


Actually I was surprised to read about entities felt on DiPT, it doesn't read like it is that immersive. Then again I can imagine how a mostly non-visual drug can still be utterly alienating if I just recall MiPT.

I am in the lick of it. This is probably the most benevolent feeling drug I've ever ingested, it's easier on the body than mushrooms and has a very pleasant mental aspect which I wasn't expecting. Certainly more meditative than stimulating from what I can tell. There is something plushy in the CEV but no real OEV other than some wiggles on long 90 degree angles. I am thoroughly enjoying all types of music, less-so vocal but it is by no means unlistenable I'm finding. I am currently listening to Autechre's EP7 which seemed like a necessity for this chemical and I was not incorrect. The aural elements do not restrict themselves to simple sound manipulation, I feel a strange dissociation from my surroundings as if I am a receiver antennae trapped in a wavelike void. There is something intrinsically environmental and emotional about the audio work too . Certainly more than met the eye, er.. ear on this one. I will be definitely be working with this one in the future some more. Also to comment on the feeling in the inner ear, I can feel it. It does not feel like tinnitus pressure but more like there is some actual change of operation in there.

Yeah DiPT is crazy, if you read or recall my trip report on it, I was quite perplexed with the mental effects, it was really bizarre for my vision to be 100% normal but to experience the world SO ALTERED through sound... plus it does give a trip feeling as well, quite a nice one actually.  It was like not tripping but tripping at the same time.


And yes, the blocked feeling is actually quite similar to ear pressure from tinnitus, but more complete.  A lot like if you've ever randomly felt little pulses in your arm, like tiny muscle spasms like you can get elsewhere on your body.  But it stays that way constantly.  Actually it sort of feels like it nearly deafens your normal hearing channels by swelling to cover them, and it allows you to hear something else.  Or else that the pressure actually distorts the action of the middle and/or inner ear.  


It also makes it seem like sound is coming from in your head sort of... like being tuned to some other source of sound.


EDIT:  I just posted this after seeing Soli's post... turns out you had a lot of the same comments Diode :D  30mg... yeah the sound gets even more crazy at 50mg and above.  I had 50mg the first time and it was the most I ever took.


I had to refer to my TR for the dosage I had, here it is while I have it: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47042](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=47042)

^^^ your descriptors of the sensory effects pretty much aligned with mine, I also got a HUGE mental effect. Amazing euphoria, emotional and mental content. At the peak it felt borderline entactogenic. I also used quite a bit of Cannabis when I felt it was right.


Before I smoked, I ran a simple 16* sawtooth with no release. I noticed it was phasing and layering pretty tightly, I kept it running while I smoked and it seemed the second the smoke entered my lungs a new, wider renegade phaser was added to the mix. This effect remained for a few hours with all perceivable sound including voice. This is extremely interesting in my mind, cannabis is the ultimate visual modulator, and it had the same effects on audio. I discovered with Cannabis that it seems to effect the gustatory and olfactory systems very distinctly as well, at least for me. After I took a few hoots the taste and smell of the smoke became totally foreign and alien, almost like a soft metal with a hint of melted sugar in it. The taste of the original smoke was "there" but it seemed as if it had been phased and relayered, repitched and realigned in the very same way as sound, leaving the original taste unrecognizable. I indulged in a few bananas and some tea also to find the taste had shifted wildly to something I can't describe. Cannabis also offered some OEV activity in the dark, and some mild CEV tunneling. Very impressive.


By the 12 hour mark I was totally baseline. I listened to a lot of my favourite tracks and they were more or less improved by the chemical, the aural complexities and encapsulation are something I've never experienced so fully. This drug is unique, I've never felt anything quite like this. I'm honestly surprised it never received more attention, maybe I just have exotic taste. A true psychedelic, just atypical. 

Sound had returned back to normal completely by the 10th hour, no lasting tinnitus or strange sensation in the ears. Duration was 7-8 hours of true effect. No diuresis or any sort of toxic body response noted at all aside from the ear sensation, which at the moment seems a harmless thing if you don't abuse this drug. My heartrate only increased when I introduced Cannabis and it went back down quickly. Overall this was a 10/10 experience, I can't wait to go a bit higher and see what else it has to offer.

It sounds like 30 mg can already be a pretty serious experience Diode, yet MGS recommended me to just drop my 80 mg. Hmm don't know what to think. Maybe a try with 10 mg before using the rest is still a better idea. Unwritten titration rules and all. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I am really fascinated by the smell/taste alterations you reported, the only substance I know of that seems to significantly rearrange taste is those miracle berries (look it up if you haven't heard of them).  I don't remember experiencing any taste alterations, and I did smoke cannabis on it, but I most likely didn't try to eat anything until much later.  That was my only full-dose experience with it, I have had several low-dose experiences and I enjoyed them, they felt good, and sound lowered sometimes rather sharply, but the full range of effects was not experienced at all.


This makes me want to try it again...

Yeah, certainly start that way instead. I couldn't imagine being truly overwhelmed by this chemical unless you really pushed it to the ceiling but proportionally to my experience; 80mg seems like it'd be quite a bit especially if you found yourself not to enjoy the effects. I would recommend giving music a try, people report destruction of harmony but I never experienced anything of the sort. Perhaps I found a subjective harmony in the destruction but I really have a hard time with that as I actually experienced enhancement in music for the most part.


I'd like to throw this out, since that dose my hearing seems to have become more "broad". I have become much more attached to the world through sound, and I was very much so before the experience with DiPT so this is quite something. Everyday audio elements that I always tuned out, or never payed any attention are now being directly delivered to my perception. Things that you always hear, but don't process unless you direct attention to it, kind of like the nose in-between your eyes ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) . Musically, background elements and atmospheres that normally go unchecked in everyday listening are now at the forefront of my audio perception always. These are the pieces that you usually tune into with psychedelics IE "hearing it for the first time, you can hear everything etc" (the things people say, you know what I'm talking about) . In everyday environment I've noticed it more legitimately, the morning after my dose I unscrewed my toothpaste to find the sound of unthreading the cap was unignorable, and I realized I had never processed that noise before in my entire life. I have many other examples but this one will suffice. I can't stress it enough, I almost jumped when I heard the noise because it was a brand new sound in an act I had performed countless times.


Now, is this a development related to the DiPT experience? I wholeheartedly believe so. I do not believe it's a result of DiPT's pharmacology though, I think some psychological filter has been raised (or damaged depending on how you look at it) and this is the result. This leads me to wonder about the nature of visual distortions post-psychedelic use, and whether they may be due to the same sort of filter 'damage'. 


This experience has left me with so much, I almost feel guilty for my underestimation of what it would be and what it could offer. Sometime in the future I will be attempting a combination of DiPT and LSD because it calls to me. I'll keep this thread updated if I learn or experience anything new with DiPT in the coming months .

I'm glad you've decided to explore DiPT more, as you are a good communicator of these things so I feel you have a lot of potential to really contribute to the collective knowledge.  I feel that DiPT is way underexplored, and a lot of people who do explore it don't ever get into communicating the subtleties of the state at all (they just say it feels good - which it does!).  My interest in it has reawakened as well so hopefully sometime in the near future I can re-acquire some and add my own observations.

I think I'm gonna start with 10 mg on sunday and wait like 60-90 minutes just to be a little on the safe side, then drop an extra 55 mg or so. That should be enough, I can always try a higher dose another time. Hopefully I'll be tripping by noon.


My question is: how difficult is eating on DiPT? Is there a big problem eating *somewhat* fatty food for dinner? How difficult is sleeping if the trip has not yet ended?

I didn't find it to reduce my appetite although I didn't eat on it because wasn't hungry.  But it didn't make me feel "un-hungry", if you know what I mean.

I feel that DiPT is way underexplored, and a lot of people who do explore it don't ever get into communicating the subtleties of the state at all (they just say it feels good - which it does!).  My interest in it has reawakened as well so hopefully sometime in the near future I can re-acquire some and add my own observations.

That dose schedule will certainly get you somewhere interesting. Your supplement seems a little high, but who knows. I had an empty stomach when I wanted to dose, so I took the DiPT with a bowl of steak gumbo which is a little fatty, I had no issues. No anorexia from the chemical either. I was at full effect at the predicted 60 minutes. Peak hit about 3.5 hours in I think. With perfect honesty, I could have fell asleep during the trip very easily, in fact it almost seemed appealing. It didn't seem to stimulate at all in a way that would keep a person awake. Let us know how it goes!

45mg trial coming up sometime next weekend. I have been sick with a sinus infection and it was really messing with my ears so I didn't want to push it. It's worth mentioning I had never had a sinus problem that affected my ears until after DiPT.


I've been thinking a lot about the feeling it gave me in the inner ear and I'm totally stumped as to what it could be.

Yeah it's weird, I remember at times feeling a little concerned about it during the experience and when I still felt that way a little the next day at first.


I still think it's so cool that there is a psychedelic that works in such a different way from the rest. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

On the one hand I am extremely fascinated by and curious about DiPT itself, let alone combinations with dissociatives or racetams... but on the other hand I am a bit concerned about any permanent changes affecting the ear or hearing, especially since I am devoted to my instrument (the piano) that I have been playing most of my life. HPPD of the vision I don't really mind that much, but I don't want my hands or ears getting fucked.

Still I trust the nature of psychedelia enough to give DiPT a try, tomorrow barring unforeseen circumstances (there have been before, like previous weekend). I will just do my best not to push it with previously mentioned combo's which might more or less be uncharted territory.


My plan is - still - to start with 10-20 mg, then wait about 1-1.5 hours then add to a total of about 50 mg. I am excited to do sound / music experiments, listening to different kinds of music and rediscovering mundane daily life SFX like most people do but also on the piano. Let me see if I can come up with some analysis besides enjoying myself and tripping earballs meditating on phat choonz.


The suggestion I heard earlier to take 70 or 80 mg without a second thought still sounds anti-HR, not in the least because I just read or reread some Erowid reports and there is one about a person approaching ego death on 74 mg.

Looking forward to reading about it. Let us know what kind of effects you experience with your initial dose before you supplement maybe? I'm curious about the low-dose capabilities of this chemical.

You can in this preliminary TR here:

There was more promise with the low initial dose than there was a payoff when I tripled the total. But still, my interest is piqued.

I really don't think there are any permanent changed from DiPT, I have done it a handful of times and although it does produce some kind of physical change to your inner ear, it always goes away.  I have not noticed anything that lasted beyond perhaps 24 hours at maximum.


I find the most interesting effects of DiPT by far are the changes in sounds you hear in nature, or in the background sounds of the world.  Once you hit the higher doses of DiPT, for me anyway it makes music sound very dischordant and awkward (usually anyway).  But the sounds I hear when I step outside are utterly fascinating and seem very communicative.

Communicative is the right word. Allow me to look at this as I am sure Terrence McKenna would...My first DiPT trip (75mg if I recall) was mostly outdoors and it became obvious the state of being well and and truly DiPTed is simply to allow humans to decode the sound of nature into messages from the DiPTed (say it as a word), which I believe to be a band of entities that were long ago exiled from the land of DMT entities.  I believe that the formula for DiPT was planted into Shulgins brain by a DMT entity who was in love with a DiPT entity, and wanted to create mayhem because their love could never be realized.


When one gets well and truly DIPTed, they now hold the key to communicating with these creatures which are strange even to the DMT entities.  I have no idea why they were exiled, one of them tried to tell me the convoluted story but he started getting emotional, irrational, and acted like he was on TV.

It's a little strange to read that you didn't experience any shift in tone at all especially considering the total dose. However, like aforementioned the tolerance gained from the onset of the initial dose may have been strong enough to inhibit it. I definitely felt like I had come up fully after the 1hr mark and that is around the point you took your second dose. 


You did mention some slight difference in sound, and definitely got the connection to the world via sound that I think is one of the biggest thing this chemical has to offer.  I know exactly what you're talking about in terms of the DMT-esque feeling in the outside world. I plan on exploring the two chemicals together at some point, possibly in nature. Thanks for the write up, I'll do one this weekend when I dose.

I've decided I'm going to introduce DMT to DiPT this weekend, if it seems apt of course. This seems to me to be one of the safest combinations that can be done, and even though this is only going to be my second time with DiPT I have quite a bit of experience with DMT so I don't think the beyond will punish me for being curious and explorative. 


Maybe I'll be able to solve the mystery of the interconnection between the DMT and DiPT entities MGS is talking about ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I did this stuff a little while back, I think the dose was 80mg, but the brief TR I wrote has disappeared so I can't be sure.


It really was remarkable to do a primarily auditory hallucinogen. I felt relatively normal, and things looked relatively normal, but my girlfriends voice sounded like she was doing a mock manly voice. It sounded forcedly deep, and seemed to have an echoing quality. My own voice was like glue dribbling out of my throat. It was viscous, and sticky and sloppy. I could feel the sound travel up from my lungs out my mouth, and it all just sounded gross; like I was kinda drunk and had a horrible head cold.


Now, wanting to make the most of an auditory experience I figured Nitrous was a good idea; so out came the balloons, and BOY was that a good idea. As I took the first balloon all of the music started to swell and bulge, much like visuals might swell and bulge on other psychedelics. Before it had just sounded like it was coming out of a slightly fucked up radio; now it was coming from a giant fucked up radio echoing up from the bottom of a whale's stomach. Even after the balloon faded, the magnificence of the auditory effects remained, as if they had merely needed to be activated. Sometimes things would go back to sounding relatively normal, but then, whereas on another psychedelic there can be a sudden surge of visuals as you stand up /  enter a new area / take of glasses / etc, the equivalent would happen with sound. Like the same song would be playing, my girlfriend speaking the same sentence, but suddenly a pulse would be sent out from my speakers, all the sound would bubble out like a toads throat, or rise like an ocean wave, and then expand out towards me like a auditory shockwave, momentarily distorting all sounds drastically, sometimes reducing it all to tiny and insignificant white noise, sometimes going back to that belly-of-the-whale sound.


Keep in mind that this is not entirely in sync with the Nitrous. I did a total of probably 10-15 balloons throughout the trip, and each one reliably brought one of those sound bubbles (for lack of a better word), but I spaced the balloons out, and the pulses were happening far more frequently than I was doing Nitrous, so the level of interplay there is up for debate.


Overall this was a very interesting experience. It's not exactly a fun drug. But it sure is novel. Definitely worth a try if you like to sample oddities. The Nitrous was a perfect complement. If only I had been able to play with some Helium too!


I still have 150mg or so left. I'll definitely be coming back at some point and going all in with the rest of it. 

I'll probably choose DXM over Nitrous though, because of the incredibly powerful more-ishness of cracking whippets— And because K and MXE don't affect sound nearly as much IME.

I've never had full-on visuals from DiPT... just faint shimmering and that intense look, but no colors or movement or patterns.  What dosage?  I have only taken 50mg as my highest dose, next time I do it I want to try 70.

No body load what so ever. They complete experience is about 4 hours and makes everything so novel and funny. It's definitely hedonistic. Enough to where I went to work after vaping 45mgs and all I could do was laugh and smile.


IMO its the base tryptamine with the most recreational potential/rush and I have never had a bad trip on it. Vaping is definitely the way to go!

Curious. I have the HCL so I'm on

the fence about vaping it. Those doses are intimidating though, considering 45mg orally was moderately strong I can't imagine what it'd be like contrived into a 4 hour experience thru the vaped route.

Vaping DiPT produces a more traditional tryptamine experience.  The auditory effects are still a big part, but the 'DPT' part of it is far stronger than when taking it orally.  This is with the freebase.

From what I can gather vaping HCl salts works as well for compounds like these, can be a bit harsher but not signficantly less potent. If I were into vaping (which I am not unless I can't get around like when trying to get a shorter experience from a long lasting psychedelic) I would probably try it.


I'm not sure if I have HCl and/or freebase (got one or two batches), but maybe I'd try snorting if it is the HCl? I still have to try this at a full dose of around 100 mg.

It was delightfully amazing this dipt!

I ended up combining it with some more 4-aco-dmt and a few houndred ug of 25i/c once the dipt peak wore off.

I was with a few friends and we did whippets and hung out.

Later i took a bike ride very high still and had a blast.


Overall dipt is a very special chem imo.

Almost no bodyload, interesting dptish visuals and mental high.

And since im a music lover i really enjoyed the audio effects of this drug.

Well, DIPT indeed seems to be one of those substances you either love or hate. I've only tried it once, but was completely awestruck by the effects. Being a musician, it was incredible to hear music sound in ways normally impossible! Merely listening to voices wasn't really interesting, but hearing music - especially the harmonies, chords, and so forth - created sounds that were completely unheard in this realm of existence. Single notes where only pitch-shifted and "spaced out", but hearing two or more tones together created a distinctly different effect. Very interesting. I have another session planned for next week, which I'm am really looking forward to, by I have a question. I'm thinking of combining DiPT with a small amount of Allylescaline. I've had a number of stellar experiences when combining Ally with 5-meo-mipt and 25i/25c-nbome, but the territory of flavoring DiPT with different things seem to be largely uncharted territory. What do you think of this idea? Any potential problems? I was thinking of doing something like 50 mg of DiPT and 20 mg of Allylescaline. I'm an experienced psychonaut, as I've had somewhere between 60-70 experiences with different substances, so I'm not worried about handling unexpected effects.

When I took 50mg, my hearing was so dramatically affected that once it peaked, music sounded like a total jumble of weird sounds, entirely disharmonious (and I'm a musician too).  I actually had to stop listening to it because it stopped being enjoyable.  What really did it for me was going outside and listening to the sounds of world.  I can't even quite describe what was so amazing about it except that it seemed like I was hearing communications from things I had never considered would communicate before.  For example, I could hear trees communicating with one another.  I heard sounds from the sky that I interpreted as energies from space.  Next time I take it (soon) I am going to try taking 70mg on a hike.  


I agree DiPT is special, and also entirely unique.

Sounds like a very mystical and enjoyable experience! Too bad about the music though... It would seems that it varies from person to person. My girlfriend at the time, whom also ingested the chemical, described music like you do, i.e. completely fucked up, but a friend of mine also got the same transcendent vibe that I did. Very interesting.


I will take a walk next time, see what the outside's like. Maybe I'll hear the trees too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I think it's possibly also a function of how far your hearing shifts, which seems dependent on the individual (ie, some report 50mg just downshifts things a little, while for me it was extremely more dramatic than that at 50mg).  On my trip, before and after the peak the music sounded really incredible, but during the peak sound was altered too much for it to even be recognizable, it sounded like the speakers were broken or something.

Really, you seem to hear bad reports?  There are definitely a variety of reports from people saying it didn't do much other than alter hearing, but in general I haven't seen a lot of negative reports.  But yeah, DiPT is great, I found it to have a significant head trip too.  Some people even report visuals though for me I didn't get any.  But it alters my hearing about as much as DMT alters my sight.

Maybe this is worth sharing here too.


I have a friend who I used to trip with frequently, but he's barely used psychedelics over the last few years because he's become so sensitive to their effects that it's been almost impossible for him to enjoy the majority of his trips anymore. The only time I had given him a synthetic tryptamine so far was 4-HO-MiPT at 15 mg, which caused him to be pretty constantly overwhelmed and occasionally lose contact with reality and act bizarrely. I think he got something out of it but he really only seemed to enjoy the end when he could milk the lingering body high....


Knowing what I do about his sensitives and preferences, I recommended that he try DiPT. I gave him some 12 mg pills and he started off at 24 mg. This was enough to give him euphoria at first, and then colorful geometric visuals, psychedelic audio illusions and the unique pitch distortions to an almost deafening point, and some nausea, and at the beginning he lost the physical ability to talk. He was caught off guard by the intensity of it and was noticeably uncomfortable for a few hours at the peak, but after he got beyond it he suddenly started saying he felt great and reflected it in his face. Since then he has repeatedly claimed to have actually really enjoyed the experience, and thinks it could be great taken alone when he knows what's coming and maybe at a lower dose. He says that despite the overwhelming distortions he still felt very clearheaded at least in the sense that he wasn't getting crazy thought loops or acting out of control or anything. He plans to take 12-24 mg again soon and perhaps continue exploring from there, though only when he has time to recover as the audio distortions lasted over 24 hours for him.


I just wanted to report this because I think it's notable that someone who has a hard time enjoying trips these days was able to find DiPT manageable and worthwhile enough to want to do it again almost as soon as possible. It's noticeable to me as a friend that he's excited to have a good psychedelic to use again so I'm definitely going to remember this to suggest to others who might be looking for a unique, manageable trip as well.

I just have around 50mg of DIPT HCl and I have never tried it before.  Probably I won't have another chance to get it , so I want to make the  most out of it. Reading through the thread a bit, people are talking  about oral or vaped. I was wondering if insuffation or plugged would  accomplish a more potent effect out of it than doing it oral, without  affecting its nature in a bad sense. Some are mentioning that vaping it  may get you a more interesting trip, but I normally try to avoid vaping,  though I can always make an exception if really needed. What would you  recommend?

A lot of tryptamines shine with rapid administration but dipt is one best taken orally.  Ive smoked the base and injected the salt but always found the oral trips the ones i remember most.  50mg is a fine dose too, can give a +++ if you take it at nite in silence.

Thanks for the reply. Suppose I'll follow your advice. Hopefully 50mg would be enough memorable, some reports say that and others need 100mg. That was the reason why I wanted to know if insufflation or plugged was a more potent option.

Smoking it is probably too much of a rollercoaster for my taste. I am not keen on instant onsets.

70mg dipt orally first time gave me a powerful +++ that ventured into ++++ at times.  Last time, 50mg orally with a friend, gave both of us a +++.  Really think the key is taking it at nite in a quiet and secluded place.  Then the more subtle aspects are brought out to the forefront.

Smoking Dipt made it a compound that fucked my hearing for a long time...with no rewarding entheogenosis...ymmv of course.


Edit: uhhhh.....actually I am thinking of IM injection.  If I ever did smoke or vape it...i have no memory, which is also saying something.

I think with DiPT at full doses, music really isn't the way to go, nor is doing the closed-eye thing.  The best part of my experience was when I went outside on it.  The way it altered me was indescribably poignant and strange and unusual.  I was hearing trees communicating, and hearing noises from space.  Really ineffable experience.  I'm planning to venture into that territory again this Spring, on a nice secluded hike in the mountains.  With waterfalls involved.


The indoors portion of my trip with it was interesting, but being able to listen to nature was so much better in every way that I doubt I will ever attempt to use it again unless that's what I'm doing.

Sounds interesting. I understand it was during the daytime. I might maybe make an exception, go camping and try to get a variety of environments to see which one makes for the best experience. Hearing you it pop into my mind that in the darkness in a forest in the middle of the wilderness, probably I'll get interesting and meaningful sounds to alter. I am a harp player so I cannot wait to hear myself on the harmonica, though I am a bit concerned about overdoing it and harming my already not so great hearing, as harmonica is so strident.

This stuff is a great audio enhancer. I took a 28mg dose and everything sounds so deep and rich. 90s gangsta rap is fucking amazing on DiPT! Everything does sound deeper than normal, but I'm not sure if the pitch is shifted. I think I'm just very aware of bass frequencies. I haven't tried a high dose yet, but I think the weird audio distortions people talk about are likely the result of becoming aware of overtones that you normally don't notice. At one point I was listening to a song and the bass line started sounding out of tune with the rest of the song, but then when I listened closer, I realized that there actually was dissonance because of a sliding bass line. I think DiPT basically enhances audio to the point where every sonic imperfection is unignorable.


I have to disagree with Shulgin's assertion that DiPT is a unique island in regard to its auditory effects. MiPT affects hearing in the same way as DiPT, but to a less extreme degree. 4-HO-MiPT also has a similar auditory effect. MiPT and DiPT really have a lot in common.


I wish DiPT didn't have such a strong body load. I'm going to be hesitant to try higher doses because it was already pretty uncomfortable at this dose. Maybe ondansetron will help.

I've noticed the same thing about music sounding less shifted when you pay close attention to it. I don't think those imperfections exist normally though. The effect is not a pitch shift, but it quite clearly resembles a frequency shift. The difference being that harmonic structure is destroyed by a frequency shift, since for example a tone at 100Hz with harmonics at 200Hz and 400Hz (and so on...) gets shifted down to say, 50Hz, 150Hz and 350Hz, respectively. With a pitch shift you would get 50Hz, 100Hz and 200Hz, which sounds a lot less weird. If you listen to some electronic music which is verifiably tuned perfectly the ear should be completely unable to pick out any dissonance sober, because mathematically, there isn't any. Yet with DiPT, there is clearly some dissonance.


So my best guess is that the effect is inversely modulated by attention. In the world of psychedelia, that's not so weird. And it certainly has some crossover with the extremely odd attention-modulated visual effects of MiPT.


I'm curious what kind of body load you get? I feel nothing physically at all until about 70-80mg, at which point I usually vomit but feel pretty good afterwards.

Next time I'll take a higher dose and play with some synthesizers to get a better understanding of what it's doing to my hearing.  There were body vibrations, similar to other tryptamines. It wasn't a good body feeling like with DPT or something, it was more like 4-AcO-DET body load. I also felt very nauseated. The nausea got better after a couple hours but didn't completely go away until most of the effects wore off.

I only dipted once, it was a polydrug binge day.

However i started with the dipt so i could gauge the cool audio effects ive hears about.


It was looney tooney with the fudged up pitching and growling.

Even the wind sounded bizo.


After the shitshow was starting to mellow i added a few other subs.

Idk really since it was a few years Ago, but some kind of nbome and maybe some 4acodmt and alot of whippets were consumed.


Wish i could find that dipt again somehow.

I would Imagine it being a classic somehow, its very unique in its effects.


Since i can source dpt, 4acodmt,4homet and some others tryps its weird that dipt isnt around.

Nice report!  Your description of sounds matches my own.  I have read some reports of just a dropping in pitch at the dosage level you took, but for me it was profoundly more than that.

You guys are lucky. I need to take 100mg to get auditory effects that strong and at that point the body load becomes pretty uncomfortable. I guess I might try vaping some soon.

Well I vaped it and it was definitely a success. I was too lazy to convert the fumarate to freebase so I just loaded 20mg of DiPT fumarate on my emesh RDA and headed out to the botanic gardens yesterday. It was a bit difficult to get the right temperature---it required a high temperature but burned easily if I went over that---but I eventually managed to get some settings that more or less worked and let me inhale about 5mg at a time without any lung discomfort. The first thing to note was that there was a strong "surreal" body high which came on immediately and felt quite reminiscent of DPT. The auditory effects took about 10 minutes to appear and by that time the body high was already fading slightly. I'd say the body high was nearly gone after an hour. The audio effects were strongest about 15-30 minutes after dosing and were almost completely gone after 3 hours but took 6 hours to end completely. In the 5th hour I experienced some tinnitus but that went away pretty quickly. Throughout the whole thing I felt completely mentally clear. I was extremely focused and calm, with absolutely no impairment of cognition or memory (perhaps even enhancement), which was totally ideal for what I had planned for the day: working through some tough math problems. Overall I slightly preferred this experience to those of oral DiPT, since the dose required is much lower, there is a very nice body high which I don't get from oral doses, and I didn't experience any nausea. Next time (and if others want to repeat this) I suggest freebasing because I think that the fumarate was the reason it was so difficult to vaporize properly.

Hello everyone. I ate 90 mg of DiPT yesterday, check out my trip raport if you're interested.


##### DiPT (90 mg) - Advanced - Unique Audio-Psychedelic experience

Age: 25 Weight: ~65 kg Dosage: 91.5 mg of powder (probably fumerate, but I'm not sure), orally  Short info about this compound: DiPT is a rare psychedelic tryptamine that is unique in its effects. While almost every psychedelic causes visual distortions, this one, is mainly auditory! I was...

Interesting, I didn't notice that, but I did notice that for a couple of days, pitches were slightly shifted down.  As a musician with quasi-perfect pitch, it was extremely noticeable to me,.  Could very well be that you just perceive the return to normal as an upward shift.

Yeah, most people that have reported back after full oral doses of N,N-DiPT have mentioned  auditory distortions lasting for one or more days after their trips ended. That's why I've only taken it intranasally. Odd that yours is pitched up, but not that odd I wouldn't think.

I've never experienced a rebound upwards shift from DiPT. Usually it just slowly returns to normal over a 24-48 hour period.


However, one time I vaporized a mixture of DMT, 5-MeO-DMT and MALT and experienced a very profound upwards pitch shift lasting for about 5 minutes. It sounded like time had been chopped into 100 millisecond windows and then each window was repeated twice, at twice the normal speed. Very alien. I tried to reproduce it but was never able to achieve the same effect again. Now that I think about it, it might have happened a day or two after a DiPT experience. So, maybe it was amplifying a DiPT rebound effect which was otherwise too small to notice for me.

I finally got around to trying this (oral 31mg). Since a lot of reports are kinda 50/50 I decided to start slow. Alerts felt at around the 30 min mark and were characterized by a slight trippiness and some minor GI discomfort. as well as a slight feeling of being off balance. I first noticed the audio distortion with my own voice. There was a firepit with a few people and we would talk, and things just sounded barely different than normal. As the experienced started to settle in, I left the group to lay in bed and listen to some very familiar music. It was definitley altered, but not drastically. Eventually I threw on a TV show that I had been watching before ingestion, and interestingly enough, some characters voices sounded different, while some characters voices sounded exactly the same. At one point I got a phone call from a dear friend and I answered it. This is when I really started to notice the pitch change in both my own voice and hers. She actually sounded like a completely different person for the first hour or so. We talked for a few hours about all sorts of things, and as the effects started to wane I said goodbye so I could focus on the retreating effects. Quite a trippy but manageable headspace, body felt great though I seemed to be gassier than usual (not sure if this was drug effect or my diet), I did get some visual enhancement but nothing close to psychedelic effects. In general a very pleasant experience.


TL/DR: Small dose, definite but minor effects, would try again at a higher dose. Also I wonder how N2O would affect this experience..

This is one of the weirder things I've noticed about DiPT too. It's common for some things to be totally altered while other things still sound essentially normal sometimes.

In my experience, nitrous oxide can enhance the auditory distortions, but not necessarily in a way that seems to continue beyond the nitrous oxide high itself. It should mix well in the typical psychedelic way, though. DiPT is actually a pretty good classical-like tryptamine experience when you manage to bring that out of it.

31mg is a fairy low dose.  Also I think it's likely the fumarate you have (or is it freebase)... if it's fumarate, that means it's a good bit less potent than the freebase doses reported in the classic reports and PIHKAL.  My one and only full dose DiPT trip was at 50mg of the freebase and the audio distortion was incredibly profound.  You'll know you've gotten to that level when male voices sound like some sort of robot frogs.

Dipt was the only unsubstituted tryptamine I had my hands on more often. It’s okay but mipt was a bit better in all aspects. The thing that stuck to me most for dipt was that people on it got this ridiculous low voice. So it wasn’t me on dipt who heard it wrong but others who where on it at that time.

If you take DiPT high enough, it does way more than just lower peoples' voices.  Absolutely everything will sound completely different, like DMT for your ears.  Super unique and novel.

Yes it is fumarate. And like I said I have a decent amount of material, so it didnt hurt in this case to start slow. I was a touch nervous theres plenty of negative reports out there, but I really did find it quite pleasant. 50mg would be next trial

I don't, and haven't, but I can imagine DiPT making tinnitis worse, it does some weird stuff to the ear.  Myself and some friends all feel like it causes the inner ear to physically move/shift in some way.  The hearing effects last longer than the mental effects.

After years of fascination surrounding this chemical, I have FINALLY been able to source some ![😍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60d.png) I picked up 1g so I can play around with dosages a little bit.


What is a good starting dose would you guys say? I plan to use it orally. I have never been a fan of vaporizing psychedelics and plugging isn't an option due to the fact that I'm on suboxone

30-40mg of the fumarate salt should give you a good first impression without being overly strong. The auditory effects can last upwards to 24 hours so I would start with a light-common dose first to see if you like it. After that I’d go for 55-75mg which should be a full dose.

I'm just curious, how would you guys compare DIPT to 5-Meo-Dipt and 4-HO-DIPT?

I'm planning on revisiting the 4-HO very soon.

The psychedelic character and flavor was noticeably similar between 4-HO-DiPT and N,N-DiPT. In that, it was similar to MET and metocin, MiPT and miprocin, EPT and eprocin. The flavor and unique character was more pronounced in the base, possibly because the rest of the experience was so light compared to the 4—substitutions that there's nothing to distract from observing them. In the case of N,N-DiPT, there's all the unique audio stuff that I don't get from anything else. 


They all felt nice, empty, hollow, stimmy, gritty, voidlike, potentially profound, ultimately dull. There very well could be some there there, but I never found it in my 4-5 titrated trials. I went slow, knowing morningloryseed had a hell of a ride with this one. All in all, it reminded me a little of DOM but with bodyload more similar to 2C-T-2.

I think I tried Foxy in Tokyo in 2008 as a liquid named "Fable" although it may have been aMT. DiPT was less euphoric but way more interesting with the most intense audio effects by far. Hesitant on 4-ho is your's a yellow-brown color?
