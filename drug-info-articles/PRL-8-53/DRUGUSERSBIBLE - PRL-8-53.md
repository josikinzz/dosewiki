## Subjective Experience

PRL-8-53 is purported to improve short term memory, a claim which has been
supported via limited trial data:

```
“A single study in humans was reported in 1978. The double-blind trial of
PRL-8-53 in 47 healthy volunteers measured its effects on a variety of
cognitive measures. 5 mg of the drug was administered orally 2–2.5 hours
before the study tasks. Overall improvements in recollection differed based
on how many words were recalled under placebo, with the poor performers
(six words or fewer) experiencing a 87.5-105% increase in recollection and
the high performers (eight or more words) a 7.9-14% increase which failed to
reach statistical significance; when controlling for subjects over the age of
30 only, a 108-152% increase was noted. No side effects were reported
during the trial.” ~ Wikipedia
```
Short of engaging a formal testing regime it is impossible to substantiate this. There
are, however, many online reports by nootropic enthusiasts to peruse.

I can confirm that I felt no ill effects from the experiment. In terms of positive
recreational value, this was minor, and could easily have been a placebo effect.
Additional commentary is therefore not justified.
