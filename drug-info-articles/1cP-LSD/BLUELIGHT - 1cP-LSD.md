Starting a thread on this substance (1-cyclopropionyl-LSD), as it is available.  It should be quite similar to 1p-LSD, and 1b-LSD.  Anyone who has tried it, please hare your experiences here. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

When I eventually get the chance to sample mine I'll put a trip report up , I remember the wonder of 1p when it first came out in the UK I hope the same for this ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I don't expect it to be substantially different from the other 1-subs, ie, it will be more or less identical to LSD, with some differences in kinetics possible due to the metabolic cleaving of the group on the 1 position.  It seems like 1b-LSD (the bulkiest group so far) does produce a weaker and slower trip for some, though.  Seems like 1b-LSD had the most variation in reports.  But you never know.

I received this email yesterday from the makers:


"Dear Customer,


We only have a few updates to provide this month.


Firstly, to parrot last month's most important update, we have released a new lysergamide and serotonergic psychedelic compound: 1cP-LSD (1-cyclopropionyl-lysergic acid diethylamide). This derivative is another LSD prodrug and shares practically indistinguishable pharmacological properties with the parent compound, whilst remaining legal in nearly all countries (do your own research). Customer reports over the past month since we launched this product have been overwhelmingly positive and a number of researchers have confirmed our suspicion that the potency is increased compared to the parent molecule!"


There was more than this including a link to the product catalogue but obviously I can't include any more than this.


All initial reports I have seen or heard so far have been encouraging though and in no way contradictory.

Hmm, more potent than LSD?  It's hard to believe, but you never know.


A lot of people have reported that 1p/1a-LSD are more potent than LSD but that's because they're trusting their source when they say omg these blotters are 250 mikes bro (but they're not).

**Zeta:**


For what it's worth, [oral heroin converts completely to morphine before entering circulation yet still produces twice as much systemic morphine as oral morphine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2675771/), so this or another LSD prodrug being more potent than LSD itself definitely isn't out of the question. That being said, I believe the aforementioned issue of people assuming they had more LSD than they actually did for a lot of these comparisons is quite likely.


Nonetheless, it kind of makes me want to keep an eye on this one. It would be kind of neat if that actually did consistently turn out to be the case.

It does sound promising so far. The way it came about was also no rather bizarre in that it was a total unexpected surprise at the very last minute just as everybody D I have prepared for for this Avenue to be completely shut down as far as Germany was concerned at least.


Then suddenly at the very last second they pulled this surprised trump card out and for quite a while nobody knew what to believe or expect and whether this was actually genuine or some kind of exit scam or if they were perhaps even just trying to temporarily deflect attention away from their activities while they continued to offload their 1plsd stock as the new law was approaching.


One thing which is for certain for a little while they were listing the micro pellets on their website which contain 150ug of 1plsd but they were advertising them as being 1cp LSD the new compound and then all of a sudden they were pulled from the catalogue as soon as the new law came into effect and I know that in some cases they were sending out extra micro pellets with Express mail one person told me they ordered 2 and received 10.


So they were certainly knowingly mislabelling the 1plsd micro pellets as 1cp LSD but everything else appears to be legitimate and true and the new compound is now and circulation and I have only seen very positive reports so far.


I did make some acquisitions of 1plsd from the Germans before I knew about this new option but I am extremely pleased for everybody that these clever chemists have managed again to circumvent the evil laws and restrictions intended to Shackle us and keep our minds and spirits enslaved.


I personally really like 1plsd and find it very hard to distinguish it from LSD 25 in every sense in particular the Afterglow and and lingering effects on my body and brain and psyche in the week's following a good trip. Actually my favourite bit about acid or lysergamides is how amazingly well and comfortable and free I can feel AFTER the actual experience.  


And this feeling can last quite some time from a positive trip it is like everywhere I go is a totally brand new place I know where I am am and recognise everything but the feeling is so fresh and new and free with absolutely no apprehension or fear or anxiety or negative connotations.


I definitely hope to get some of this new lysergamide at some point although I did acquire a worthwhile amount of 1plsd as I was convinced that at the opportunity I was about to disappear ear indefinitely ( I'm in United Kingdom not Germany but I have only really found two vendors who will ship here here so far far too I know are totally legit).

Actually my best trips was with 1p. Not because it was 1p. In the same situation I would probably have the same experience with lsd but it makes 1p equally enjoyable.

From my experience 100µ 1p was a bit weaker than an average street tab, while ald was a bit stronger. 1p was also more effective before eating.

Anyway looking forward to read the first report.

So about 100mics would equal 200mics regular lsd? I might try this one soon.

Its more subjective the testers would of had under dosed LSD and lied to about the dose. A true 100 ug LSD trip is acutally very decent and can induce ego death. I have seen tourists come here during new years  and go to psytrance festivals and take acid which i knew was 100 ug and they claimed it was so strong it must of been 250 ug hits. Most street blotter is underdosed if anything this compound should theoretically be as potent or less potent than a true dosage of LSD.

I see, thanks for the information but many times my lsd has been lab tested for safety and exact dosage.

I'm fairly sure that is not the case. And yes of course, as [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/) rightly says, it is all purely subjective, and it's almost an impossible comparison to make accurately and reliably anyway unless you happen to be one of the minority who can have almost full confidence in knowing the exact dose of LSD 25 they are taking.


But it does certainly appear to be the case that 1cp LSD is unquestionably stronger than 1plsd, weight for weight.


It was suggested by one person that you could reduce your dosage by 25 percent and get equal effects to 1plsd and it has been posited also that 1CP is stronger than LSD 25 weight for weight.


But importantly, some subjective differences were reported, particularly stronger and more immersive visuals at 100ug dosage.


It does genuinely sounds promising so far. I expect to acquire at some point.

Finally tried a bit a tab of this and as expected it was much like lsd its self it's hard for me to say for certain what sort of time it took to come up as I dosed it a couple of hours after taking some regular lsd , but it did add to the trip somewhat and did extend my experience,. I also took between 10&15mg of 2cb about 2/3hours after taking the 1cp and found the combined peaks extremely visual with plenty of morphing a solid A++ if not A+++ I distinctly remember having a conversation with someone as the horizon behind them and they became one fluid psychedelic entity which was beautiful.  I must admit it was an extremely clear headed experience.

I will most definitely have to try on it's own sometime in the nearish future when my tolerance returns to base ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

just being a smart ass, but looking at the structure, the nomenclature "cyclopropionyl" is incorrect, it would be actually "cyclopropylmethanoyl" or "cyclopropylformyl" (formic acid amide where one of the hydrogens on the carbon is substituted by cyclopropyl).

I've tried 1cp-LSD twice now; first at 100mcg, then at 200mcg.


I gotta say, I like this better than 1P-LSD; I'd often get a strange bodyload with 1P..


1cp-LSD seemed clean, bright, clear-headed, more visual than entactogenic (though not without tactile effects, of course), and lasted just over 6 hours of real visuals for me, with another 3-ish hours before I passed out.


Overall, nearly indistinguishable from LSD-25.


I gotta say, I like the idea of being on the frontlines with something so new.


I'll undoubtedly be ordering quite a bit of this.

I've been really intrigued by the mentions on the shorter duration on all the small reports I've seen thus far. When you say "6 hours of real visuals, with another 3-ish hours", I'm guessing you are discounting the come-up ? So maybe total duration would be something around 10 hours? I've seen people report durations of 7 hours, which would be extremely short for an alleged LSD prodrug, but maybe they were referring to the "peak", discounting come-up and comedown. 


Regardless, excited for this one, ordered some myself

My experience with 1plsd this year compared tonthe majority of my past Lsd trips- 1plsd is much faster to come up, like twice as fast only 20 minutes and I'm feeling strong effect 45 minutes I'm almost tripping and 1.5 hours I'm at peak so in my experience the come up is is faster more intense and quicker to reach peak.


This may account for the briefer overall duration wrt 1plsd at least.  This is the one thing I dont like so much about 1p. I much prefer the more gradual social 1.5 hour come ups I was used to and expected. 

Some of the reports I have heard on 1cp LSD I have suggested that the come up is more gradual and less intense. I hope this does turn out to be the case.


I use a reasonable bit of weed on acid, which always boosts and prolongs the trip. On up to 200ug, I was able to sleep after 10 intense hours, still tripping but able to drift off at last stoned and tired and exhausted.


No way is the experience "done" in 6 or 7 hours, even on 100 ug. Vague standards for defibition and interpretation here, plus people often report innaccuately on things like this.

Tried it a few years back; 300 or so mikes, standard 12hr duration for me and I think stronger than 1p as I recall; it was a somewhat difficult trip but mental state etc was hardly optimal and I was very self critical so I don't blame the drug which I recall others were pretty positive about.

No, I didn't think of the come up, which was probably a bit more than an hour.

Yep. This, 1B and others 1subs got tested about 2016 but yeah given the chance I time travel

No I think he is saying that he was a beta tester alomg with others for testing a variety of these Lysergamides.  Hence the "notes". (?)


Edit- [@Sir Ron Pib](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/271892/) sorry man I didn't see your reply here somehow hence I spoke for you..

Awesome!!! In that case you’re very fortunate to have tried so many different lysergimides. My favorite family out of the psychedelics.

Its a slight variant on the molecular bonds at certain locations while still retaining the basic backbone of the molecule.


What it is ***exactly*** might be better served if you posed that question in the [Neuro Science and Pharmacology](https://www.bluelight.org/xf/forums/neuroscience-and-pharmacology-discussion.155/) Sub forum.   I'm not even gonna pretend to have that kind of "in depth" knowledge and it's beyond the scope of this sub forum, generally speaking.  Each sub forum has different people who have different levels of knowledge and interests.


It's there if you are genuinely interested.

You ever heard of "1p-LSD"? Or an older drug called "ALD-52" that Sand and Scully claimed their "Orange Sunshine" had been in reality, in order to evade drug manufacturing charges for LSD?


Basically, 1P-LSD and ALD-52 are prodrugs that are rapidly converted into LSD-25 upon ingestion, and which had been almost universally legal until recently. However, due to the popularity of these analogues, a number of countries have banned them, too, so naturally new ones were put on the market to replace them.


"1-cP" references the part of the molecule that comes off for it to convert to LSD; "1" being the position where it is attached, and "cP" being short for "cyclopropionyl", although that word is not really *proper* nomenclature; a more correct name would probably be "cyclopropylcarbonyl".

It is currently "under investigation" ?. 1plsd has been very thoroughly and rigorously investigated over recent years and now this newly released and still legal compound is being researched far and wide.

Yeah,  I remember taking LSD when it was a legal  "research chemical".  It's a matter of perspective.


When Shulgin published his books I remember reading all the variants of LSD that he had created and experimented with.    Of all those mentioned, the one that intrigued me the most was Eth-Lad.  It took decades before I was able to get some properly synthesized pure and accurately dosed Eth-Lad in my hands.   Just because it isn't LSD doesn't make it bad.    Ginger or Marianne.  Chocolate or Strawberry ice cream.  Differences make the world go round.


Enjoy all the analogues of LSD  at least once.   ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Yeah absolutely, just think how cool it would be if things were like they should be and we could still go to the chemist to pick up our 279 ug dose of legal LSD 25 as was briefly the case in the the mid 60's. If only hey?

Just like psilocin and psilocybin?


I would assume any country that has LSD a schedule 1 substance, would have banned these molecules that "convert into LSD-25" upon digestion. No?


Certainly cyclopropylcarbonyl should have some type of synergistic effect with LSD or have active effects in general?

I am very poor on these techinacal scientific aspects with all things, and I dpn't even really try or pretend to understand. I tend to work on a need-to-know basis in general.


I am naturally very curious but with stuff like this, I feel like I reallt don't need to get a better understanding of it.


So I am your laymen here. Now from my basic understanding I have picked up on this these very clever chemist in Holland are taking LSD 25 itself I believed to begin with and then they are cleverly attaching some tiny little additional molecule to it to create an effectively new compound by definition and identification which is not classed and regulated under the same laws.


So in the case of 1plsd,, some propionyl labelled molecule or something is attached to the composition of lsd-25 resulting in a unique and novel lysergamide which was previously unregulated in many countries but has become increasingly regulated over the recent years.


These compounds along with ETH-LAD, AL-LAD, LSZ, and also 1CP-LSD, were all created several years ago, but 1CP-LSD was kept quiet it would appear, as a "Trump card" to pull out when new laws are introduced makong previously non-regulated lysergamides illegal.


Very smart move which took everybody by total surprise when it was first revealed in July after Gemany made the other previously available Lysergamides illegal in Germany (1plsd, Ald-52, ETH-LAD etc).


So the 1cp-lsd is effectively Lsd with a different molecule attached, which falls under a different technical definition and classification, so as to bypass the recent amendment to the law.


Now there are various contrary opinions and reports on these different compounds and how they relate and differ many people insist that they cannot tell any difference between LSD 25 and 1plsd but there are many others who insist that they can tell the difference personally I found 1plsd to appear to be everything I would expect from LSD 25 except for one particular difference-


Much faster and more intense come up quicker to peak but from then on it was difficult for me to distinguish because I have not taken LSD itself since 2012 but that possibly was not even LSD for all I can be certain now in hindsight.


So it is difficult for me to really comment here.

It is allegedly the case though that according to a slightly lower molecular weight 1plsd is only 85% as Potent as LSD as in 85% of 1plsd is LSD and this is what is active and effective in the body after consumption and the propionyl molecule is cleaved off why the body leaving only lsd-25, allegedly and theoretically at least.


The new 1cplsd, has been reported so far seemingly legitimately as being noticeably more Potent than 1plsd and certainly at least equal potency to lsd-25 but possibly an increase in potency somehow by whatever mechanism.


The same principle applies as with 1plsd- the additional molecule is cleaved off after consumption leaving lsd-25 to have the effect.


Regarding safety, I personally I'm pretty much fully satisfied that there is no cause for concern here and no reason to expect any potential risks or significant side effects compared to LSD 25.


1plsd has been circulating the world in huge quantity for some years now and there is absolutely no bad reputation being established or it anywhere regarding its safety profile although show some people do reports some additional side effects at the time of consumption like an increased body load but example.


The reports on 1cp LSD so far have been very encouraging and suggest that it is not only more Potent weight wise but also possibly a better experience and more enjoyable effect, again by whatever mechanism.


Bottom line this is really good stuff that these guys have been doing for years now supplying the world with these splendid options and alternatives.


There are several bonuses to seeking these compounds out for a start the purity will surely be unmatched or at least unbeaten, you can be pretty much dead certain of your exact dosage as well which is a novelty and privileged.


This in my strong view is particularly useful and valuable when it comes to the Increasingly popular practice of microdosing currently because it allows for accurate consistent and repeatable measurements of precise microdoses, this would be much less predictable and more uncertain with black market lsd-25 which even if accurately dosed you cannot be be fully confident ever, and also batches will surely vary more which could be be problematic with a microdosing program where somebody has found a very specific exact dose to work best for them.


This is how I basically view and understand this matter, but like I say I am a layman if that, just a dumb, wounded mortal with not even a pittence of knowledge or awareness on the greater scheme of things.


A song phrase line comes to mind here, David Gilmore lyrics in Pink Floyd Momentary Lapse of Reason album, track- "Learning to fly":


"...Tongue-tied and twisted, just an earth-bound misfit".


A humble acknowledgement of our futile, helpless mortal condition.

Yeah this was "Curie". Not sure how long my silence is binding having vaguely promised it - I like to think I am a person of their word at the same time science shouldn't be supressed and the risks taken, experiences and creative work/write ups are within my ownership and others clearly leaked stuff more freely. Almost all were 1subs (about 10 after 1p I knew of personally and tested (no longer involved))- which frankly eventually got boring for me (I was more interested in really new things more than prodrugs) and along with my changeable mental state might have started to complicate testing; a huge problem for me was it's all so subjective and such tests didn't really tackle placebo, expectation and settling etc. The same LSD proper can be repackaged and users will suggest new effects "different types of acid" then there is the 1p v lsd v 1a difference argument. No one of intelligence wants to think any of this can fool them and take it as an admission of stupid gullibility so everything experiential seemed to be hung on the pharmacology where I think the intelligent are skeptical of results but certainly very slight differences over LSD were *reported* by all and I will leave it at that. Most other non lysergide things I tried are now know (McPT/2CB-AN as 2 examples off the top of my head) There was another lysergide with an amide sub I was the 1st to ingest which I feel should published at somepoint from a scientific point of view - not sure if there is any push to make available; LSZ wasn't a success at all imo and maybe the best amide IMO was LSM775 but at least all 3 were clearly distinct but LSM and other things have been available and take updoesn't seem to have been that great so how much push to do difficult synth work there is now I don't know.

No, it's just a fancier version of the acetyl group in 4-AcO-DMT - once the 4-AcO-DMT has been cleaved into acetic acid and psilocin, only the psilocin is psychoactive; acetic acid is non-psychoactive, as anyone who has ever ingested vinegar will be able to tell you.


Likewise, the cyclopropylcarboxylic acid (which would only be released in small microgram amounts anyway) from 1-cP-LSD is going to be inactive and quickly excreted in your urine.

Didn't the person running the lab/company actually provide analytical samples of his products to David E. Nichols? I seem to recall that Nichols (or at least his research group) did papers on these novel lysergamides, including the as-of-yet-unreleased "ECPLA" (N-ethyl-N-cyclopropyl lysergamide, i.e. LSD with one of the ethyls on the amide nitrogen replaced by cyclopropyl).

Just wondering about reagent testing 1cP-LSD.


Id wager the reaction to be similar to 1P-LSD - a slow change to purple using elrichs, over 24 hrs. Brown with Mecke

results from [https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/nps#wiki_table_3_-_ehrlich.27s.7Cgallic_acid.7Cscott](https://www.reddit.com/r/ReagentTesting/wiki/nps#wiki_table_3_-_ehrlich.27s.7Cgallic_acid.7Cscott)


Im fairly confident it is as advertised due to its source but reagent testing (and proper dose titration) helps reduce my pre-trip anxiety lol

Funny you say that. I cannot tolerate vinegar at all like most things without adverse respiratory reaction but I have consumed it sparsely over the years not for quite a few years now.


But one peculiar thing that I always noticed with it it would make me tipsy and light-headed immediately after taking a small amount like drinking champagne almost.

Leading me to swear that it must contain some alcohol or something but certainly I experience a mild psychoactive effect from vinegar but I'm incredibly in tune with my body for picking up subtle effects from all things.

It’s funny how this substance has been available for over two months now and we only have reports from sir Ron Pub and Pontius Pilate. I’ve been checking this thread daily for more updates but it seems to be lots of curious and irrelevant  comments on here, instead of actual trip reports. My next post will be a trip report. I’d say a month or so. But I would like to add that 1P-LSD is very similar to LSD-25, but not exactly like it in that it lacks that child like wonder. Which in my opinion is one of the key features about LSD-25 that makes it so special. I’ve tripped on 1P, Ald and eth-lad and none of them posses that child like wonder that classic Lucy has.


           I’m sorry if I offended anyone on here but I’m speaking from experience. I’ve been chastised on this forum for giving my trip experience with LSD-25 in the past. I’ve been accused of dick measuring on the 1p forum, by people who felt that my stating my years of tripping since 1996 was condescending of their experiences, when I was just trying to give my honest opinion on my experience with 1p, lol these are some sensitive trippers. I respect everyone and their contributions to psychedelic exploration. I feel like where a secret society of spiritual and mental explorers. More like a family, peace everyone...

I also took my first lsd and other drugs in 1996 at 16. I am opwn to what you say. I have not taken Lsd since 2012, but that may not have even been Lsd.


Before that was 2005. So my 5 1plsd trips this year- I can't possibly claim to discern how like/different it is to Lsd.


I find it to be very electric and bright and refreshing though, and I do feel I have the same headspace and lingering afterglow for several days afterwards.


I dont like the fast, intense come up with 1p.


Some have suggested that 1cp-lsd has a more gentle, gradual come up.


It has been described by a good few, elsewhere admittedly, to be brighter and more posisitive than 1plsd, it may well come closer for you to what you like abiut Lucy which you found missing in 1plsd.


I think it is still very good stuff and can be used very effecfively for healing and also fun. I guess I am an optimist in that sense, just trying to be happy with what I can get.


I hope to test out the 1cp if my order comes safely again from Germany, then I will be sure to report here.

Yeah, you’d think more of us would get down to eating it and reporting. I’ve ordered some. 

Also, maybe folks just have tabs laying around and they wanna eat those first.

Still exciting!

Are you in US? Im not sure how available it is over there yet? I know it all comes from Canada, but then they can still sell 1p.


Maybe the relevant point is this- this release was prompted recently purely by the new amendment to the law in Germany making 1plsd illegal there and it would appear that this compound was lineup up in preparation for such a time I'm perhaps with a focus on Germany because I believe that with the main German retailer could possibly be the largest overall vendor in the world, but of course I can't possibly be sure about that.


So really this change has affected Germany more than anywhere else although so many other countries especially in Europe order from this retailer and from other German vendors.


Still, it is just one country where the law changed. I expect the majority of psychonauts in Europe will still be sourcing their 1p LSD from Holland or other European countries which will ship to their country.


So this should certainly account for the apparent lack of reports coming forward there are more reports coming through on sites like Reddit but very lacking here because these are the serious psychonauts who have not rushed out with their pocket money to buy these new penny sweets on day 1 but we have all been making do with what we have been already, watching and waiting in anticipation.

I agree, we’re stocked and waiting, not early adopters for the most part.

I’m in Canada, so there’s less of an issue here.


But even if they ban everything eventually (not wise and unlikely), we’d hopefully still be well served by the wizards who still remain, manifesting L25 since back in the day.

I mean, like weed, it was cheaper and actually better in many respects before legalization. Not that RCs are legal for ingestion, but they are expensive by comparison. 


Hopefully more research in therapeutic uses continues to accelerate and this could open more doors for a broader legalization.

Like mushrooms are emerging, gaining respect and safety acceptance.

For me, it's that I have 1p-LSD, and 1a-LSD (ALD-52), and I find them both quite similar to LSD.  I also have LSD.  I prefer LSD to all of them somewhat, and I prefer ALD-52 to 1p-LSD.  But I'm much more interested in other things, I just don't want to bother spending any money on 1cP-LSD, or 1b-LSD for that matter.  I'd certainly try it if it was offered.  I am much more interested in LSZ, which should be back soon, and which I missed.  LSM sounds interesting too except most reports state there is a very heavy bodyload and nausea component.  ETH-LAD and AL-LAD are exciting to me because they're totally different drugs.  I doubt 1cP-LSD will be particularly distinct, even though I'm absolutely sure it's a fantastic drug, because it's a pro-drug for one of the best drugs there is. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

(Here is a small 1cp trip report from Reddit, a seemingly genuine guy I I asked him about his experience after his first comment and he replied back with some further details![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


"I took 1 tab of 1cp about 1 hour and 15 mins ago.


Feeling very light headed, the come up is really smooth not so rushed like 1p is.


Listening to some meditation music. It's supposed to be graded at 100 ug but it doesn't feel like it. Maybe as times goes by It'll kick in, I hope.


Visuals aren't there really either. Your mindspace is clearer than compared to 1p.


3 hours and a half in. This stuff is legit."


(And the reply![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


"Yes I did experience full effects, I went into a full meditative mind state. Just went in the hot tub and laid there lol, it really stretches out as it goes along. I use a lava lamp as my guide. I turn on my lamp when I take a dose as the lamp gets hotter and bubbles start to form inside I know the dose has taken effect, seems silly but that's just my guide when I do trips.


I have taken 1p lsd before, I place 1cp lsd on top of 1p. It is way better. It is from the same vendor too. I'm gonna have to get more before they close.


I did smoke weed so it enhanced the experience, I'm on an afterglow.


One thing with 1p lsd I get that I didn't get with 1cp, is this extremely uncomfortable pain in my stomach. With 1cp you're able to focus more, loops thoughts aren't really there. It depends on the person, I would say I was prepared for this trip better than my previous ones so that helped."


Just thought I would share here because I have actually seen this exact summary and comparison with 1plsd a number of times now.


I ordered 5 1cp LSD tabs on Friday evening and I received tracking yesterday and they are already in the United Kingdom can you believe from Germany?


I hope to test very soon just to check for correct potency before hopefully picking up and more significant quantity which I want to do sooner than later in case the United Kingdoms potential exit from the EU next month creates any complications.

I've been finding a lot more reports on reddit lately concerning this one , I've added my experience with 1cp to both although it was a short write up and I'd combined it with lsd 25 and 2cb so it's hard to really gain any results other than it combines with the 2 beautifully and except an increased effect of the lsd I didn't notice anything different to what I expected from an lsd experience

Yes I recall that, was that not also on here I read your comments on it I'm sure.


However, and I'm not trying to detract from what you experienced and report, nor question your own ability to discern and appraise the precise effects of various substances when combined together,


But it didn't sound like the most "controlled" first experience of it. Just harder to draw specific and firm conclusions from I mean.

Hopefully you will get a chance to experience it in a more controlled setting to make clearer observations without the overlaps.


Also so you had already come up so that will certainly change your perception of the redose whatever the compound. Vs actually coming up fresh on 1cp from the off.


(Do you know what I'm starting to like the name now actually I think I prefer it to 1plsd).

Haha sorry Sir Ron Pib, please don't take that personally I mean it in the best possible spirit just my natural sense of humour couldn't resist that one.

So I decided I should properly store some things and might as well reagent test a few along the way.


1cP-LSD (observations are in regards to the solution unless otherwise noted) 


Marquis slow change to purple streaks coming off blotter (over 15 minutes)

Mecke reagent already brown but there seems to be a change to darker brown in the immediate area of the blotter, ~1 min. darkness ^ with time

Ehrlich faint faint purple around blotter after 15 min (will update after some hours - ald 52 took >6 hrs but eventually changed to obvious purple)

That’s faster than 1P, mine took around 30 or so if I remember correctly. 

I wonder what that might indicate about speed of comeup, if it can at all?

Not sure how the Ehrlic correlates with come up speed, but I heard a few accounts reporting a more gradual delayed come up vs 1plsd which I hope is correct because that's my least favourite part about the 1p.

So rather haphazardly jumped in at 200ug after reagent testing early this week


After my most recent experience with eth-lad @ 200ug I was rather disappointed at first.


I came to conclude that comparing it to ethlad would seem... simplistic. And failing to recognize the significance of this trip and its lessons, because I was too busy comparing it to what I thought it should be would be wasteful.


Would repeat, at variable doses, though likely not any lower.

Hey there, thanks for sharing. So I guess Im both kind of surprised and not surprised, as I have seen a mixture of reports on this one but with some to be a step up in potency and all round effects from 1plsd and matching lsd-25 and then others are reporting a more lackluster experience like yourself.


Which I'm certainly not discounting but I'm still puzzled as to what to make of it all at present.


Has it happened I did make my move and place my intended order for 200 last night which I wanted to get in before the UK may leave the EU in case it brings about any complications and the company is unable or unwilling to ship here in the near future which could always happen.


They did use to ship to the USA and I know they stopped this, so I really wanted to get a supply of this in at the right time and while the price is pretty good as well at only 435 for 200 is not too bad really and is certainly the cheapest I have seen anywhere legitimately on the clearnet.


So I would have been happier to hear a more glowing testimony from yourself, but it did sound like a positive experience without any real downside except maybe unsatisaftory potency.


200ug of 1plsd hits me really hard with full-blown visuals and with my usual accompanying cannabis the trip is as intense as it's really needs to be in all senses.


 so I am surprised that goes did not yield a more sufficient hallucinogenic and visual experience for you but maybe there are some factors at play because I know it is possible to trip and not have such a psychedelic or visual experience as a previous for subsequent occasion on the same dose.


And like you say you were kind of comparing it to ETH LAD which I hear is far more visually intense.


Just one thing out of curiosity, where abouts did you het your tabs? Are you US based in which case from Canada?


Or Germany? And is this your only trip except the ETH LAD in a long time? Sorry man you have probably shared some of this with us and my stoned ass has not kept fresh in mind.


Thanks for sharing mate.

So I just remembered reading some of your posts and I looked a few of them up and I'm just wondering if there may be some peculiar Factor which has been preventing you from experiencing the full experience from lysergamides? 


Just the way you report such a fast comedown from the last liquid you tried, and no real visuals from 9 hits of the suspected under dosed blotter.  


I know you liked 1plsd though. Haha, not trying to label you as unable to trip or anything, but I did wonder if there is something odd at play because I think Inhave been aware of such a phenomenon on occasion.

I just found this recent trip report, translated from a foreign forum (I am resourceful lol)


"Had experiences with 2x 150μg and 1x 200μg 1p-LSD, always following the roughly same pattern (no other drugs, always from morning to evening, 67kg, female).  Today came then 1x 200μg 1cP-LSD.  I would definitely sign that the stuff is more potent than 1p.  At no time did I have the feeling that my ego would have dissolved, for that it will probably need more, if you want to.  But the trip was fierce and would definitely be too much for the first time, if you are not really strong in character.


 Definitely violent Mindtrip.  At visuals rather the familiar shapes and lines.  I did not have those clarity moments in the visuals and mind that I had on 1p all the time, so a consistent, very intense trip.  Very pleasant from there, I have celebrated quite a party here with myself ￼ Also less Gemorphe.

 That it was much more energetic than usual, I would rather attributed to the music and the setting, as something to push on the substance.  Since I definitely represent the opinion that in such highly subjective trips, in which a fly can turn the whole mood into the opposite, should not shift any differences on the substance, if the chemistry there indicates otherwise ￼

 Identical were the usual abdominal pain after eating.  I really have to get used to having so much to eat / drink ...


 Anyone who still supports the theory that 1p and 1cp cause other trips:

 The Hochkommen I would call identical.  Insert after 10-15 minutes with the bodyload and the inner restlessness.  The coming down was disgusting and surprisingly fast.  During the 1p Trips I had the feeling that it morphs much longer.  Today, after 5h I felt like I was back on the ground, but then again impulsive and overemotional and childish, but with visuals was not much going on.  Had so far other experiences.

 But before I had several trips with 1cp (and especially with the previous playlist!), I do not want to say here in the sense of science, because you could already interpret something out ￼"

I am fairly certain that last liquid stuff was not LSD. Friends also confirmed its short duration and abrupt end, so it wasnt just me lol... I think Ive still got some kicking if you think itd be worth a reagent test (I never had reagents at the time and its years old now anyway but Id even be willing to taste test it just for you sometime too lol). And its not that there were no real visuals from the 9 hits but not what I expected 9 hits to achieve, given what 3 had.


It should be noted that despite no medications, nor have I ever, I do seem naturally more tolerant to all psyches - not just lysergamides. Perhaps based on experience and expectations and an inability to let go. Or some sort of metabolic factor?. I also have difficulty getting full psychedelia out of the various 2cxx as well. But historically lysergamides provide the fullest trips. With mushrooms and 4 aco dmt being exceptions (both of which I have no difficulty in letting go and losing myself to the experience - esp with higher doses, >=5 g or ~35 mg).


Either way this was a wonderful experience with lots of lessons to be had and an ability to begin to integrate them as I went, as I wasnt too far gone.


My 1 trial with Eth-lad, was far more visually and mentally engaging,. I was fully engrossed in the experience, once it came on . Whereas with this I could have more easily put it aside to handle more pressing needs.

Actually I have yet to try 1p. But for comparison sake when I do i will be sure to give more time for a tolerance break.


So take it with a grain of salt. These are only 1 trial of each substance within 3 weeks.

Hardly enough to make any generalizations

But I promise to keep trying lol


Just thought Id type it up because there werent many reports yet

Thanks a lot mate for that very interesting and insightful elaboration I really appreciate you making the effort in your understandably weary state haha.


All clearer now, and what you say kind of fits with my hunch that maybe some specific personal factors such as your physical constitution and as you were due to yourself your mental and psychological nature, maybe you are predisposed to generally lighter experiences than others at the same doses.


And also you are admittedly still integrating and assimilating the experience.


It sounds like a little reverse engineering is required haha. So your elaboration is assuring to me of the overall efficacy and worth of the compound, which may have more to offer than you were able to appreciate this time around.


It could also be working a little bit like cannabis where there is a phenomenon for some more many whereby they do not experience the effects consciously the first time they get stoned in their life.


This was certainly my own experience with cannabis and was a piece of folklore to emerge from the 60s hippie culture.


I don't mean to suggest that this was your first experience of anything but just wondering if maybe second time around you will be able to more instantly access and engage the appreciable and full of side of it hope so anyway.


Sorry I got mixed up with 1plsd. I do pay attention to every particular member and person on these forums and try to understand and know situations as best I can but I do get too stoned for my own good most of the time.


So I would be very curious how 200ug of 1plsd  might feel for you.


Thanks so much bro, have a real nice day now wondong down and hopefully feeling supreme benefit from the experience which I usually always to providing I don't have a bad time.


My last trip 6 weeks ago 200ug 1plsd was a really bad trip, despite starting off very well and having the potential to be a magnificently positive and healing trip.


But it was the worst trip of My Life by far and has left me in a really terrible place since which I've been trying to cranberry out of Up steep ditches.


It was due to to my difficult and strange relationship living at home with my mum for so many years and some really troublesome interpersonal relationship stuff which has been in a massive problem this year and came out and blew up in a gigantic Style when I was tripping that day.


It was a really awful experience where I had to exercise my mental strength beyond what I had install just to try and prevent a really terrible trip and state of panic at the time.


There were some amazingly positive aspects and I really enjoyed the acid but in the end the negative aspects heavily outweighed the good and I have been in such a dark place.


I'm just starting to get my head together and pick myself up now and look forward to positively again.


So you never said where you are, Europe or US. No matter now I will remind you of my curiosity on that one another time. 


Rest well my friend much appreciation.

Few more trip reports on 1CP translated from a forum in Germany:


"So I can only confirm the above written

 The stuff is definitely more potent than its predecessor, according to my opinion

 The Upcoming is much faster than the Lsd-25 and also tick faster than the 1P

 Started with 200 and that was already an experience, but I like the original better

 The alternative is just easier to order, so I'm on the big German dealer

 grabbed back".


"It was just beautiful (I'm still too ineffective to put the trip into words).  Dose was between 300 and 350mcg.  very similar to the 1p but the visuals were not that pronounced with me (only when I went to the garden to play with the dogs many but no really strong visuals came through.) My journey was from a very deep emotional level and was just that  Hope the vendor is going down a bit with the price but I think 1cplsp has a clear thumbs up."


"I'm new here, so far have vlt 4x tripped, the other day the first time on 1cp.  Have had through the 1cp a fierce mind trip, much more than a shifted visual perception, as usual.  Does anyone have similar experiences?  Keep a healthy distance and still I miss the look a little "depth" of the trip.  I think that belongs somehow to the trip.  For that, the Mindpart is very pronounced as I said ￼

 Were each trips with 100, 200 and recently also 500μg (18h ￼) with refills.  All to my satisfaction ￼


 I had a kind of ego death in the 500er trip, then I was startled and could not remember my name for a short time.  Before that, I had done a movie in which I'm "fused" with everything, typical effect, I guess you know what I mean.  I no longer felt in the body.  Was that an ego death?"


"To 1cp:

 The order ran unproblematically via a large vendor.  After a few days the order arrived, as already mentioned on completely white blotters.

 The first intake took place on a lake in good weather with a good friend as Tripsitter.

 Since I have a pretty big respect for psychedelic substances, I started with half a blotter at about 17 o'clock.

 About 30 minutes later I noticed a changed body feeling, inner anxiety and the urge to move me.  Overall, it was very pleasant and I felt good.

 After about an hour began subtle visual changes to the environment.  I leaned back, looked into the cloud-covered sky, and saw beautiful, circular movements.  I then philosophized about this for a while.  For 20 minutes, the sight was really captivating.  When I turned my eyes away, I had the lake in view and fortunately, the clouds gradually dissolved and we could watch the onset of sunset.  The optics were then felt (felt) minimal sharper.  Afterwards I drank 2 more beers and the noticeable effect was gone.

 Overall, about 3 hours had passed after taking.  After that my girlfriend drove me home and I fell asleep without any problems.


 The second time:


 At 6 o'clock I approved about 60ug in dest.  Water dissolved 1cp.

 As expected to begin slowly at 6:30 pm, I put half a blotter after sublingually.  Then I went with my sober girlfriend to the city festival.  Once there, I clearly noticed the effect.  My legs and arms became a bit "limp", I went very relaxed and focused everything in my environment very closely.  Was very interesting.

 Unfortunately there were really a lot of people on the street, that was a bit stressful.  However, the music from all sorts of corners could compensate for that and the trip went in a good direction.  We finally saw live artists and bands, that was really interesting.  The music was, although not at all my taste, very intense and spread a pleasant warmth in me.  In addition, I could no longer clearly recognize distant objects or people, closer to it incredibly detailed.  This condition then lasted for an unknown period of time.  When he started to let up, I wanted to convince myself of the fact that you really do not need to reload lsd.

 So just before the way home a blotter behind ...

 Home arrived, it started.  The tiles in the bathroom, the wallpaper in the living room, my flowers, just EVERYTHING started to turn, to morph, to wobble ... madness.

 We sat in the garden, deck chair back and starry sky looked ... The whole universe turned.  As I said, my girlfriend was sober except for 2 cyclists and she also saw what I saw.  Shooting stars.  I implore, we have never seen anything better.  The sense of time had already passed completely, so forgive me the missing information on this.

 After staring into bed ... And that was the best moment of my life so far.  I do not go into details, but I could see my girlfriend with my eyes closed.  She has blasted, in purple, gold, indescribable.  Every touch has sparked a firework in my head.  Again, madness!


 When I fell asleep a few hours later, the sleep was extremely restful and dreamless.


 So, those were my reports, have fun with it and have a nice time together here in the forum"


"Soo I can now pass on my contribution to 1cp.


 Short to me.  I am experienced acid.  I tried felt, droplets, and classic cardboard.  My experiences were without exception always "super cool" or "woaah shit god damn geil" (at higher doses).  Let's come to the cardboard called 1cp-LSD.  By the way, I had also tried 1p-LSD, but there is too much time in between as I could reasonably compare them.  What I noticed, however, is that I 1cp was significantly more potent and even in comparison rather to the "original" that I knew ran ran as 1p.


 Visuells: Me and my buddy started with half.  I then about 1 1 / 2h later a whole refilled.  So we were on 50 and 150th The difference was immense than expected xD while the 50ug were really easy, I've nachlegen first feel NEN drop kick get in the face hahahh.  We had watched "Spiderman Into the Spiderverse" and we were both pushed into the seats so hard.  I have to hold on to it because I thought I'd fly right away.  Apart from the fact that the film is so hard anyway, the 1cp-LSD played very well and turned up the intensity of the scenes as well as the color level neatly.  After the movie and later I look at my phone and had again heeeeftige distortion of my phone display.  More than usual.  Every fingerprint smoother had umpteen RGB spiral swirls around it.  Reading phrases was almost impossible because the letters exchange places like the trip to Herusalem.


 All in all potent and especially the colors were in the foreground.  So recommend it especially for a colorful movie or nature walks."


"So!  As promised, here also a report from me!


 Had experiences with 2x 150μg and 1x 200μg 1p-LSD, always following the roughly same pattern (no other drugs, always from morning to evening, 67kg, female).  Today came then 1x 200μg 1cP-LSD.

 Up"


"Hello, have also played the experimental carnival and tested the relatively new substance 1cp lsd.

 I started the day with a delicious breakfast, a yoga seasion and a bath followed by a cold shower.


 At 12:15, I took 100μ.  After about half an hour then came an effect.  Colors became stronger, writing started to move and I made the decision to go to the FFF demo. I quashed this shortly after walking on the street and decided to spend the trip at home.  I got a slightly queasy feeling but could ground myself.


 Have ne time TV seen and noticed the toilet gang that I saw beautiful patterns while concentrating my view of the tiles.  Afterwards, I made a psychedelic journey through my apartment, looking at different things, objects, pictures, etc. for a longer time.


 Then I came up with the idea for me this video


 to look at.  I can highly recommend this and gave the trip a tremendous boost.  Walls were distorted now, with a mirrored surface and faces with multiple eyes.


 At 21:00 o'clock the worst was over. I decided to chill out on the couch with open windows.  Against 1 I am then in bed, looked from time to time again some patterns and at 5 I fell asleep.


 Did not really sleep much, about 5 hours and the sleep was also very colorful without concrete dreams.


 Food went on throughout the turn, with salads, fruits, vegetables, some bread and plenty of water.


 I'm still a little tired but less ready than previously thought, so I feel like doing sports today.  Since I am very careful on the sleep rhythm, I will take the next trip pretty early.  Also would like to experiment with the substance in lower and higher dosages.


 Negatively noticed me that it beats something on the digestion, I had a brief sweat towards the end and smell the urine and sweat strange.


 But on the whole a top stuff and I'm glad that it is.  Since there are not too many research results, I will leave it after the next experiments with it."


Okay that's all folks.

Not a problem, was a pleasure. Im genuinely interested to hear more on this one due to some apparent conflicting early reports. Im mostly convinced 1cp may be a little stronger than 1plsd. 


On the whole it sounds decent. I just find the nature of a lot of the early reports....Strange? Haha, maybe that is a sign in itself.


We forget that we are relying on the limited human psyche and imagination to provide these supposedly substantiated reports.  Maybe the nature of the drug and experience is muffling the content. 


One thing- I never copied it here just now, but most of the guys on that forum have been using the main German and generally are reporting consistent quality service and reliability.


Always reassuring when you await for shipping on 200.

At least they are sending out tracking again which brings nice peace of mind. Only 4 days last time (well 3 actually from Germany).

One more guys, in English from Reddit, another very encouraging one:


"First some things to keep in mind: About 3 days before dropping I had taken a small dose (7-8mg) of 4-aco-DMT plugged to help ease my trip anxiety as I was quite nervous to trip before hand. Whether this effected my tolerance I couldn't tell so take that as you will. Also, I had taken around 550mg of phenibut earlier in the day, although I dropped the 1cp around 11 hours after this so I couldn't really say if that had an effect either.


Headspace: Heavy confusion throughout the trip, although I also felt like higher mental functions remained in tact to an extent. The only exception would be my memory being shit but that's about normal for lsd in general lol.


Body load: very euphoric throughout the trip. Had that same feeling like when you're really tired and finally laid down to sleep but coming in waves. I can't recall having this much euphoria in any of my other trips but this could just be set/setting. I would say this was the major difference between the 1cp and 1p (1p feeling much more stimulating and jittery).


Visuals: seemed like your standard lsd visuals. I would say that there was more but I made a point to pay more attention to the visuals during the trip so that more than likely played a role in the difference.


Potency: the potency was about what I would've expected for 200ug, maybe a little bit more intense only because of the confusing headspace. I only have one other trip at this level so like everything else I can't say for sure.


Overall, despite this being my first trip with 1cp I think I would say that I enjoy it more than regular old 1p. I can't say for sure if the differences can't be chalked up to the set and setting but only with further research can I know for sure."

Anybody up for pellets? I received an email newsletter from the reptilian regarding current and upcoming product information. I'm not sure how much of it I can quote here? I edited out names and catalogue link, no reference to pricing.


*snip*


I received 200 1cP-LSD tsbs from Germany on Saturday, they must be a fresh batch from the Dutch, officially marked and printed as 1cP-LSD. I wanted the blank tabs so as to entirely avoid the soy based ink but hey never mind, at least I can't forget what they are now.


We all owe a great great thank you to these brilliant Dutch Chemists. I almost shudder to think that the world we would be living in without them right now

What great news!  I'm stoked to see a quality batch of O-PCE being produced, since this will definitely make its way downstream to consumers everywhere.. The current O-PCE available is pretty trash, in my experience.


 And a novel dissociative like this MXPr is very exciting!


Then, I hadn't even heard any mention of this 2C-B analogue before now!  That should be interesting.  Hopefully we'll see a few reports soon.


I personally prefer blotters to pellets though.  They just look less.. druggy.  Lol.  I mean, come on, little purple pills?  I guess that could be more marketable, especially in a party crowd, but blotters are just classic, and easier to ship and hide, too!


You're totally right though AutoTripper, these guys are doing some fantastic work!

Yes I think the 2CB compound will prick a lot of ears, as well as this MXE/P etc stuff, I know nothing about those compounds really but I see people hold them in high regard.


So yes, good guys are the green creatures. I wont personally be taking any of their products except the lysergamides, I have accepted now that I cant tolerate any other drugs except those clean tabs just about. 


So Im not too gutted that the product catalogue is off limits (bulk only, and no shipping to UK) to me. I have what I set out to get now in 1p and 1cP, plus 15 Ald and 5 Lsd Californian Sunshine tabs at over 200ug to add to the mix.


All for the right time and situation, I took my chances this year to make numerous strategic purchases while the line is open. The Germans could stop shipping to EU at any point, like after Brexit for example.


Or new regulations. Im very pleased to have gotten in there anyway, 7 successful orders this year so far they served me good. 


I do have one 1plss Micropellet, I can get them from a Dutch vendor who ships here and accepts bank transfer, the pellets work out cheaper than tabs.


So I picked up one pellet to try with my allergies with my last order of 1p in June from  Germany.


We were expecting availability to disappear and for the business to close down in July why so I was just exploring my options for further acquisitions.


As long as the pellets did not cause an adverse reaction, I would have no bother with them vs blotters.  The ingredients are benign as can be anyway, really minimal.


Not like bloody prescription medicines, where they try to fit the kitchen sink and all its couzins in there, so many questionable, suspect, toxic excipients.

I like blotters too, but I've been finding that a lot of people don't like putting paper in their mouths and prefer a tablet.

Alot of blotter paper used for laying any tabs isn't taken into account for dissolving in a persons mouth by the layers. But there are some good brands of blotter that are very small fit a large amount of lsyeramides on them and will dissolve in your mouth within 5-10 minutes so you dont get that feeling of paper in your mouth for a hour or two when you decide to swallow. microdots wont be making it past alot of customs in the down under so i never tried them.


i will be intrested in how 1cp feels like for a heavy experinced lsd user instead those with very few trips. 


I have done al-lad and eth-lad ald-52. Well the one RC vendor that shipped here just randomly closed up shop and scammed everybody so i doubt ill be able to see these analouges again for a very long time.

The RC vendor you speak of delivered mine today, and it’s the closest thing to L25 out of all the ones available. I thought they pulled an exit scam as well, but they came through as usual. They will be missed...

Great thanks for sharing. The trusty Germans I presume if we are on equal pages.


Did your tabs come marked? I really appreciate your report because I am not reall6 in a position in life to trip right now as much as I would really like to and believe me I would.


I suffer the most extreme anxiety in general, and I have this particular anxiety about wanting to test each batch, just to make sure it was all laid right in case there was a mishap which needs to be followed up ASAP.


This is related to numerous scattered reports about under dosed or completely inactive tabs coming from said retailer.


One batch of ALD-52 was reported by many as being dud, about May time.


I believe that the company was in the act of contacting people with those order batch numbers and refunding or reimbursing.


So they must have mistakenly been sent some blank ALD 52 paper by the reptiles.


And a few other confusing reports, like one poster on Reddit swearing them to be scammers, saying they took they tabs and got no effect.


He was commenting around saying not to trust them and seem pretty pissed off. And another Reddit poster who swore his brother took 2.3 tabs (from the Germans) and got very minimal effects, like 50ug. 


Normally I would pay little attention but this was at the exact same time I was in the process of strategically ordering a few hundred 1plsd blotters, so I really didn't need that extra anxiety at that time.


I was so relieved when I confirmed the 1plsd tabs were legit. 


So [@Sourclouds007](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/406796/) thanks man, your early report has heloed ease any sunconscious concerns which may have tried to surface and eat away at my vulnerable psyche.


What dose did you take please can I ask? The impression I have built is thst 1 tsb of 1cP will be much closer to being "enough" for someone for whom 1 (100ug) tab of 1plsd is falling a bit short, as with myself.  It does sound like people having a fuller trip on 100ug though.

100ug 1cP and a couple joints of good chronic is pretty intense. Classic Lucy is still the king but this one is special. It’s potent and smooth at the same time. I believe there’s a sprinkle of magic to this one, but I’ll need to do further research on it.

I really liked 1cp-LSD. Probably my favorite lysergamide RC yet. It felt more potent, faster and more visual than both 1p-lsd and 1a-lsd.

I tried a microdose of this yesterday have been having problems microdosing 1plsd which I made up in distilled water but I have been experiencing a respiratory reaction even to 10 micrograms because I am generally allergic to all psychoactive substances and I do suffer adverse effects from taking the lysergamides but I try to make it worth my while and get a really good trip in usually the benefits of which lasts for weeks or longer so the experience is always worth the extra symptom management which is required.


Anyway I was wondering if they distilled water itself was exacerbating the symptoms because this is very possible in my bizarre case where I react to everyday things which are completely harmless and benign.


So I decided to try cutting a tab up and seeing if that made a difference I couldn't figure out how to cut one tab into 10 equal pieces so I just cut into eight and took an eighth so roughly 12.5 micrograms of the 1cp LSD blotters which I have here but have not been well enough to try so far.


Anyway even at that dosage I could tell a difference in the compound vs 1plsd and it was actually very nice in feeling and enjoyable and I almost had some slight visual effects of that dose.


I could honestly feel a difference from 1plsd and I'm looking really forward to trying the compound out at a macro dosage.

It has received generally glowing reports so far from most. Potency aside it seems to be particularly enjoyable and smooth and maybe a little warmer and easier in some respects than some of the siblings.


12.5 ug did produce some visual effects and a very pleasant experience it was as well where I could honestly feel a difference vs 1plsd.

I was very tempted to take some today, like 1.5 tabs but am too tired and unwell still really. Very doon though. I mean I better, seeing as I am waiting on a 250 order to come in from the new Dutch guys. Sent in 2 selarate shipments, first one posted tuesday.


All for the indefinite futued of course, to be used as and when. I tend to think and plan ahead with all things in lifr. I am the tortoise! But I dont have bitcoin and once this order comes in I should have have almost a lifetime supply certainly at this rate I have several lifetimes supply lol. But we all know how quickly these things can change and those tabs can get goggles very fast in different and more favourable circumstances so I'm just trying to cover bases before the Dutch government does everything they can to take all of this away from the world.


Yes allergies are tough as hell. I'm literally allergic or reactive to every psychoactive substance I have tried since 2005 cannabis has been the only drug that I have been able to use which has been worthwhile, where the benefits can actually justify the level of suffering and symptom management required.


I can take the acid I just suffer significant increase in mucus production and lung congestion but as long as the trip is full enough and generally positive once the symptoms have subsided I am still riding high and feeling the positive benefits for significant time afterwards.

Yes, warmer and smoother/cleaner/more relaxing feeling are attributes I forgot to mention and felt this one has over 1p which has more of a colder edgy type of vibe and visuals. The visuals of 1cp have more of a yellowey/dim lights tint (a bit like eth-lad) that seem to contribute to this warmth.

Yes I think I concur. I took 320ug ish in 2 doses, 160ug at 4.15 am yesterdsy, with a redose at 1 am this morning.


And wow, who says redosing doesn't work? I was off my head all day yesterday on the first 160ug, but my system was overloaded with cannabis to begin with, too much edibles in me to a nauseating degree pre-trip.


I was too high already, I usually am. In fact it's what keeps me from tripping more often because I'm just too wasted to be fit for the task most days and when I do trip now I realise how much I don't like being this stoned all the time out of habit and escapism.


Potent vapor on top of edibles always. So the first 160ug hit me hard. I was also in the most terrible physical condition of unimaginable exhaustion and sleep deprivation and I had a little incident last week where I crushed my sternum tidying and I'm sure I have fractured some ribs and done some damage right in the middle of my chest which I've been just hoping with passing the time each day, trying to be as comfortable as possible.


 it has been incredibly painful and my whole body and structure especially back is killing me to pieces I need a chiropractor this week for sure to adjust the sternum to make it easier to breathe again because my respiratory symptoms have been much harder to manage since.


And I have a severe case of gastritis and and stomach helicobacter pylori infection with terrible digestion at present and I was full up of of waste and undigested food and really not feeling very pleasant in any way at all when I dropped this acid at 4:15 a.m. yesterday.


I know it's crazy isn't it my life is totally nuts but I sometimes can't get myself out of a rut and get my head straight until I have had a good trip and I just have to force the issue which usually tends to be at the worst possible time because that's why I can't take anymore lol!


So my initial come up yesterday was really difficult because if I had not dropped the acid I would have been fighting to stay conscious for a bit longer to digest some more food before I could no longer stay awake. So I was just 100% please and exhausted with absolutely nothing left I felt safe if the whole time because it is a very safe drug and that's not what I mean I mean my physical condition which a few weeks ago was in a much more critical state nutritionally and energy wise.


But it was for for quite some hours a pretty bad trip because of the physical intensity of the suffering and anxiety levels from being so tired and in so much pain.

I have to be really strong in my head not to let the bad trip take over and just pass the time and focus on picking my head up up and motivating my body as the trip progresses and once a peak starts to ease off.


My stomach was in the most terrible condition with awful gas and indigestion and feeling sick as hell from cannabis over intoxication and general poor digestion etc plus the acid can be very problematic with my guts.


I tried to remedy this state of extreme discomfort and distress by straining a cup of of Durban poison cannabis tea which can be very soothing and cleansing for the digestive tract and colon.


Except I really did not need any more cannabis because I had vaporized several very large potent hits just as I was coming up on the first 160 ug on Sunday morning.


It was after this that I tried to simply get comfortable thinking I could right now to come up and somehow benefit from the trip and getting myself into a better place to to make more progress recovering physically afterwards.


Listening to music in the dark while waiting for like to come and bring some welcome distraction was not such a good idea and really was quite a bad trip until I changed the situation. I mean it was getting pretty unbearable laying there in such extreme discomfort with a really intense come up magnified by the edibles in me and strong vaporizer effects.


So yesterday was a truly crazy day I ended up going out to loads of shops and places with my mum in the car like the tip and I was absolutely smashed out of my head from total sleep deprivation and exhaustion and high pain levels while being completely wasted on weed and 1cP-Lsd.


I was not in a state to interact with members of the public at all which is very rare for me me but I wasn't bothered about this I didn't give a toss I just did what I needed to do to get through yesterday.


So it was a crazy long day with a very high level of physical suffering throughout but the bad trip was turned around fairly early on by my my skilled head when it comes to the situation.  I mean it was an incredibly bad trip physically and mentally like doom and terror, I knew I would be alright but I didn't know if I could bear the suffering intensity and the negative thoughts that come with being in so much pain and lack of control.


I had the dig deep deep down just to stay calm and positive and focus on picking up and improving my symptoms and getting more comfortable and motivated and keeping my anxiety levels in check as the day warmed up and went on.


Vaped early afternoon while out, and Durban Poison vapor got me blasted at 7 pm, bumping up the 1cP strongly as good Sativa weed does for me. 


Major stomach and and got upset prevented me from eating until very late by which time I was so tired and anxious about not being able to eat and get comfortable to sleep again. I was already fighting for consciousness as I often am.


So, guess what? Before getting too much into my late dinner, I spontaneously dropped another 160 ug worth roughly of 1cp LSD.

Often in the past when I have redosed after going through the initial torturous come up at times and then feeling relieved and physically comfortable I can redose without experiencing the same distressful symptoms such as gastrointestinal and respiratory effects and general anxiety etc.


So I hoped I would be able to continue with my food food with the acid hopefully picking my mind and spirit back up again and giving me some energy to to ride out out the situation going forwards.


Whoops, big mistake(?) I came up pretty hard and very noticeably much stronger than I would have expected and actually hoped lol. I think I could feel it as soon as I put the tabs in my mouth I even considered spitting them out. Redosing has always worked for me, as long as I picked the right moment and often can be more powerful than the initial experience in a different way but more transcendentally.


This was really physically strong again and I quickly lost my appetite and felt pretty nauseous but just very wasted with that strong physical LSD like bodily feeling which made food feel totally alien and weird.


Somehow I was sort of managing to continue to eat because it did taste nice and I knew I needed to feed badly I wanted to see if I could eat as much of it as possible without anxiety and indigestion and just take things from there.


But the redose was coming on on intensely and building and it was pretty difficult. I didn't finish all of my food I made some strategic decisions about what to leave and what to to focus on and I did a remarkable job to eat what I did, coming up very strongly and anxious as hell about the situation.


Finally finished eating at 3 a.m. and I had to fight so hard to stay awake despite the intensity of the acid effects. (I had more edibles before my food as well poorly for stomach upset purposes.)


I forced myself up, washed up dishes! I then spent a good hour our stay conscious and mobile for digestion sake while I managed my respiratory symptoms with essential oils and and various approaches to clear as much mucus from my lungs as possible which is standard after food daily.


But it is always a very painful and exhausting experience. I somehow got through this and was much more comfortable all round when I vaporizer as much weed as I had the energy for or at about 5 a.m. this morning which again boosted the intensity of the second 160 ug dose.


I had to get comfortable at that point because I could not stand or stay conscious any longer and I faded off into a sleep resting back.


I woke up after two-and-a-half Hours several hours ago this morning and felt surprisingly clearer and more positive and more comfortable, and really actually very ok much to my surprise and pleasure.


So I got up and vaporized a load of some fantastic outdoor sativa weed and I looked out of the window and wow I felt absolutely incredible like ecstatically hi buzzing physically in that mad way LSD 25 has always made me feel, like scintillating vibrations and energy flowing through my body but feeling completely cleansed and refreshed physically and mentally while everything looked amazing and crystal clear and brand new.


I was honestly feeling higher and better than at any point in the trip and there is no way I would have have gotten here without that second 160ug dose, 21 hours later.


Suddenly I could see all of the glory in this compound there is no way I would have expected to feel so amazingly high and cleansed and satisfied from this overall dosage.


Im still off my chops now, except my vaporizer high has leveled out which I'm going to re top shortly.


But for sure I really like 1cp LSD from this experience and feeling right now today it really does resemble lsd-25 very closely from my memory and I don't feel that anything is really lacking. I expect an amazing after go and lasting positive feelings from the trip which is not even over yet.


I feel it really physically throughout my whole body in that really pure but clean way I have felt with strong lsd-25 in the past. A really wonderful and pleasant feeling and very strong too right now. Really warm as you say, [@babooon87](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/119267/) 


My head went really deep on this trip as well and I was freaking out quite a lot on each dose to be fair. I mean both times it felt like a mistake and I thought I had stitched myself up for an ordeal I wasn't fit for lol.


But Im so thankful right now that I plunged through it. I feel a lot more comfortable and grounded and relaxed in every way and I'm also as high as I need to be still buzzing and feeling pretty wrecked. 


Bottom line, 1cP-LSD I LIKE a lot! Strong, warm, visual, physically scintillating and engulfing like Lsd 25 has been for me. Like how you feel, that mad buzz on your chest and face from amazing strong sativa weed.  That sort of feeling I mean.


And...redosing absolutely CAN work, as long as you have not really slept off the initial effects and pick the right moment for your consciousness to enter a different stage of the experience.

Wow man, that's a nice trip report!  I read it all and was going to say I'm sorry it was so rough for you, but you turned it around like a pro and in the end, I'm really glad it was such a great experience for you. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


You should post that in Trip Reports.   Add to the relatively small body of TRs about 1cp-LSD.


Oh wait, I see you already did, cheers. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I was also in the most terrible physical condition of unimaginable exhaustion and sleep deprivation and I had a little incident last week where I crushed my sternum tidying and I'm sure I have fractured some ribs and done some damage right in the middle of my chest which I've been just hoping with passing the time each day, trying to be as comfortable as possible.

So I was just 100% please and exhausted with absolutely nothing left I felt safe if the whole time because it is a very safe drug and that's not what I mean I mean my physical condition which a few weeks ago was in a much more critical state nutritionally and energy wise.

Each of your posts seem to take the words out of my mouth. also noticed redosing to work surprisingly well. A day that started at 10 am with a 25 ug microdose ended up being around 250 total at midnight. All the doses were staggered through the day with each 25-50 ug redose being fully effective it seemed. It was a VERY productive day I did chores I had been putting off for weeks. I think this may be the ultimate drug to treat my add. After over 60 different drugs experimented in the last 15 years I could have at last found it ! Hahaha ok maybe I am being over- romantical about it but other reports seem to report the same effects. At least it seems consistant in the way it affects different people. Need to order more and furthur experiment with this one !

Thanks a lot man really appreciate those words and just you showing an interest as I have full respect for your all rpund presence, demeanour, vast experience and contributions here.


I am a good psychonaut when it comes to keeping it together, leaving a secure breadcrumb trail, like an opportunist in wait.


[@babooon87](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/119267/) that's interesting, and Im very glad to hear that you feel it has genunuine potential to benefit you therapeutically.


I have had an idea that in future I may actually combine this with 1plsd and take one tab of each which would be like a stronger than 200 ug 1plsd trip and a little Tamar than taking 200 ug of 1cp LSD off the bat which could be closer to 250 ug of LSD 25 if it does appear through time that there is possibly an even stronger effect but we will have to see with more experimentation. 


But I'm really liking the idea of taking one tab of each has a great way to use up the 1p I have in the fridge without feeling like things are lackluster vs the 1cP on the way from Holland atm.


I did also start microdosing 2 weeks ago approaching this trip.

Yeah, one tab of each makes a lot of sense. You seem to decribe 1cp as the closest to LSD-25 so what would the 1p add in the mix ? My guess is stimulation and duration. I have not had actual LSD since a very long time so I dont remember exactly how it was compared to these analogs. What I remember was the stimulation, the infinite clean energy that makes you walk miles and miles all night like its nothing. That level of clean energy had really impressed the meth-head I was at the time !

Hehe, the "advantage" to combining the two together, is that that way I can make more enjoyable use of the 1p tabs I stocked up on and refigerated for future sake, largely with microdosing in mind for my mum and I.


It was looking like it was going to disappear this summer, at least from Germany and I didn't find any Dutch options who ship to UK but one, more pricy than Germans and my options were already limited to those two.


But the cunning swines, they never said- "Hey, Auto, chill bro. We have an even better lysergamide secretly in wait, you're gonna love it."


But, my logic is using them together, one each, I won't be feeling the 1plsd trips are lacking or less enjoyable, as the balance will be there, like different strains of weed can complement each other so that neither is inadequate and there is a different "signature" to the overall effect. 


And 200ug of 1plsd is a good dose, but could actually be stronger. One 1p tab, one 1cP tab will be a bigger hit and better all round effect, where I doubt I will be thinking- half of this trip is only 1p! If you get me, plus it is the anticipation of the unknown too which adds a bit more fun and excitement to things which massively benefits my anxiety and helps me to look forward and prepare with positive mental anticipation which is almost the opposite of anxiety- Excitement!

I agree... I have the upmost respect for Xorkoth. His vast experience and contributions to this sight are a shining light for Bluelight. I am inspired by the fact he overcame his opiate addiction, which has haunted me for 20 years. I used to mostly hangout in sober living, which has been rather dead lately but now I'm starting to feel more at home in the Psych forum, which sees a lot of traffic and can count some of the brighter and interesting Bluelight bulbs as contribiters.


I am also considering microdosing. If IcP-LSD is cheaper than my darknet 25 then I would consider going with that. What are the qaulitative differences in the 2? They sound very similar. Also for anyone who has microdosed before, would I still be able to enjoy periodic full trip experiences by just up'ing my dose or does microdosing take away the full magic?

Also for anyone who has microdosed before, would I still be able to enjoy periodic full trip experiences by just up'ing my dose or does microdosing take away the full magic?

These are very good questions and I'm in the process of experimenting and finding out currently because I did start microdosing for nearly two weeks before I embarked on my spontaneous macro trip at the weekend.


And I also tripped again since last night I took 1 tab of 1cp LSD last night, and then I also took 200ug combined of a 150 ug 1plsd micro pellet and half a 1cp LSD blotter at 8:12 a.m. today, 300ug total half each. Lots of good vapor. 


I also made a strong cup of Durban poison tea when I was reaching the peak of the 200ug dose this lunchtime and the tea was excellent it really brought on the trip and gave it longevity into the early evening, good vapor on top. So I've been supplementing fairly heavily with cannabis, but no issues. I did have a slight anxiety Spike and that sort of edginess and uncertainty for a while after vaping a good bit but then I kind of like that and I think if you don't get any of that on a trip sometimes you're sort of missing out lol!  


But not always of course. But like, perfectly comforrable, grounded and assured at all stages of the trip whatever level of cannabis potentiation and enhancement.


And I have had another really good trip all in all which has given me so much and being thoroughly enjoyable but this time completely comfortable from the off with no difficulty and no anxiety.


I have always been fairly flexible with the way I have approached tripping and often I have followed up a trip with another one where I am automatically in a more positive and relaxed mind set and body to begin with.


Anyway this was again completely spontaneous and in my mind I was thinking I would like to get back on the microdosing again I wonder what the approach would be and if I would need to wait like a week or more.


But now that I have tripped again last night I imagine my best bet would be to wait 1 or 2 weeks at least and then to resume the microdosing.


That would make sense to me anyway if I can discipline myself lol!


I have actually been tolerating the the acid very well seemingly better than my microdoses I am very comfortable in my breathing and lungs and I'm also overcoming al lot of my anxieties about tripping which have been related to my health complications.

Yeah you should wait 1-2 weeks for sure, 2 at least, ideally.  You don't want to start to develop long-term tolerance, as it takes a long time to go away.  Tripping too many times in a short span, chronically, results in not being able to trip very much even when you try.  It seems like most people even recommend waiting a few days in between microdoses.

Thanks for your thoughts again. Really helpful and appreciated having yourself and others here as a sounding board. Always very grounding and assuring, especially when I have been tripping.


And what you say above fits with my intuitive feelings on it, regarding the microdosing after these 2 trips.


No way do I ever want to lose the ability to trip. I have always tripped like this to be honest since the early days, like 1996 for me with little "black star" microdots (they weren't very strong probably 40/50 mics if that).


Like, several trips bundled together over a few days, or a week, 3 times in a week for example. Really spontaneously, in a creative but purely positive way, capitalising on the sudden release and freedom and insight from the first and each trip.


I have really overcome my fears about tripping, which I have have had this year since getting back into lysergamides, after the discovery of the clearnet availability.


It has been purely related to my health condition and the fact that I have been so extremely uncomfortable and exhausted with with the highest level of anxiety and general body discomfort and weakness and pain the whole of this year due to so many different conditions.


And things have been so tough and miserable and I have been desperately longing to trip more regularly because I always come out of it feeling much better all round in life.


But it's a hard thing to face when you don't feel good especially if you have anxiety about it and I had some major anxiety about the intensity of the come ups in this type of condition.


But these two trips I have had this week massively resolved this. I'm really very comfortable about the idea of taking acid now and knowing what dose and being confident at pretty much all levels I'm looking really forward to taking bigger doses to start with and exploring more powerful and deeper visual and general effects which I feel much more ready for all of a sudden.        


I'm really excited about exploring the different dosages and experiences now especially the higher ones because I'm extremely confident about being comfortable with the experience and the intensity like I did used to be.


I know now that I can cope with all aspects of the experience even with my heakth ussues and allergies.  I can keep my mind together solidly now I'm sure of it I always could in the past and I've tapped back into this in a mental strength and assurance.


And I'm also very confident that I can be physically comfortable in my body throughout the experience and my anxiety about physical effects like gastrointestinal and respiratory have been completely quelled for now, and in the moment I have proved that I can completely release all fear and anxiety about this which could work on the psychosomatic level.


I can also tolerate and manage the allergy type respiratory symptoms without it being a deterrence or spoiling experience at all which is very pleasing and I've proved that this week as well. 


So I've got so much more optimism and excitement and less apprehension about the whole thing now which is amazing because it was the other way round before.


I'm feeling heavily fatigued today, it's been a really difficult week I'm still in excruciating agony with the cracked ribs in the centre of my sternum it's really painful to breathe and I can't cough it all which makes managing my infections and allergies a nightmare at present but I'm doing an astonishing job at staying on top of all of my conditions with all my energy and focus just about to get around the house and through the necessary routines. 


I had a benefits medical assessment on Tuesday, really long stressful day travelling with my mum to a nearby town. We had a long way to walk from the car park and every step was killing my chest and back and I could hardly breathe in the whole time because of the pain.


So that was partly why I checked again on Tuesday night and yesterday morning because the first trip I had a really positive after day but this stressful and physically paying for the experience on Tuesday was interfering with with the work I wanted to do.


The follow-up trip yesterday it was really very nice and just spot on for my needs. 


I feel wasted today from the acids and very satisfied that I don't need anymore for now. I want to get back on the microdosing again now that I'm feeling it could be more positive about the whole experience and situation and future experiences.


I do get a mental comedown from acid. Like a few dats of high fatigue, slightly higher anxiety, irritability at times, a kind of emotional vulnerability.


And like today a slow and stupid brain but a very relaxed one in many ways at the same time.


But then after this passes in 1 or 2 days I suddenly feel remarkably cheered up and positive and stronger and solid. 


I'm sure there is the whole physical and mental fattigue aspect but also I have felt that some of this is gcd amount of processing and releasing going on in our subconscious and unconscious immediately following the trip which will automatically unfold and be processed over time I'm but there's probably a bit of a wait on the consciousness and psyche returning to baseline.


Those are my feelings anyway. But right now I feel like I always have in the past after pretty heavy Lsd use/trips. It's a great feeling for me, because it's something I really needed and wanted to do and experience.

I never told my mum I took any trips this week, despite the fact Im at home vast majority of time. I only just thought about this. I just disclose when it feels right, or is necessary.

I don't always tell people I'm with that I'm tripping, it's just not really necessary, and unless you're specifically trying to hide it from them, then I really don't think there's anything wrong with that.  It's your business, it's just not need to know information.


I also will often trip in bursts, like for example at music festivals, I'll trip 2 or occasionally 3 days in a row.  And then not for a while.  I just mean if you chronically do that, it really fucks with your long-term tolerance and prevents you from really getting much out of psychedelics.

I have always been able to get what I want out of acid before it loses its effectiveness for too long.  Just not going too overboard for too long is the key.


It is a shame that macrodosing may put microdosing off the table for a while.


I am looking really forward now to bigger initial doses, once tolerance is good again.

Like 250ug 1cP I think would be good. Im suddenly really up for almost losing my mind on acid lol, right on that edge. Feeling alive and exhilarated.


I read about you developing long term tolerance and I definitely want to avoid that given that weed and acid of virtually any drugs I can actually take in relative comfort.

I've taken the plunge and bought myself some 1c. I haven't taken lsd since 94 and that was a black star Microdot from Amsterdam,but back in 89 I took lots of lsd,more or less every weekend for a year.


Purple ohms were my favourite followed by strawberries,red stars,batman and jokers,pink microdots,ying hangs,smileys etc etc. I was only 14 at the time and really didn't have any cares in the world,no worries at all except where to get my next trip or bit of hash and for this reason believe that made the experience of tripping to be one of pure joy and wonder.


It was only when I left school and started out in the adult world did I have bad trips,as we all know that psychedelics heighten our mental states,if you have fears or worries these get magnified a 100 fold and we tend to internalise and suddenly see the world as a scary place.


I used to love mushrooms too. I started picking liberty caps when I was at college at 17 and preferred them over lsd. Theres been a gap of some 18 years from when I stopped and started again (I don't include arylcyclohexamines,these are not classic psychedelics.)This time round I've been using psychedelics in a healing capacity rather than recreational and have learned a lot. I started growing Cubensis and while  they're ok in low doses if I go over 3 grams I get physical discomfort and put this down to a hightening of my senses to the physical addiction that I have to opiates,but it seems that many reports of cubensis and especially wood loving psilocybes produces muscle aches. I never got this from liberty's,so my healing with cubes has not been that deep.


I shall be embarking on a Ibogaine hcl journey to free myself from the physical addiction to opiates in the near future and wish to prepare myself as best as possible and this is why I've decided to use some 1c in the meantime. I incorporate some shamanic practices into my journey's and wondered if anyone else here has done that with this compound? Many people I know who practice shamanism will only use natural plant medicine and frown on synthetics,but for me I see synthetics to have been naturally created by humans who have been created by the creator.


Anyway I ramble on. Its been great reading your reports and will be adding to it soon. Keep up the good work fellow psychonauts.


Peace.

Phoenix

Well great day guys. As mentioned, I have the most extreme anxiety disorder and worry incessantly about all things when my anxiety is active which has been most days for a long time.


This anxiety does not exclude ordering clearnet lysergamides and waiting for them to arrive in the post from abroad especially without tracking and especially for fairly large orders.


So my 250 tabs of 1cP-LSD, shipped from Amsterdam last Tuesday but still not having showed before I went to bed last night, Thursday evening, has been causing me quite some anxiety as the week has gone because I really was hoping it would just arrived this week and put my mind at rest, instill my faith in these new almost too good to be true Dutch retailers, and the postal service and shipping method etc.


I just really wanted this off my mind before the weekend because if it didn't come this week then I would be be doubly anxious about losing my money and trips not about legal repercussions.


Anyway...I was just praying it would show up today and put my mind at rest.

And it did! I got out of bed for the toilet at about 11:30 a.m. knowing the postman may have been and without my glasses on I saw a big white envelope thing on the stairs which looked like it could be the one.


And sure enough it was to my Delight and very professionally packaged 250 tabs split into 5 bags of 50 marked and labelled, and everything sealed twice in airtight vacuum packages, inside a sturdy cardboard envelope.


So I don't even need to cut them which is a bonus because I'm very rubbish at that lol! 


[@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) easy man. One of the best bits too- I didn't even need to ask for a custom sheet they have sent me the blank tabs! No markings, no ink. Batch 01.


Great setup anyway, from start to finish. I hope to make another acquisition while the opportunity remains. Im looking forward to 250ug initual doses, which may become my standard sweetspot now that I am so much more comfortable and confident and secure about tripping in any situation on any dose like my old self.


So the micropellets interest me as they are actually equally priced as blotters, per ug for 100 of each I just realised. I enjoyed the 1plsd micropellet on Wednesday.


Woah, what a week. Cracked ribs on top of chronic illness, stressful medical assessment, barely any sleep, and plenty of tripping, with tons edibles, vapor, some kava and even a spontaneous nutmeg dose last night due to anxiety and cravings for intoxication!


Has been interesting the nutmeg this morning. It definitely works psychactively I've taken it before in much higher doses I just took 7 grams last night, 2 nuts. But with some weed earlier, I did actually have quite a mad little buzz going on which synergised really well with my acid afterglow.


Anyway to end this crazy week, what a nice relief that my order came in and I can now just rest and recover over the weekend and and look forward.

Hey there, that's all really interesting and exactly what I like to hear it's always refreshing to get such an open and honest insights into others lives and experience.


It sounds really positive and encouraging and optimistic what you were doing and how you clearly have realised that you are empowered to explore options and improve things with nothing to lose and this is a very important and valuable realisation.


That belief to create and release and let go is so important and once you realise it is there to be had and have the tools at hand to effectively ease into the process and feel benefit as you go along, is really very amazing and very empowering like I say.


So I empathize with your thoughts about the shamans and how they may scorn on anything synthetic and I also agree with your feelings and expressions about acid in particular or LSD and its homologues because it is so close to nature in so many ways that I have always considered it just about acceptable and still very worthy although we just can't call it a plant medicine of course.


But then at the same time I would argue a strong case that it has as benefits and uses and applications which are very worthwhile and can help in many situations almost better than plant medicines for some people like myself I can tolerate LSD and the homologues much better than I thought but I am unable to tolerate any plant medicines that I know of except cannabis just about.


I doubt I could use Ayahuasca in any form and even mushrooms I would be extremely surprised if I could tolerate even at microdosing level but I will try them soon.


The Lsd & Co especially the purity and guarantee of the clearnet tabs, is an amazing lifeline to me personally with my allergies and health complications and is enabling me to to explore as a psychonaut safely and comfortably and also do do excellent work at healing and releasing and creating a better reality and mindset in such a difficult life.


So, [@Phoenix_rising](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/166110/) you can tell those shamans that from me haha I will stand up in court and defend the legitimacy and value of LSD as a useful tool and even a medicine for the consciousness, life and soul, when used appropiately and for right and healthy reasons.


So good luck with your own work, Im sure 1cP will be interesting and enjoyable at the least. I have felt so much freer, calmer and clearer from this week, despite extreme pain and exhaustion and stress.


I hope to hear more from you on all of this best of luck man.

Can't wait to research this one again. Just waiting to see if the micropellet version is made available. It seems to be the case in some areas so I guess it's a question of time. Anyone got to try the micro-pellet 1cp ? At 150 ug it would be like the perfect sweet spot dosage wise. It was already pretty damn close  to that with 1p.

Nice one and thank you for the encouragement. Its good to be able to express oneself to like minded travellers.


What works for one might not work for another,its all the same though,the end results are the same it's just how we dress it up and get there. Saying that though,the south American shamanic culture has been practicing with psychedelics for millennia and know exactly how to get the best out of a trip,to navigate the unseen realms and to release the healing powers locked inside ourselves and others.


Whereas our western culture is limited in this respect,yes our ancestors undoubtedly used psychedelics like mushrooms,hemlock,henbane and belladonna. There was a culture of healers who used ancient crafts,but alas the Christians put them to the stake believing it was the devils work,how ironic. Our psychdelic culture has been more or less lost and then reinvented for modern times. Allister crowley being one of the revivalists with his own interpretations,but it's just that,interpretations and assumptions of a lost art. The south American culture has stayed intact and continues to this day,so there are definitely things we can learn and then reapply to fuse with our ways...Its all a state of mind after all.


If one can achieve the same results using either a plant created by mother nature or (pacha mamma) as they would say or a synthetic compound created by humans,isnt that the point? After all isn't the lab created product just the essence of the plant in many cases. They would argue that the plant is a living thing and you need to consume the whole body as a sacrament to use its spirit as an ally. I would say a prayer to the plant and remove its spirit from the body to ingest as an ally and leave the body behind,even cremate the body as an offering or is that just being silly? I think you get my point.


Sometimes it just all goes too far. It's all about respect,intention and doing your best with integrity with whatever you use. It's like religions,the core of them all are the same,they just wear different clothes,but they'll all swear theirs is the only way and the right way.


We'll all get there eventually if we don't destroy the planet and ourselves in the process. Its really about awakening our true selves to the ultimate reality,that we are a reflection of the universe,the infinite,the ineffable. Its about raising the vibration,evolving and coming home to ourselves,we journey to find the truths.


Peace out brothers and sisters

(Be who you're meant to be,be who you are)

Only 2 weeks from my last seretonergic trip - on Halloween.

Looking to sit down with 300 ug of this tomorrow morning. As 200 ug last time wasnt as deep as Id like (which is on par with my other lysergamide trials)

Plan is for the first introspective setting in a number of months.

Hello tired of the crap (aren't we all?)


Have you taken LSD-25 before? Its just I thought 1c is supposed to be on par if not stronger and 200 mics of Lucy is a good dose,unless you're a hardcore tripper with a tolerance.


300 mics would be ego shattering to say the least,unless 1c is weaker than lucy. That being said I've seen on one vendors site saying "waterproof molecules" and another saying "1c-p-lsd does not break down into lsd when in contact with moisture/water."


Are they really trying to say that it does? Anyway I transgress. Have an amazing experience and post it here to contribute to this beautiful forum.


Peace out and shine on.

Ha - no ones ever really asked about the name but Ill explain anyway...

It started as a pill reports log in like 10 yrs ago. I was tired of the crap I was getting and bought a reagent kit

To keep things simple I kept it the same across multiple forums


Ive tripped many times on LSD but it was years ago. And I never had an elhrichs to test it like I do now.

My most recent stuff from a festival in 2010 only indicates indole (turns purple) after a number of minutes which leads me to believe the douche taco selling "blue juice" as mushroom ext when it was really 4 aco dmt and food colouring was also selling various lysergamides as lsd ... I mean now I see it as "the expensive stuff is good L" might have meant something else than face value lol 


Now I digress lol... 

Recently I found the new lysergamides, and; 200 ug 1cP-LSD previously was only a mild trip though I had tripped a number of times in the weeks leading up to it. 200 ug 1a-lsd (ald 52) is a modest trip and Ive taken that on 3 separate occasions with varying levels of tolerance. 300 ug of 1P-LSD kicked my ass... Ive still to write a Trip report for it ... it was a hilarious afternoon with an old friend who wasnt trying it.. While 200 ug of ETH-LAD was pleasantly strong but not unmanageable.... Both experiences with tolerance from trips within at least a week if not from tripping for a few weeks before


Vendor is legit and theres no obvious signs of degredation (colourization) on the 1cp

Though the ald 52 is slightly gray/blue on one side. And one batch of the eth-lad is slightly brown on one side (all on white paper with molecule name and picture - though 1 cp is all white with no writing/pic)


So I believe its a combination of natural tolerance/hard headedness as well as my current state of lysergamide tolerance 

[@Xorkoth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/77889/) has mentioned a specific tolerance to lysergamides which has since waned and Im hoping proper storage and time will allow my tolerance to decrease whilst preserving the tabs proper for some time.


Anyways chores and various today in preperation and then Ill eat it first thing tomorrow morning

Thanks for the thoughts/kind words

Have a great and thoroughly enjoyable trip and hopefully more fulfilling.


What you say about the 1cp not feeling as deep as LSD I have heard a few others express this but not necessarily in a negative light and I think it could be seen as a useful characteristic whereby it could possibly make it's an easier tool to work with in some situations or for some people without distraction and detour.


But then I am like yourself not having taken actual LSD itself for many years so it is impossible for us really to make accurate and fair comparisons because so much in our lives and Minds and bodies has changed since then for a staff that even the same LSD would feel and be experienced differently now.


I have 5 legit Californian Sunshine blotters, 25 blocks with the yellow border, lots of yellow, blue, orange and some black.  Not the orange sun on white background.


I was told they are 250 ug from a trusted source but I expect them to be around to 220 ug which is what they were commonly showing up as on ecstasydata during that time.


At some point I will be able to make a fairer comparison after I have accrued significantly more experience with these clearnets.


And I still have my ALD 52 to try. 2 tabs have been sitting in my bedroom drawer for months, removed from the others in the fridge on standby for any spontaneous moment.


But 1cP was always next in line testing. Ald for another day. Plus my sole 1plsd micro pellet I grabbed from the Germans for an allergy trial. (Which finally took place this week after it was sitting alone on top of my wardrobe for several months)


Guess what guys? The Germans ARE taking bank transfer again now! Must have changed banks. Oh well, they did me a favour. Even with £40 less returned to me than I paid out I still save money and had a great experience with the Dutch and got my buy ink free blotters as well on top.


So tonight, me being me. Sleep deprivation taunts me all day. I struggle how to control my anxiety as a result of my ridiculous tiredness. Which Spurs me to do things spontaneously and not always thoroughly thought out.


So feeling very tired tonight, and consequently too anxious to relax in order to eat food which is vital for me right now, I spontaneously took another microdosing of 15 ug of 1plsd.


Anyway, I actually felt it working almost immediately. It seems to be working well as a microdose, despite only 3 days ago, 8am Wedsnesday, I took 200ug, 645 ug total Saturday to Wednesday.


I wasn't sure whether I would even consciously feel tonight's microdose but it feels pretty much the same as the previous microdoses leading up to this week.


I mean, my tolerance hasn't stopped me registering 15ug, and feeling a very beneficial, calming and soothing effect as well.


I didn't like the idea of having to wait weeks to resume microdosing for it to be effective enough, and just to allow tolerance to reset.


But I honestly think I can just revert back into microdosing without needing to wait for it to continue to be effective.


If this is in fact the case then I also should not be at risk of messing my tolerance up too quickly. If that was so close to happening then surely I would not be observing such positive effects from this microdose, so soon after 2 full trips?


Maybe there is a way to navigate this field without having to make the level of sacrifices I anticipated and expected to be required trying to get the best out of both worlds. I guess time will tell.

I've been doing every other day ~25 ~40 mics for 2 weeks and tolerance has set in, I have to skip 2 or 3 days now to reset my mini-dose tolerance. they started to feel like microdoses.

Yes that doesn't surprise me at all. I'm sure there  is a formula and a fairly definitive line to be drawn somewhere.


My initial understanding and intention was that every 4 days was optimum for numerous reasons not least of all keeping tolerance at bay.


However I did feel during my first two weeks of microdosing that on the evening of my third day off, I really felt as though I was ready for the next microdosing and actually needed it sooner than waiting another day.


So Im thinking every 3 days might work also. Some people actually swear by 3 days and others by 4, so it could come down to the individual situation or there may simply be merits either way.


But every 2 days, regardless of dosage I don't think would be viable and sustainably effective for very long.


And those are also quite high dosages you are talking about which are certainly more than microdoses by definition.


My 15 microgram dose last night worked very effectively on my consciousness I could feel it all night and today day my mum and I went to look at a potential pet dog, I vaped a little Durban poison on the way there and I was in a post trip psychedelic headspace from the microdose last night.


So I'm quite surprised that the 15 ug still had such an all round affect just days after 2 larger macrodoses.


When it comes to my cannabis usage and tolerance I have observed that it really doesn't take long to reset and reduce tolerance just a few days of using considerably less or going longer into the day without using any, is enough to significantly reduce my tolerance and and give me a much better high from less.


I'm also starting to think that with the microdosing for example you can actually resume it at a proper microdosing level after just a few days off and you may still be able to pick up where you left off.


So in your shoes now [@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) I would leave it off for 3 days minimum if you can. Then stick to smaller doses, with at least 2 days off in between each days and I imagine that would be much more sustainable without tolerance setting in and even if it did it would be easy to take an extra day off or just skip a dose to get back on track I imagine.


I would recommend 15 ug as a maximum because I already had in my mind the impression that much about this this will possibly interfere with tolerance and also is getting a bit high to work in the way of true microdose is intended.


I have taken 10 ug doses, 12.5ug, 25ug, but 15ug last night actually felt spot on in that it gave me energy and stimulation, I was very considerate and introspective for the rest of the night and I was observing how the substance was working on my consciousness and the default mode network, and how I was detached and freed or separated from this and able to just work on a different level mentally and see things from a slightly different angle consciously and subconsciously.


And I have felt as though I have had some acid today, in an uplifting and positive,  refreshed sense.


Looking really forward to dropping 250-300ug 1cP next trip with luck. Just a week ago I would have been nervous and apprehensive at the prospect but now it's just excitement and confidence and knowing that I will be able to handle anything that comes my way.


Even if that is not the case and I set myself up for a little humbling just going into things with that belief so firmly cemented in my mind and makes all the difference and actually being a little arrogant can pay off because it's probably better to be slightly overconfident than an unnecessarily anxious.


Cannabis edibles now! Enjoy your Sunday's everybody, and your trips. ☺

So is everyone just throwing whatever anhydrides/acid chlorides they were using for fentalogue production and banging them on LSD and calling it a RC?


Has it not been proven these are individually mostly just prodrugs for good old LSD25 and have little activity at 5HT2R alone?


When do we get butyryl-LSD? pentanoyl-LSD? THCA-LSD? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Also... cyclopropionyl? First I ever heard of that, wouldn't it be more correctly cyclopropanecarboxylate?

Well I'm not impressed. I took 150mics at 1.00pm that was 2 hrs ago,its much,much weaker than LSD,what I'm feeling now,and I have no tolerance issues would be the equivalent to a quarter of a good old lucy tab back in the 90s. To get anything like the acid back then youd have to injest 4 to 5 of these tabs at least.


The fact that I'm typing this now is testament. If I'd had half an old lsd tab I wouldn't be able to write or even think of writing.


I'm telling you like it is. I have no agenda.


They're either scared of people tripping these days or they're just out to make a buck? You decide.

by mass, 1CP-LSD should be equivalent to about 80% of its weight in LSD, so a 150ug 1CP tab is equivalent to a 120ug LSD tab


but then again as an amide prodrug I'd expect it to be less potent than LSD

It also has a lot of hypothermia and muscle spasms,so much so that it colours the experience. Or maybe I'm just getting old.

Well, I took half a tab 1 hour ago just to confirm that my recent batch was properly dosed and I am surprised at the strength of the effects for just 50ug.


I have taken lots of LSD 25 myself in the past at very high dosages and I am personally quite satisfied with the potency and effectiveness of 1p LSD and 1cp LSD.


But maybe I am just a lightweight these days or simply I'm happy with whatever depth and level experience I get.


[@Phoenix_rising](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/166110/) I really don't know what to make of your experience perhaps it will develop into a fuller one I hope. Do you use cannabis? I am a bit of a cannabis addict and always use weed with my trips so this will be a factor.

1cP is definitely stronger than 1plsd, ug for ug.  I thought 1plsd was 83% equivalent to Lsd. Not disputing or critiquing what you are saying here just simply adding this.


Edit- I had absolutely zero intentions of microdosing today or taking any acids, it was only because somebody messaged me via YouTube who I have referred to these new Dutch suppliers and he just received his own supply of tabs this morning from them but he contacted me saying he took one and didn't notice any effect and took another one a few hours later and got subtle effects that was very disappointed.


However he has 1plsd and not the same batch as myself but I did think I wanted to make absolutely sure that my tabs were fully dazed rather than let any anxieties build in the back of my mind, also I have been referring the vendors to so many people.


So I was barely in the mood and the 50ug has hit me much stronger than I expected. I am pretty sure if I had dropped 200ug I would be feeling quite an intense and Powerful come up and trips right now no question.


I must be a light way or there is something different about how my brain and body processes and uses these lysergamides.

It's a very clean and clear buzz though. Maybe it doesn't hit as hard but thinking it's all in the dosing. Three of these are like a good lucy trip. This is a good alternative.

I was harsh on this compound. It is powerful but could be more like 200mcg rather than 100mcg. Be warned it's a creeper.

I had a similar experience when I took 200 ug. The fact that I was keeping a journal not experiencing it first hand was a sign I didnt take enough / couldnt let go. I think this has a lot to do with individual metabolisms, as such the fact that some ppl find 1P indistinguishable from lsd (same for 4 aco dmt to 4 ho/po dmt).


I too had a lot of muscle soreness, though I was unsure if it was because I just started exercising again or what. I spend the first bit of the trip stretching - and it felt amazing lol...But I had a lot less issues regulating body temp with 1cp than 1P (mind IVe only experienced each once lol).


I was unable to get to try this again on the weekend but rest assured I will asap.

300 ug of 1P was so immersive though much different than LSD (which is fine -if I wanted LSD Id just take LSD lol). 

So Ill jump from 200 to 300 of this stuff and report back

Interesting. I already have abnormal and messed up body temperature regulation from my lyme disease and when I took 1plsd, many times I just couldn't get comfortable and draw the line between being freezing cold and having so many layers on that I was sweating and too hot.


And I realise now that I have been a lot more comfortable with the 1cp LSD in this respect so far, maintaining a more comfortable balance.


I was looking forward to your trip report on it but will continue to do so.


Guys I quite rate this 1cP. I'm genuinely amazed at the effect and fullness of the experience I have had today I'm just 50 micrograms which was only to test the batch.


It is definitely more Potent than 1plsd me this 50 ug dose feels almost on par with 100 ug of 1plsd. I had no intentions of any dosing today. This has been a full enough trip. Substantial colour enhancement and general perceptive effects. Powerful physically. 


Provoking and insightful. Which is amazing because all the talk and preaching we hear about tolerance, I should not have been able to trip like this today after my recent consumption.


I'm really glad I took this dose today. It has shown me how clean and potent this compound is for such a remarkably low dose to give such a significant and worthwhile experience.  And I know my tabs are good, and no regrets getting 1cP over 1plsd!


Incidentally, the guy who I linked up on YouTube I got back to me and turns out he was tripping pretty hard in the end on the 1plsd, he just never gave it time.

LSD and analogues can creep up on you sometimes. No consistency in it for me, I've had it hit me hard after 20-30 minutes, and take over 2 hours to really be tripping. 

When it creeps up it's deceitful, I've seen people claiming they didn't feel anything yet while I could notice the LSD was altering their thoughts.


Is this other people's experience too?

I personally find acid takes a good 2 hours to really make itself manifest. Sure you get some notice as early as 20 mins, but it's a slow burner.

This waa generally my experience with Lsd. And this is where 1plsd differs most of all in my experiences so far. Much faster more intense and abrupt comeup.


1cP seems less so I think, more gradual.

The trip took so long to manifest into full effect. It has been over 20 years since I had LSD so maybe I was remembering things differently about those trips,but 1c-p-lsd still isn't as strong as those back in the 90s.


It wasn't as colourful IMO and not as morphing. I don't want to sound like I'm bashing it though as it was beautiful in it's own respect,half of my problem was sitting indoors. As soon as I took the dog out into the fields it shone and revealed itself as a noteworthy psychedelic,the sky was amazing.


I think if you took 200 mics this would be closer to the real thing. It was an uncomfortable come up though, the cat came and sat on my lap. I was very cold even though the heating was on,but I had uncontrollable tremors,the cat hung on but was like he was sitting on a pneumatic drill.


I went down the garden and lit a fire and had music on and it was good watching the flames,god knows what the neighbours think,but who cares. I'm usually very quiet.


By 9.00pm I'd had enough. I'd taken half an flualprozolam when I was cold and shaking earlier and thought I'd have an early night. But curiosity got the better of me with 75mg of MXPr I had and I plugged it and got into bed. Usually with MXE I feel it in minutes,this one took longer,but when it did arrive I felt that MXE feeling again and smiled,like meeting an old friend again.


Then it took and wrong turn into a place I've been before on arylcyclohexylamines. I went into the bathroom and everything looked tiny,miniature toilet,bath and shower by the time I made it back to the bedroom everything was disappearing,when I looked at any object it had black around the edges like soot. I had this thought/feeling that I'd cracked this reality. I'd seen through the creators plan of this plane of existence and the creator was pissed at me for seeing through it all so was taking it all away. That's when I panicked and was trying to get this reality back I even thought about going out into the street to see if it was still there,but something told me not to.


I found my way to the book shelf in the living room with the dream interpretation book where I'd hidden my flualprozolam and knew if I took some of these that I'd go to sleep and in the morning reality would be back,but it really felt like creator was saying "not this time buddy,you keep breaking through/in your lessons over."


I ended up eating 3 1/2 flualprozolam and woke up this morning at 11 and missing an appointment. Today I've felt very withdrawn and quite depressed. I hope my iboga experience will be different,but then I'm going to be taking iboga for a completely different reason.


Peace out and shine on.

Phoenix

I find it is the exact opposite for me. 1p takes forever to kick in like I feel absolutely nothing for like 1,5-2 hours then bam it all comes on at once. This tricked me once after taking 2 blotters and not feeling much after 2 hours I figured it was a weak batch or something and took 2 more. Than I lit a joint and the four doses all hit me in an instant. I suddenly did not recognize my own appartment and barely understood where I was. Was a bit overwhelming at first. Then I saw de souce code of reality. It was like everything I was perceiving from my environement was felt as a mathematical formula. I was a mathematical formula. 1cP comes on much quicker and smoother and as far as I can remember LSD also came on pretty fast.

[@Phoenix_rising](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/166110/) thanks very much from all of us for elaborating with a really interesting and insightful trip report.


So I got a little confused by your posts yesterday and I David the impression that you have taken 3 tabs altogether after initially being disappointed with effects.


But from other, and today's post, it sounds like you just took the one tab at 100ug?


If so maybe your comparison to LSD isnt totally accurate, seeing as I believe 1cP-lsd may be similar to 1plsd in that it has a different molecular weight so that 100 micrograms is equivalent to something like 83 micrograms of LSD.


One tab of homologues is a slight under dose for most people in my opinion. And it's all in the dose with acid of course.


Im pretty sure your 90's tabs would have been well over 100 ug of LSD. More like 150-200 most likely. So it would be very misleading to compare one tab to one tab, that's the point I'm making.


Importantly though sorry to hear that you had a negative turn to your experience and I can relate to your feeling withdrawn and not so positive today but hold encouragement because I have have experienced this myself earlier this year when I first tried these lysergamides and I think this can just be a natural part of the healing process after a trip where it can feel like we have not benefited or gained and are downcast and sensitive or upset or confused.


And this will pass naturally and the benefits will reveal themselves more positively over time.


[@babooon87](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/119267/) really interesting that and I do believe from what I have heard the individual metabolisms may cause different experiences with 1plsd such as the speed of the come up.


A lot of people have the exact same experience as myself with 1p, an unquestionably faster and more abrupt come up. I personally prefer a creeper any day, less if a smack to the face . I actually like things to continue to feel normal for a while so that I can almost forget I have taken a substance when the effects come on but with 1p I barely have time to sit down and think.

If it feels right, go for it. Down that rabbit hole I'm sure there are some treasures to be be dug out and brought back to the surface.


Have a safe and enjoyable trip tonight and remember to stay positive and remind yourself that everything is on course and going in the right direction at all times.


Edit, real sorry man. I only just noticed that this was many hours ago now but I hope you've had a good night and all went well.

In fact I do find it abrupt and smack to the face but it happends long after ingestion. I take it then I feel nothing for a good hour and a half sometimes even longer. But once I do begin feeling it it goes from 0 to peak in what seems like seconds and can be a bit overwhelming/panic inducing at high doses like I described in my earlier post. (like holding my face with my hands and gasping as I am thinking : " oh my god...what have I done to myself " as I watch reality totally slipping under my feet as I look around a room covered in pixelated fractal moving textures.

The first night I must have had two blotters of 1c-p-lsd at first I took 1 1/2 at 1.00pm but then when I was going to bed I decided to take the other half of the flualprozolam before I did the MXPr,but there was the other half of the 1c-p-lsd next to it and I ate both. Then freaking out about reality disappearing I took three more flualprozolam and woke up 11.00am.


The night after I took the three remaining 1c-p-lsd,was going to do 2 but thought why save one. It didn't manifest though. I was really disappointed,was this now because I had benzos in my system? I don't think so,even with the benzos swimming about in my system and having some 1c-p-lsd the night before I still should have felt something.


I never liked 1p-lsd when it came out. Theres something about these lsd pro drugs that make them unpredictable and unstable metabolisers. It cant just be me? I've got a huge bag of shrooms and they always work guaranteed,even if taken two nights in a row,effects diminish but not to the point of being unoticable.


No more synthetics for me. I'm sticking to mother natures treasures,they always work for me.


This is my experience (unfortunately)

I would say unquestionably that the downers in your system have completely prevented the acid from working yesterday I'm pretty sure of it and it wouldn't surprise me I actually would have been quite surprised if you had had any sort of experience with it because you didn't just have the tolerance factor from the day before but the downers as  well and you probably would not have been able to enter a psychedelic headspace properly on any dose.


I mean I took myself only 50ug the other day and I had a really surprisingly worthwhile and fairly strong trip which was in many ways more productive and insightful than a microdose and a full macrodose.


I would never normally consider a dosage like that but I'm very glad I experienced it because it showed me how potent this compound can be when uninterrupted and allowed to work.


So Im sure that was the case for you yesterday.


And I say again, maybe your initial trip would have been much better if you had had a larger dose to start with placing it more on par with your original LSD experiences which probably were up to 300 ug and above on occasions I have no doubt.


And also it sounds like your first night with the 1cp LSD was somewhat choppy especially with the additional substances which could have taken away the potential clarity and benefit you may have experienced as the trip went on.


I do find personally that trips can work in stages at times and especially when we have work to do in our psyche and towards the latter end of the trip it can really come into itself like an open clearing where we can suddenly feel so much refreshment and rejuvenation.


So I would suggest that possibly your first night this didn't have a chance to happen and maybe be you just weren't properly prepared at this time for the type of experience you might have gained more benefit from.


But nothing lost everything is on course like I say and I expect there will be some benefits in your subconscious and psyche because you just can't escape the action of the psychedelics they will always do something productive even if it doesn't feel like it and it can take some time, in the pipeline I like to say.


But by all means my friend follow the path you feel is best for you and the best of luck with your natural route and the Ibogaine.


I hope to hear some positive updates from you in future I will be keeping a lookout wishing you all the best.

[@Phoenix_rising](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/166110/) Id wager it was a combination of tolerance and benzos in your system as to why you didnt trip 2 nights in a row. Esp due to flualprozolam  long duration.


As Ive only had one experience of each 1P and 1cP and at different doses (300 vs 200)... more trials needed.. take what follows witha grain of salt:


For the above experiences I found 1cP to be more flowly and visual (though not very but then again Im not so inclined for oev with many substances Ive tried) with a longer gradual come up though less headspace. Id wager I just wasnt fully engaged because it was slightly an underdose for me and I think increasing the dose should suffice to get a better appreciation for this one. 


While the 1P trip came on hard and had that faced paced LSD mindset (for me) but lacked a lot of the oev Id associate with LSD..I was fully locked in though and it took me for a trip. For a solid 2 hrs (though time was irrelevant) I wasunder its spell lol.... My trip report is becoming longer than I expected but I feel it deserves the time, given

Gosh I stitched myself up a bit today guys. I have had a tough few weeks with a cracked sternummand injured cadtillage and it has put me in quite a condition not beaing able to breathe and relax, sleep etc. So I have eneded up being very flexiblenwith my tripping doses to get through it. 


It all started yesterday afternoon with a spontaneous 50ug /half tab of 1cP-Lsd.


I came up on it surprisingly strongly in combination with some cannabis edibles and supplemental vapor into the evening I was very high and needed no more.


The trouble was I had a dentist appointment today at 3:50 pm so I didn't really want to be up all night tripping ideally.


But I redosed at 7.30 pm last night, 25ug just to add legs. More cannabis edibles and many hours later (oh yes, and a spontaneous 0.5mg Etizolam, which didn't though or kill the trip at all)...3.15 am in fact. I took 125ug more of the acid.


Vaping some potent Sativa Durban the 125ug hit me hard again, but was scintillating and exhilarating.


I was very cained. Tripping, stoned, tired, exhausted. I slept for a little while. I was too cold to keep trying to get back to sleep each time I woke up. So I got up, dropped another 50ug, made tea, decided to add ANOTHER 50ug.


Ready for a shower, already coming up noticeably, I decided to take the other half tab I snipped off. Then another half tab as soon as I was washed, before I even dressed in fact.


This all took place today between 9:15 and 10:15 a.m. I thought I would have time to come up and settle before my dentist appointment and I never expected to come up that hard after the day since I had yesterday day and early this morning and in recent weeks.


But I also miscalculated how many I had taken I kept losing track of it and getting muddled as the acid was hitting me and having to back step.


In my mind I thought I had taken 3.5 tabs in total since yesterday afternoon but actually I figured it was 4.


Now, I'm sure in my subconscious I had calculated I would just about be able to get away with 3 1/2 tabs worth and cope with today and my dentist appointment...


I had vaporized a fair amount of weed earlier this morning, not expecting to take the load more acid.


At 11:30 am I made a strong cup of cannabis edible tea thinking that would not hit me and enhance the acid too much. I really didn't know if I would get any sort of strong noticeable come up from the two tabs today.


A couple of hours later and a short while ago boy was I suddenly tripping ever so hard. Like, on the edge of a panic attack sudden coming up intentionally on acid.


The Edible tea really kicked it up hard much more than I expected and I was having a panic attack about not having time to try and eat some breakfast which was going to be difficult as hell anyway tripping this hard add and get to the dentist in time.


I was coming up harder and harder and there wasn't long before my appointment and I was in a real panic about not being able to eat some breakfast giving myself indigestion because I was tripping waiting much to eat but I desperately need some food and energy.


My mum also wanted me to go to the tip with her on the way and take a load of garden stuff there so it was extra anxiety about leaving early.


But then I could have saved myself this whole palaver and distress because my mum was held up up due to a road blockage and phoned me saying we weren't going to make it to the dentist in time.


So I had to wait in the phone queue for 15 agonising minutes to completely and officially confirmed that I would not be going to the dentist this afternoon by cancelling the appointment.


So I was saved by the bell. But caught heavily offguard by the acid.

400ug of 1cP-Lsd was getting the better of me. It was very loomy, no getting away from it. I was considering vaping some more Durban Poison after my cannabis tea, which I never thought was going to hit me too strongly.


Thank goodness I didn't vaporize anymore weed I think that would have been too much on the come up. Strong stuff this 1cP with good weed. Very nice clean and strong warm physical glowing feeling. I just wish I could have saved myself the major anxiety attack about the appointment and going out at a certain time and I may have had a really fantastic trip.

So, really, all in all I have to say I am feeling really fine, except for indigestion which is a daily issue for me due to extreme anxiety which is strongly related to my physical problems actually eating due to allergies and respiratory symptoms.


So apart from digestive discomfort I really do feel remarkably well considering all things.


But this trip would have been so much more superb without the anxiety of today so I'm trying to get things back on track now into a purely positive swing.


With tab number 5! It may put me back on edge again, we'll see. I'm about to vaporize some more Durban poison my first vape since early this morning.


Wish me luck guys! Im hoping this binging will quell my cravings for a while. I am confident about beong able to simply keep tripping until I have less desire to do so, which will likely happen before or at the same time as tolerance becomes too much of a factor..


It has always been this way for me with tripping I have never stressed about how I approach it and how frequently will how much I just take it flexibly according to my desires and situational requirements without feeling there is anything to lose it all go wrong for sacrifice and when I've had enough I just leave it for a little while and I'm good to go again.


Renewable is what I like about the psychedelic experience and keeping it fresh always in your mind and imagination and consciousness.

So what do you guys think? There is a loose diagnal half tab in the bag with the others. Should I just drop that as well on top of tab 5 I just ate? I'm thinking it mjht be worth it. The intensity of the comeup and prolongued peak has eased off, but ready to be pushed up again.


Just vaping some lovely Durban. I feel I may as well get the most out of the trip, which can mean teetering on the edge at times.


Tab 5.5 or not?

Yes definitely not a waste. All for experience. Peak has levelled out now but still tripping for sure. It comes and goes in waves with a heavier trip. I started thinking I was straight earlier before I realised I was still tripping my head off lol!


The trip itself is fine. With the 1cP, it transists from the effects into a really comfy bodily high and warm feeling and afterglow, no comedown and I feel surprisingly healthy. 


Just not such great condition is my body atm. It was pretty good just before I injured my sternum, things have gone to pot since then.


I'm really glad, whatver comes, to have finally been able to explore my love for the deeper psychedellic experiences I swear I was destined to seek. And without fear of the drug or the experience either.


The hope is to be content soon enough to put tripping aside again and be more content with frequent breaks, or stick to a more disiplined microdosing programme.

Actually that is not correct at all 1cp LSD was tested thoroughly along with the other  lysergamides we currently know, way back in 2016 or around then.


So it was actually made and tested several years ago.


To be more accurate it was recently "released" to circumvent the new legal amendments in Germany and this is the reason it was kept back for such an occasion so it could be whipped out as a trump card at the right and inevitable moment.


I expect the same for 1blsd. No interest in that one myself. The runt of the litter by the sounds of it.


1cP I like. I had a good dose now. So that should keep me going for a while.


I will be very interested after at least several days break to see if my microdosing is and possibly even my 50 ug doses will still be effective in the same way that they were after this heavy trip. 


I have a funny feeling that 50ug will still be a very effective experience.


I started my trip 2 days ago with a 50 ug dose along with my cannabis and that in itself was a really enjoyable and sufficient trip at the time before I started adding more heavily.


6.5 tabs total. Number 6/12 was just to keep me conscious and still "up" to see the long day/night through until I had finally eaten, managed symptoms etc.


I vaped lovely weed before bed. I was drifting off into my mind's eye, on the border of unconsciousness and dream land. I was tripping in my mind in a real dream land.


It was like an actual real dream every second. I would be keeping myself conscious until I finished my vaporizing, coming in and out of this dreamland.


I often can experience this hallucinogenic fairy land with my late night cannabis vaping at the end of the day.  


But the way I was experiencing at last night was really next level and I was almost scared to shut my eyes and go to sleep because of The Madness and intensity of these dreams and images and hallucinations which was so real and each time I would shut my eyes I would have like a new new random intricate plot and experience and situation that would unfold before me.


All harmless and positive but just really random specific intricate stuff like you would dream and wake up and think- that was strange sort of thing.


As I was snapping back to full consciousness which I'm very good at resisting sleep due to the living with with constant excessive fattigue and sleep deprivation, but needing to stay conscious at certain times when it's incredibly hard to in order to digest food and manage respiratory symptoms etc.....


Let's just say I have an extraordinary willpower and Talent for actually managing to stay conscious when it is so incredibly impossible to do so......


....so each moment that I would drifts into this unconscious hallucinogenic world momentarily then snap background immediately I was having a mini psychedelic streaming experience each time even if I was only drifted off for a couple of seconds.


And as I snapped back to to with the the psychedelic imagery and and contents of the mini dream fresh in my mind I was chuckling in amusement at the bizarreness of these Concepts and experiences my mind was displaying before me.


So I slept sound eventually for about 4 hours. Just about to vaporise some more weed I expect I will have a pretty strong Afterglow and usually feel pretty off my head for several days after even a 200ug trip.


I also did definitely come up on tab 6.5 (from 5.5 lol) which was spontaneous about 12.30 am or something. I really noticed it several hours later when I was vaping before bed I was actually really tripping again with open eye visuals especially as soon as I vaporised.


So it kept the intensity and visuals and headspace of the trip going and and leads to that that amazing beautiful in and out of consciousness psychedelic dreamland hallucinogenic state I have just just slept in for the last 4 hours no doubt.


Just hit a little vapor, and I feel the acid strongly in my system immediately.

Today has been nice so far. I awoke for the final time about 2.40pm UK. But I only went to bed at about 6 am after a 650ug 1cP-Lsd bender. 


I vaporized Durban and another 2 strains at 5 am just to keep me awake a little longer to digest my late, but tasty dinner of wholewheat spaghetti, tuna, chips and saurkraut! 


I was still heavily in the trip before I vaped at 5 am, and I was instantly into a hallucinogenic wonderland, where as I do late at night with cannabis and tiredness alone, I rest between conscious and unconsciousness, in an all round hallucinogenic state, with open and closed eye visuals.


I already described above how I was slipping in and out of consciousness  early this morning hallucinating and dreaming. Well it really was just insane I was literally conscious and unconscious at the same time slipping into sleep every other second and each time I would have what seems like an entire random fully real and abstract hallucinogenic dreaming type experience I've totally random but seemingly meaningful stuff.


We know that dreams happen very quickly in real time which has always fascinated me and this was extraordinary because I was honestly snapping back to my chair and vaporizer with a fresh memory of the bizarre little psychedelic dream I just had.


And I was literally chuckling at the randomness of it each time.

So this was a very different phase of the acid experience and why I like redosing at different points because you can can enter different head spaces as you go along.


So I finally got up at 2:40 p.m. today although I awoke after a 4-hour psychedelic dream sleep of the highest quality to a little more vaporizer which brought me right back up on the acid before another restful little sleep.


I had to spend two and a half hours managing my allergy and other symptoms before I was free today, washed and ready.


I was still feeling completely hammered and off my head from both cannabis and acid much more from the acid than I anticipated. In a good way, like no way do I want/need any more for a little while. And in no bad way, just positively wrecked. This feeling I have always sought after acid/MDMA/psyches etc.


Like I've been somewhere, with souvenirs lol!


But I finally took my edible cannabis dose tonight about 7pm. It was much stronger than usual with the heavy lingering 1cP effects. Instantly feeling both drugs together I was. No need even for vaporization.


I did just vape one load of Durban. Very high still on acid and weed is something else right now. Such a pure, clean happy high though. So little downside for such a clean, long, high quality and all round deeply therapeutic experience.


I just posted this in the Morning Fix thread, but figured to paste it here as well, with elaboration. It was a great trip, full on at times, variable but warm, smooth, and with a lot of edge and some pure mania which I do love deep down.


Just what I needed and have been longing for for so long. 


But you know what, I am most looking especially forward now to getting back on my smaller doses particularly the 50ug combined with my cannabis edibles in the afternoon.

Supplemented with high quality vapour as the day goes on that has been my favourite dosage experience so far. The 1cP is very effective at that dose. It's honestly a lot better than many lsd-25 tabs I took in years gone by.

Is that the 1cP pellets? Enjoy thoroughly bro.  I was go8ngbto get 100 of those from the Dutch after I realised it was identical price as 100 blotters, ug for ug.


But after seeing the unexpected Black Friday deal, it seemed a better move to get 250 blotters, at the cheapest rate plus 20% off.  


Wow 450ug is no meager dose. I had another nice and worthwhile trip yesterday on just 50ug again and plenty of cannabis.


You're braver than me mate haha have a splendid day.

Well to be honest this is not a typical dose for me and I did not take it all at once. My tolerance just happened to be really high at the moment I received it because I had taken other psychedelics a few days earlier. I just couldn't resist trying them even if I wasted some by not waiting a week for my tolerance to come back down. It was still worthwhile and the trip was useful even if the effects were somewhat watered down and the visuals almost nonexistent. Hahaha, great compound anyway !

Thanks for explaining I can relate to that. I was a bit surprised at the dosage and apparent blashe confidence haha.

The pellets do interest me. I like the absolute minimalism of the ingredients in particular. I tried a 1plsd pellet few weeks ago together with 1cP.


I only ever bought it to test for intolerance. But it seemed fine. If the pellets were as cheap as my discounted 250, I would probably choose them.


But the paper is so handy for any old dosing schedule. 50, 25, 100, 125 etc, can all be judged pretty reliably with a careful eye and good pair of scizzors.


Anyway I'm glad you didn't have a bad trip bro. 400ug surprised me a bit with cannabis tea kicking in the previous week. 350 would have made all the difference and that is what I thought I had taken in total until I re-calculated my error when the peak with the edibles seemed a bit strong.

Depends on your experience with tripping and LSD. 100ug is probably a good first time dose. 

If you have experience with LSD you could start higher of course.

Yes difficult to answer really I mean it's basically the same as LSD with regards to dosage and expectation the only thing I would question would be duration which is hard for me to personally ascertain because of the way I redose and use cannabis always which increases the intensity and longevity of the experience and keeps the effects going in my system more intensely and for longer.


But its a take your pick thing really. I like 50ug with my herb. Very colourful, substantial exoerience where I'm still hovering in my normal mindset but able to really appreciate this beautiful tripping headspace and music is really wonderful to listen to.


100ug is a lot fuller, not too intense but with weed nice and strong.

I expect 200ug with no tolerance to feel like at least 250ug of 1plsd.

I had an incredible trip yesterday combining 1cP with dxm.


After an hour I was sick from the dxm... shoulda saw it coming because I ate it on an empty stomach and it happens every time, durp lol, anyways... so its hard to say exactly what my dose but I waited 3 hrs to judge my state, which is roughly how long I take to peak when I dose powder. Not long after I ate 300 ugs of 1cP it quickly became an incredible trip. At times difficult and others heavenly.


I experienced a wonderful catharsis

It was exactly what I needed after a 4 week tolerance break...

This one will require some serious integration though

Great news guys. My last order with the Dutch cama in today.


250 × 1cP-LSD plus 25 Etizolam blotters.


Only 3 working days to UK how sweet. No lingering anxiety into next week.

Are the Etizolams for a just-in-case scenario, or other? If former, how do you find they bring you back/down?

Well not exactly. I am so restricted in my options drug and medicine wise. I have tried numerous different options this year in a determined bid to find ways to use psychoactive substances both medically and recreationally to help me deal with anxiety and depression and an otherwise mundane yet stressful and unfulfilling way of living.


I tried kratom for example which was simply amazing for my anxiety which is the biggest problem I seek some additional drugs beside cannabis and LSD which are not exactly the right formula for the solution.


So the kratom was fantastic in that regard and for my depression also so many of my other symptoms physically my low body temperature and difficulty sleeping and general aches and pains and so many things but the kratom made me severely unwell by messing up my digestive system particularly the valves in my colon and I got dangerously ill as a result I also got a dictated in 4 weeks of quite heavy use and had to stop cold turkey and had a pretty nasty withdrawals for about 4 or 5 days as well.


I also tried kava which on paper has a much better profile with no real Downside that I am actually aware of I don't think withdrawals or physical dependence really occurs and it has so much merits and potential medicinally.


But I'm sure I got a fairly heavy strain and I really likes the stimulant uplifting effects of the kratom hence my original attraction to it it and the kava does not combine so well for cannabis whereas kratom and cannabis together is is arguably my favourite drug combination of all time for daily use.


And I experience substantial respiratory irritation and excessive mucus congestion from these herbs despite the kava at least being completely harmless for my body.


I have craved something like Valium for years which I took in the past but I just know I couldn't tolerate any of these tablets. So the etizolam blotters drew my attention as a trial because the dosage is so low like LSD ranges.


And just as pure as the LSD trips with only blotter paper and the etizolam itself.


So it was never intended as a trip abort or even compliment as such but I have been flexible with the first five trial tabs I ran through.


0.25 mg is an effective dose for me. 0.5 mg today was actually a little too heavy and not necessary. That was before I took my cannabis edibles and vaporized.


And I have found that it didn't really affect my trips recently although I have taken 200ug this evening after the 0.5 mg etizolam this afternoon and cannabis edibles and it felt like the 1cP was struggling to come through because I was in such a lethargic sedated state and tired and stoned at the same time.


But I have woken myself up and vaporizing potent sativa Durban has brought me up on the the 200 ug. A nicd buzz and headspace now that the etizolam sedation has eased.


You know I also believe that with acid it's about the experience not the dose in your bloodstream for x amount of hours etc and sometimes that experience can be postponed for some extra hours and come through later unexpectedly.

[@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) the last part i have experinced aswell just at start of nov i did some lsd and well the come up never came to a peak for a bit i wondered if the hot weather had degraded my tabs then at the four hour mark the acid really kicked in hard and had a nice extended peak the trip was still over within 12 hours. Very clean visuals of reality object morphing and super blissed out oneness that lasted 6 hours

Yeah and Ive had trips be even more prolonged than that.


One Christmas day rave 2004, I took 17 Mickey Mouse ecstasy pills, lots of ketamine and some weak acid over the night but in the morning I scored some legitimate Hoffman blotters which were pretty good.


I took two tabs and never really came up in a noticeable way but I was off my head the whole day at friends houses and then later on I met up with a friend from the past and this was at about 9 p.m. when the acid really started kicking in and took me by surprise when I had taken it at about 10 a.m..


It was like my consciousness wasn't quite ready for the experience with all those other things in the pipeline.. more MDMA was taken that night but I had a really amazing trip which kind of lasted all night until the following morning.

From what I've read, 1cP-LSD has basically the same effects as ALD-52, though maybe an hour or two shorter in duration. Anyone who has tried both and can confirm? Or has noticed any other differences?

This is not really an answer to your question at all but two days ago I visited my amazing homeopath who uses an incredibly advanced and 100% legitimate diagnostic tool but works on an energetic and frequency level called the Vega machine to diagnose with absolute pinpoint solid accuracy all sorts of infections in the body exactly where they are and what sort of an action they are having. 


it's an incredibly advanced diagnostic technology which is is accepted and and used widely in the mainstream German and Dutch medical system, but has been attacked and dishonesty demonised by the Western UK and us allopathic medical establishments who seek to to suppress it.


Anyway I have always been able to test various foods and supplements to see see how useful or irritating or beneficial they may be for my particular body or in general in a medicinal sense.


The testing has always 100-percent reflected my exact experience of the particular items I have tested, and I have learnt so much for me over the years in addition to the diagnosis and treatment I receive.


So anyway this week I had the opportunity to test numerous psychoactive compounds including three lysergamides.

I was already pretty sure that 1plsd would be indicated as the least beneficial or slightly more aggravating and this was actually the case.


Next stop was 1cp LSD which I was confident it would be better and it was noticeably better than the 1plsd although the 1plsd tested pretty ok still.


Finally was the ALD 52 which I still have not taken yet because I've been enjoying the 1cp LSD too much of late to make way for it.

I also suspected the ald-52 to test slightly better out of the three and this was actually the case it was a notice of all nuts better than the 1cp LSD which still tested very well.


I promise you all this is not factory it's an advanced diagnostic device which really should be used in all mainstream hospitals if not for the corruption we live in.


I mean don't get me wrong I'm still perfectly happy taking all three of these lysergamides will they my preference who's 1cp LSD over 1plsd and I do expect there will be more similarities between 1cp and and ald-52.


1cp definitely has a smoother more Pleasant and enjoyable come up for myself vs 1plsd which is quite abrupt and aggressive. Very many people have the same experience as well although it does appear to vary between different bodies.


So, going by my generally well honed intuition, and everything I have picked up about ALD, my 1cP and 1p experiences, and the spot on Vega testing indications in line with my gut feelings and expectations, we could probably argue that 1cp LSD I would share some of the warmer more comfortable characteristics of ald-52 which I have heard described.


Also that stands to reason about the slightly shorter duration because it has certainly sounds from most reports that ald-52 has a slightly longer duration than LSD 25 and these other clearnet homologues appear to have a slightly shorter duration in general.

I don't find they are the same. 1cp-lsd feels a bit more potent and more visual (and a bit different visuals, different color palette) but shorter duration. What is similar between the two is they are very smooth, les edgy and manic than 1p-lsd.

There is definitely a manic intensity to 1p, especially the come up it's the fastness of the experience I think as much as anything but also 1p LSD has a noticeably darker headspace than 1cp in my experience and observation.

Yes I agree 100% with that statement especially past the 300 ug mark. I once took 400 of 1p and it really caught me off guard when it came on. It had that cold mathematical feeling like everything I was percieving from my environnement were processed as mathematical formulas in my head. It was pretty weird for a few minutes until it settled and I got used to this state.

That's a really good way of putting it and I can relate entirely to that because my first 1plsd trip of only 200ug in January after a break, your description really matches my experience in terms of this sort of classroom and blackboard analytical stages of sums and breaking things down and thinking , hmmmm! 


I found myself wondering how constructive and healthy and meaningful or beneficial some of these angles of thought and calculation and perception were at the time.


Overall it was still a fantastic trip and the visual and even analytical thinking was appreciable.

No duration difference at all for me - the effects are broadly the same as each other (and indeed LSD or 1B) I wouldn't want to say there is any difference without having used both a lot and even then it would be anecdotal

Guys I had an incredibly intense trip yesterday on 1cp LSD again.


I went on a wild bender with it starting over a month ago but even with the amounts I have taken I am not having a problem getting strong and Powerful effects a little too much actually.


I barely took any significant time off after going pretty heavy for a month. Exactly 35 tabs, 3.5 mg in about 30 days.  I intended to break for a while, and microdose priperly with more discipline for a while before returning to better planned planned out and more disciplined macrodosing again.


That never happened. Very stressful home situations, combined with a coincidental emotional and physical healing crisis, I only took small doses for a week. 


25 ug, 50 ug at a time. Most days, a few days off. 50 ug wednesday night, with Kava, cannabis and Etizolam, was a very good trip.


But even so, 370ug 1cP yesterday- (160ug at 11.35 am, 50ug with kava at 6 pm, 100ug at 10 pm), was intense as fuck overall.  Redosing absolutely works for me but I start it always has there is a way to go about it I think.


But I did take a lot of kava as well, from 6 pm. About 4 strong doses. I have been taking kava daily for a few weeks. There is a reverse tolerance and the effects get stronger with smaller doses.


The instant kava I have and the extract are very strong. Synergy with cannabis and particularly with LSD in terms of intensification of both substances I was really surprised at the power of this combination.


I was very very wasted, out of it, fucked, take your pick. Very strong and intense affects both physically and mentally. I didnt have nearly as much cannabis vaporization, and the kava caused an increase in the way cannabis intensifies the acid.


I had a really bad trip actually because of the stressful home situation and some other factors. Massive anxiety, panic attack phases and some severe stress.


This morning, after a little very strong vaped weed....I was so flaming wasted from acid and Kava.


Really really mindblown. Head trashed, I was really feeling the 1cp LSD physically as intensely as I ever feel an afterglow of LSD in my life.


Too much drugs for my brain at the time. Due to kava/cannabis potentiation.


I mean, part of it was good in that it was an amazing psychoactive state but I was just in a bad way still.


Slept on/off today. Until 4 pm. Cannabis edibles at 6.30pm. Still tripping, if not visually ( I think I was everything has been very bright and colourful all day ), mentally.


Very intense LSD headspace, on edge of anxiety.  7.30 pm I took a decent dose of kava, plus 50ug more 1cP.


I was unsure about taking any more acid because I could sense I was on the edge of anxiety and panic attack again still with the effects still so intense in my system.


But I felt the need for a stimulant affect and also to try and shift my headspace back in a more positive Direction which can work this way with tripping.


As soon as I had drank the kava I instantly felt some major relief from my woeful and agitated mindset. Instant physical relaxation as well. I will dose again, instant with some extract added.


The 50ug, I expect to bump me back up to pretty much full tripping just without the full visual display. I would have been off of my head for days without a redose tonight.


So in this circumstance such a small dose can be really significant and I think was the right thing to do. The kava should keep me calm. I will avoid heavy doses of avid with kava from now on.


I prefer the smaller trips actually in combo with weed, kava, etizolam.


More etizolam on the way from Holland. Damn did I need a bit yesterday.

Just received another batch of blotters the first batch I had when it came available were all white now they have the molecule name printed on them. Am I the only one who finds the blotters more potent than the pellets at the same dosage ? I thought the first white batch were maybe overdosed when I tried the pellets to lesser effects but now this other batch of blotters also seem as potent. I noticed the same with 1p-lsd for blotters vs pellets. I though it could be because I could keep the blotters in my mouth that they were absorbed better than the pills you have to swallow eventually but I tried swallowing the blotters immediately and they still seemed as potent.

Oral bioavailability is almost 100% for lysergimides. The potency shouldn’t be affected by whether or not you swallow it or not, simply the rapidity of the onset.

I have only taken one single micro pellet after 1plsd which I picked up to see if I could tolerate it.

But I had already heard subjective reports saying that the micro pellets seemed stronger than the blotters dose for dose.


On "paper" (lol), it really should make no difference. I actually suspect it really might make no difference at all as long as the same amount of micrograms are actually consumed, and that any apparent discrepancies are the result of our imaginations possibly.


I don't mean to discount your own experience or rule out what you are asking. Regarding oral vs sublingual- I have always subbed my acid. But lately I have just been swallowing straight down most of the time and I honestly don't think there's any difference in potency certainly not weaker and the onset is still fast enough.


Maybe the 1cP pellets were underdosed, for all we know. There is an analysis report for a 1p LSD micro pellet on ecstasy data.org, showing exactly 151ug.


Which is very assuring don't you think. I feel very confident that the green creatures know what they are doing, with excellent quality control.

I found out that carrying (whatever it was) through the airport security check inside a cigarette pack is a very dumb idea... So, hopefully, whoever's reading this and isn't aware of this yet will now interpret my words as true because IT WILL BUZZ and the security people shouldn't be stupid enough to let you go, or be let go from their job because of your stupidity, so don't bother. Better to be safe than sorry. Or dumb than sorry anyway...

How is that story relevant in a thread about 1cp-lsd ? Was that what you were carrying in the cigarette pack ? Can you give more details about the incident starting from the beginning because I have a hard time following what exactly you are trying to say here.

Ok I will say that it has happened. Still not sure if that story is relevant in this thread at all, I've shot acid five or six times in my life at most that's all I know, so this could have been 1cp-lsd or not. There were 5-6 blotters inside a pack of cigarettes. As I kept passing through the metal detector it kept buzzing, until the security employee finally narrowed it down to the pack of cigarettes. I kinda played it cool, although looking back on it now, I was out of my mind. 


And I got through with it. Then, as I was waiting for my connection flight in a different country, I decided to take one and I threw the others away, it made me really paranoid, the fear of getting stuck there, in this far place. Felt like an endless loop of walking around the airport being lost in space and time and spending money just buying something like every 5 minutes in currency that was alien to me. It was cool though. 


Then I realised that my gate didn't have a security control again this time, but it was already too late. This was my last time tripping. I've lost my interest in it since, too...

Nothing wrong with sharing that story here or anywhere. Obviously one is naturally always looking for a meaningful context.


But no point whatsoever being so cryptic and mysterious. No sense commenting that vaguely and remotely so I'm glad you shared with us.


One thing I can pretty much guarantee you is there is no way it was 1cp LSD because this is not something which is floating around on the black market.


1plsd, ALD- 52 have certainly been distributed on street and black market LSD tabs has LSD 25 but 1cp LSD is so fresh and new I doubt anybody has gotten around to that yet.


All 1cP LSD tabs will be laid by green men and ladies in Holland for the moment.


Give it a few years and depending on the outcome of the Dutch government proposals to ban many of these compounds permanently, and hence availability, and you may well come across 1cp LSD on the street.


But on to your trip itself. Yeah that just isn't the right way to go about it really for an enjoyable and and comfortable experience. I personally don't think that airports and tripping mix very well at all give me a ferry and a boat ride any day.

It was probably my favourite trip. More like a trip within a trip. Got me sorted out emotionally, very cathartic. Really intense. Gave me perspective. I personally don't think about tripping as something that should be enjoyed, I don't believe it anymore. I am speaking from limited experience and about a wrong substance possibly. And I'm done with it for now.

Ok so you did not get caught. Thank god because it sounded like that from your description with the buzzing and the pack. But yeah tripping in an airport when you are actually carrying stuff must be a paranoid hell to say the least. Glad it turned out ok for you. But if you really want to be carrying stuff like that there are safer methods  than a cig pack. Like taping it to your balls (a guy I know did that with cocaine once...). Or diluting your blotters in some drink or shreadding them to small pieces and adding them in capsules of a otc herbal remedy. Hits of acid are among the easiest to conceal because they are tiny and have no smell. Anyway I guess after that bad trip you won't be tempted to try that again...I know I would probably not!

Can you elaborate?  Was there an incident? Please share.


Maybe one of those E numbers has some metallic aspect, orveven the silica may contain some natural trace metal? 


Or possible coincidental metal contamination on the pellets somehow.


Those would have to surely be the only possibilities?

I definitely think so. Ever since I started on the 1cp LSD recently I have felt barely any urge or interests at all to dip back into my 1p supply I just find the 1cp LSD to be be so much easier to enjoy and physically more pleasurable and gentle without too much of an intense and some come up which I do experience personally with 1plsd.


And absolutely no question there is a greater potency to 1cp LSD microgram per microgram. I have had better and more enjoyable trips on 50 ug of 1cp LSD and I have done 100ug on 1plsd.


But those are just my feelings so you may want to see how others feel 1p LSD has a different quality to it which is definitely appreciable at the same time.

I am afraid I do not understand your post here at all, like where you are coming from and what you feel is being insinuated?  


I feel like it's one of those situations where yeah are there has been a misunderstanding, where you have misinterpreted a harmless remark as a potentially deliberate or flippant insinuation.


My comment and suggestion to only travel with blotters in future, was a purely genuine suggestion. I mean we have no idea why the pellets would trigger the metal detector. 


I would just feel a lot safer and more confidence personally if I had such an experience, to have my acid on paper and not in a pill with numerous additional ingredients. 


Im sure you must have misunderstood my comment entirely, I really was not having a dig or making any sort of negative, critical, patronizing or flippant remark. I mean come on, give us some credit. I simply tried to help with genuine info and suggestions.


I believe we all did. No medals required here, not even any recognition.


But to at least recognize that nobody has mocked you, disbelieved you, reproached homemade any attempt to be different or offensive.....


Well that would be a worthy recognition rather than a potentially delusional belief otherwise(?)

To me it's a mystery still, how it could have been triggering the detector, but obviously it's a reality. At least now I know that I would never attempt it again, nor would I suggest it to anyone. But if you wanna try your luck go ahead lol

Okay it's all clear now. Please excuse me. I have been very cained of late from a ton of acid, weed and Kava.


So what really happened is there has been a double misunderstanding here because I missed it you for the original poster of the thread as several foggy days transpired.


So when I suggested that you only travelled with blotters, obviously this did not make any logical sense to you as to where I was coming from and may have seemed like a patronising or flippant remark.


I was simply thinking of you as the original poster when I made that comment. 

My above reply was merely as soon as he attempts to try and and iron out any misunderstanding which was actually much clearer and more straightforward and logical and my dumbfounded mental faculties were currently capable of deciphering.


So please excuse me for causing the original misunderstanding by way of mistaken identity I certainly meant you no offence or disrespect.


And a very Happy New Year to you, and everybody of course.

Was it not inside a cigarette pack ? Most cigarette packs have an aluminium foil sheet that covers the cigarettes so it was probably what made the detector beep.

I was going to make that exact point myself but since it seems to be completely overlooked I didn't Trust my thinking on it and it seemed I have gotten mixed up.


I should have just listenned to my gut when it was trying to tell me the obvious explanation.


So in future, one coul temove all foil from inside.

No it isn't that, it's just that as I grow older, my life is getting more boring in a way, as well and such opportunities don't come as easily as before.


There's no way of getting acid for me nowadays, so growing shrooms is all that I could do if I ever wanted to be tripping again. Which now seems as hardly even worth the effort, because I don't even like shrooms nearly as much. They don't come close to acid imo.


I haven't done as much shrooms as acid, have taken them on just 2 or 3 occasions at most. So it's possible that I could still be proven wrong about shrooms.


That was some good stuff that I have thrown away foolishly.

You should definitely re-explore mushrooms if you only took them 3 times. They are very very interesting. prepare them with lemon tek, makes them much better IME.

You should 100% be able to get acid, depending on your location.


Are yiou familiar with what this specific thread is actually about? 1cP LSD is legal in many countires, but I have been ordering it here to UK no problrm all yesr (well since July, it was 1plsd before that was made illegal to impor t into Germany ).


But I can still get 1plsd from Holland, but i choose the 1cP every time because I feel it is stronger, better, more enjoyable.


If yoh are  in Europe, there is a very good chance you will have options at your mouseclick  doorstep.


If in USA, then there are Canadians who are in the business of helping in this Direction and also some Europeans I believe will ship to the USA.


Its all there to be had my friend, we are living in a golden age of lysergamide availability.  Lsd 25 is pretty abindantly circulatiing the world at the same time as muliple Lsd homologues are available to buy on the clearnet.  Get involved bro,,don't miss out if you dont want to.

That's impossible to answer it could be months it could be years it could be decades we just don't know the global manufacturers of these lysergamides recently put up a newsletter announcement on their website informing us that there may be some changes on the way and that certain products may disappear in which case we may wish to stuff up while the chance is there but none of this was black and white or definite in terms of timeline or or what would actually happen.


Still it makes sense to recognise the privilege of being able to acquire such entirely pure and trustworthy safe psychedelic compounds and medicines while the opportunity is there are and make the most of it hence my my attempts to raise awareness for others to hopefully benefit from the knowledge and realisation.


[@KnowsNotWhatItMean](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/472485/) Very good luck my friend on your own Quest in this Direction I really hope we get to hear some positive feedback and input from you on this and really sorry if it felt like we gave you a hard time I'm we just wanted to know a little more about your situation so we could help for better advice but also we are all here to learn from each other's experience however seemingly minor and significant.


So please feel free to always and certainly never feel self-conscious or afraid of being patronized on this website which is remarkably accepting and open-minded you get out of it exactly what you put into it it more than any other forum I think I participate in currently.


Tripping today again on about 105ug 1cp LSD. I took 2.5 mg of etizolam also which has not prevented me from tripping. I have just dosed on cannabis edibles and kava both of which potentiates each other and LSD strongly.


More Kava will fellow, as I expect will weed but the LSD is harder to enjoy when feeling safe to be clearly unwell physically so I may not consume any more of that drug today if I can exercise Wisdom and discipline.


Those have never been my strong suits haha and I get myself into insane scrapes all of the time in life and always has been the way.


[@Alberth](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/353880/) and [@KnowsNotWhatItMean](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/472485/) I would be glad to to help with a little Direction and advice should you wish to explore these rates especially for microdosing purposes for which these clearnet lysergamides I keep emphasizing are perfect because of the accuracy and consistency of the dosage.    


Rigjt guys. Got some work to do now. Not in a fantastic place ATM but hoping to be in significantly higher spirit and bodily comfort before the evening is out wish me luck! 


Happy and safe tripping all round.

I cant take lemon at all, or lime/vinegar. You know my unusual situation pretty well by now and I have have no idea how I could tolerate psilocybin mushrooms not having taken any since 2005.


I tried supermarket edible mushrooms in about 2006 and I had a really weird reaction it was strange like everything was distorted and I felt peculiar for a few hours lol a unique food intolerance for sure.  My visual field was affected, like uneven fairground mirrors.


But I am definitely going to try psilocybin mushrooms at some point because you just never know.


In my oponion, anybody who takes acid should also use mushrooms when possible and appropriate


Regarding the whole lemon Tek method one thought I had which might work equally effectively my mum makes our own raw sauerkraut and the juice is incredibly sour and salty and sharp like lemon and vinegar I imagine a few teaspoons of this in a company moment with either micro or macro doses of mushrooms would have an effect similar or close to lemon Tek.

I am kind of concerned about buying, because I'm trying to imagine a scenario where I pay, they send it, it gets intercepted by the customs upon entering my country and then I have to present a proof of payment, or a proof that this is not 'the LSD' and that it's completely legal, which would be funny and this definitely happens when I am ordering stuff from outside EU at least. I am actually considering buying some, but something tells me it might not go so well, some things never arrive, for example the last spore print which I have payed for has never arrived either.

I am actually considering buying some, but something tells me it might not go so well, some things never arrive, for example the last spore print which I have payed for has never arrived either.

Well all I can tell you is that this has been going on in enormous abundance for years and years there are hundreds of thousands of people ordering these chemicals all over the world constantly and I think I have heard of One case of an interception and a court case but that is it I've not heard of another mention of any actual penalization or a negative repercussions coming as a result of ordering these clearnet lysergamides except for people not receiving their orders as being the only negative outcome reported.


Yes there is always a risk because this is still such a great area with technical loopholes and I honestly don't think anybody in the world actually genuinely thoroughly and truly understands it's regarding the law here and how it would pertain to each individual situation and how any particular case might play out in court.


I do know that very very many packages have been and continue to be intercepted by customs and authorities all over the world and all that happens is the product is confiscated there is actually significantly greater risk buying lsd-25 itself on the dark Web where there is a determined and concerted focus by the law enforcement agencies to actually make it sample of people and Crackdown and and make arrests etc.


The risks when it comes to ordering these clearnet lysergamides are really so incredibly minuscule and you have so much to gain by taking this pitifully small chance I have myself received about 10 or 11 successive completely problem-free orders to the United Kingdom where are these compounds are not legal.


So far this year that is and I have honestly not been worried about the process or any potential repercussions accept losing my goods in transit.


So give it a phone my friend you really don't have too much to lose or be afraid of just ordered a few tabs like 5 tabs or something and have a little fun if it is something you may be able to enjoy. If you would like a little Direction then please feel free to contact me and I would gladly try to hrlp.

How much did you dose? 


Was it enjoyable? 


Was this your first trip in a long while?


Did it live up to your expectations? Have you taken classic lsd-25 before and if so were you struck by any obvious apparent differences?


Haha, sorry for the quiz just giving you a few pointers to maybe share a little more feedback with us all I'm sure others are interested and curious as well.


I have finally managed to discipline myself to stop gobbling my own personal 1cP after 50 tabs in as many days.


The thing is I just didn't seem to be developing much tolerance to it and I was still getting very worthwhile and strong effects from all sorts of doses although obviously different in nature and experience vs no tolerance.


I have actually felt a little crazy since I think I underestimated how much tripping can actually affect your mind and when you cram them, but it was a strong mix with Kava especially plus potent weed always.


Its nice to step back though for a while and let the dust settle. I'm looking forward to getting back into proper and more disciplined microdosing after a little break.

Hey. Still did not try the ALD yet. I wanted it to be a special occasion which is yet to come around as many things in life are "panning out" slowly, step by step.


My recent tripping was a big kick start to a radical mental shift healing triggering. Lots of downloads to assimilate now. 


The 1cP was just so consistently enjoyable, I never felt compelled to try the ALD.


Sometime soon though when the time is right hopefully but really I'm so totally chilled about the prospect of when that comes around I'm not itching to do it.


Just taking each day at a time for the moment thankful to be alive and if I'm feeling reasonably ok then that alone is magical. 


Who knows what tomorrow or next week holds?!

My recent explorations in this and other lysergamides have proven most effective for improving my mental health as well.

I believe my ALD is unevenly laid. I dont have enough trials to tell yet... Could just be set/setting

But over4 trials at 200 ug2 have been noticably stronger.

I've read that 1cP is short acting but the trip was still on for me after more than 24 hour mark, until I got some sleep that is. It takes a while for it to kick in though.


I have found the effects to be enjoyable during the peak, but during the comedown it gets a bit tiring and isn't very much enjoyable. I didn't have any pot with me.  All in all I'm going to take a break for a while, save it for an occasional trip it might last me a year or two. I'm not sure if it can expire?

Functional doses work best without pot, in my experience. It has a clarity that you forfeit once you toke up, I'd rather just take a bland substance that doesn't affect my tolerance and binge some weed on that instead.


On doses beyond functionality it's a bit of a bummer if you can't turn it up a notch whenever you want. Or smooth out the comedown, yeah. Wouldn't therefore call it a waste though.


It does expire more rapidly than other substances. You want to protect it from sunlight, heat and air. So wrap it up accordingly and put it in the fridge, and then it shouldn't be a problem. I sent some acid analogue to an almost tropical island once, and the recipient didn't check the mailbox like he said he would. One week exposure to Mediterranean climate did noticeably diminish the potency with, say, one fourth, to give you an idea.

Absolutely not.  Weed interacts strongly with psychedelics but I usually prefer them without weed these days.  Of course I usually don't smoke anymore, I only do sometimes instead of habitually.  Weed makes psychedelics more wild, stronger for sure, but also less clear/more muddy/confused.  I tend to get more actual utility out of psychedelics without weed.

Too bad Al-LAD is no longer available. I only got to try it once at 300 ug at the tail end of a 4-aco-mipt trip. The CEV were some of the wildest I had ever seen it felt like I was in some alien space-station. Would have loved to try it again !

I don't smoke weed thus I've never smoked weed while on acid, and I can tell you it absolutely not a waste.


Though, I guess you can say since I've never done it, my opinion isn't valid. I have done nitrous while tripping, and I'd say 100% that you're not getting all you can out of low-ish doses of psychedelics without it. But it doesn't even begin to approach a "waste". It can just the experience from a 8.8/10 to 9.8/10 in 20 seconds.

Im sure I saw an announcement posted somewhere (unofficial but appeared to be based on some intel), that Al- Lad will be returning in 2020.


It has only been discontinued due to more complex production method and lower yield, therefore higher production cost. But there is demand, and these madter Dutch greenfingered Labcoats seem committed to creating and providing as many high quality chems as the market calls for.


So for all we know they may have been working behind closed doors on alternative synthesis routes.


Same for ALD- 52. I do expect we may see that one surface again as well well although demand is not as great I don't think as will the AL-LAD the but this is a lack of education and awareness in my view you as well as a lack of experience obviously.

That would be great ! Ald-52 is still available where I live. Al-lad is pretty much the only lysergamide RC that is not available anymore here.

I have done nitrous while tripping, and I'd say 100% that you're not getting all you can out of low-ish doses of psychedelics without it. But it doesn't even begin to approach a "waste". It can just the experience from a 8.8/10 to 9.8/10 in 20 seconds.

I was just feeling too wasted while coming down and couldn't sleep I just thought that if I had some weed it would have made up for it. Make comedown better.

I mean this trip wasn't planned or anything, I just took it within hour or two after receiving it, otherwise I think that having some pot when tripping is almost a must, for the comedown at least. Although acid comedown is sometimes enjoyable without any weed or anything, this time I seriously felt altered after 24 hours but I was getting sort of tired of it and couldn't sleep. I am definitely gonna try and make sure that I've got some pot with me the next time around, to smoothen the edges out.

Yes I have to say, I just couldn't imagine tripping without weed. But I have been psychologically addicted to cannabis since aged 17, I'm almost 40 now.


I usually hit vaporizer within an hour of dropping acid, just to "ease" that initial intensity (yeah right lol). Im not sure that really plays according to plan but there is a soothing factor in there. 


I usually go quite long spells between vapor though during trips. I just don't need a lot. 


Rather than little and often, I tend to wait until my headspace feels really grounded, settled, clear from cannabis's murkiness, and I'm almost beginning, at the specific stage of the trip, to be twiddling my thumbs, feeling a refreshing upsurge in positive mental energy, and seeing and thinking only positively.


I then bring weed back in. But usually not too much. Just a few very good hits until Im positively buzzing and everything is brightly coloured again.


So I don't vape a great amount, or close together, WHILE I'm tripping.


One positive knock on effect of this this is how my head is still fairly fresh for the cannabis experience towards the end of the trip and the following day.


So a moderate intake of vaporized cannabinoids actually goes a long way and brings about a really noticeable positive mental shift.


[@babooon87](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/119267/) I expect certain vendors simply bought enough ALD th at stock has yet to dwindle. It is, from the imptession I have formed anyway, generally not so sought after as the other lysergamides.


1p has such a huge reputation most new folks struggle to see past it.

Surely 1cP will overtake it here in time with more widespread availability and experience.


But ALD-52 still flies largely under the radar in terms of people not realising how great it is and I say that without even having taken it myself.


I have reduced my weed vaping heavily of late. I have been so drawn to kava everyday day and the two don't necessarily mix despite strong potentiation and I can't really handle the cannabis vaporization at the moment with kava in the mix.


I'm still using the edibles for my digestion.

But kava,  as I already reported in this thread is such a strong potentiator and enhancer of acid.


Kava is actually a psychedelic plant medicine itself which works subtly on the consciousness but is a powerful drug at the same time in a physical sense for the brain and body I think dopamine is heavily involved and I was under the impression many years ago that LSD produces floods of serotonin primarily, with MDMA producing both.

Im really glad you had a good trip, despite the edginess on the comedown without any herb. What dose did you have? 1 tab/100ug? 


Was it your first trip for a long whike, like few years?

I assume you have past experience with Lsd 25?  


But yeah, def get some nice weed on hand next time and no hurry, like you say. 

Enjoy that afterglow. I have found that there is a really good and strong after go with 1cp LSD where I'm really feeling warm pleasant body sensations which are immediately enhanced and brought back up by cannabis for several days.

It was 1 tab/100 ug. It was my 7th or 8th acid trip, first 1cP-LSD trip. I have to say that I am still feeling a subtle remnant of psychedelic effects, but it hasn't been full 3 days yet since dosing has taken place. I'm pretty sure it will go away completely within a week or two, I'll report back hahah...

Hi, thank you for elaborating I'm just naturally curious cat and I like details lol! Yes what you describe is what I always experienced myself I think it's the fact that not everybody is nearly as in tune with their body and subtle mental states that less people are aware of the lingering effects but for me certainly it's highly noticeable for several days afterwards and up to a week and is especially bumped up when I vaporise cannabis.


So see if you can get some weed and have a smoke as soon as you can because the stronger those lingering effects before they wear off more the more you will notice the increase after smoking weed.


Glad you enjoyed it man all the best.

I love smoking weed on acid. Not on the come-up though, needs to be at the peak or come-down. Otherwise things can get wonky lol.


Haven't tried 1cP yet but I always liked mixing it in on AL-LAD, ALD-52, and classic L.

Yeah, I think that lingering effects are gone now, I was feeling some when I woke up today, but haven't noticed anything throughout the day.


Either way I will be doing more 1cP, I don't know how soon will this stuff become criminalised though, but this thread will probably remain up and active and people will still be doing it, so at least I'll have more to elaborate once I have done all 1000 ug, than at this very moment (or less, depending on how potent my tabs will remain).


I'd say that it's not bad stuff at all, not at all, but there's probably people in this forum who have done considerably more of this substance than I have, your words are truly important simply because this is still a relatively new compound and all...

In my mind, it is just a pure, clean, equally safe, potent and enjoyable compound as LSD 25. It isnt really new at all, and is essentially the same thing. 


Just slightly different. I always make sure somebody knows which specific lysergamide I am referring to for the sake of total transparency but past that I simply referred to any of these lysergamides as acid or LSD to make things simple.


Keep your tabs in foil, film, bag, maybe add a dessicant if you have any handy and and at as low a temperature as practical and they should maintain virtually full potency for years if not decades there is is an inaccurate Superstition about the degradation of LSD it's much more stable than people are led to believe.


If you can get it into an airtight container with some desiccant wrapped in the foil and Cling Film and put it in the fridge just make sure you don't open the container until it has reached room temperature then you should be able to to maintain the potency for decades.


And yes please do come and report back to us when you have had some more experience.

One problem though, it makes me depressed. I wouldn't blame it on actual acid, but I'm definitely down now and I was in fact very positive before I had it for a long time, it's probably a subjective reaction more than anything else, but it's also due to some realisations about my life that this trip had brought to surface, I think it served as a catalyst to make me realise that some stuff about my reality that makes it work the way it does might not be very real indeed and that I should finally let some stuff go but I'm still struggling with it, personal stuff. But anyway, that's my observation, I need to pull myself together, acid made me see it. I'm probably taking it with a wrong intention in mind, this is a powerful substance after all and should be used in a respectful manner.

I understand exactly where you're coming from and honestly I wouldn't worry about it at this moment it will pass actually in my experience. It is especially on certain occasions when I haven't tripped for a fairly long while and I will feel really strangely melancholy and quite emotional sensitive a day or two later for about 36 hours where I feel like I have lost something and I'm not as together mentally in terms of keeping my thoughts positive and upbeat and happy.


And I'm pretty sure that this is partly a result of tiredness and fatty but mostly subconscious and unconscious processing and rearrangements and getting used to the changes and adjustments and Sparks of realisation which have occurred without us being even conscious of them.


And then I can experience a total swing back and feel remarkably more positive and clear-headed and confident about everything and the future and just being alive and not taking anything for granted today then I have done for a long time before the trip.


So hopefully that will be your own experience as well where you will feel much more upbeat again after another day or so.

I have found it amusing that 1plsd has held such notoriety over ald-52 despite Aldi unquestionably being the superior lysergamide. Obviously availability of 1p LSD has been rampantly high in recent years so that will be the overwhelming Factor.


But it is interesting to see that just recently the notoriety of those other two, better lysergamides in my opinion, has come up for a lot as 1p searches have dropped and I would imagine that's in two or three years time 1p LSD searches will be significantly less than 1cp LSD searches and possibly even ald-52 if the chemists can find a more efficient production route and it becomes more widespread again.


All depends on the success of the Dutch government to Outlaw all of it of course but if production continues and ALD does re-emerge I would predicts it too to rapidly pick up acclaim and notoriety, and drawing more interest than it ever has done before, just as it deserves.

Thanks for sharing that. Useful feedback. And I have not actually taken ALD 52 yet myself. It lays in waiting. But 1plsd certainly has some aspects which I don't like so much about it and I am basing my judgement on the amount of prayers and growing reports and appreciation I have seen across the board by the smaller minority of people who have taken ald-52.


It seems very common for people to prefer it to lsd-25 and lsd-25 is generally preferred to 1plsd, this is at least the general impression I have warmed through much research and and overviewing of the wide world of psychonauts and their experiences and feelings on all of this.


I have been using these topics which have been of lifelong interest to me as a distraction for illness and suffering for the last year but my brain and mental faculties are shockingly poor and compromised I have to disclaim.


So it could be a personal thing. But I have heard so many reports of people particularly preferring ald-52 to the other lysergamides.


I have much been preferring 1cp LSD to 1p LSD so far.

Evidence can suggest what it likes. Experience can tell otherwise, too compellingly to be placebo by a very long way. "Should" doesn't always equal IS.


But but I still argue that essentially they are all pretty much the same thing just with some slight differences for those with a sharper bodily intuition and attunement to the psychedelic experience.

nobody is suggesting these are not psychedelics, but if I were a betting man, I would suggest that in a double blind trial nobody would be able to tell the difference between LSD and, say, ALD-52 or 1P-LSD at comparable doses. Even someone "with a sharper bodily intuition and attunement to the psychedelic experience.".


the problem with "psychedelic metrics" is that every trip is different w.r.t. set and setting, there's a tremendous variability in trips even just tracking one person taking the same dose on a consistent basis, the human psyche is never "tabula rasa" and is definitely not a controlled environment


this reminds me of a story where tim scully and associates took 10 grams of LSD and split it 5 ways, dyeing each batch a different color, and pressing them all into tablets of the same dosage, then distributing them. eventually word gets back to him that "the red ones are more spiritual, the green ones are stimulating, the purple ones have a body high" and so on, despite the fact the batches of pills were made by the same process with the same dosage.


I trust binding assays way more than I trust personal experience when it coems to determining what the actual activity of drugs are.

But wouldn't the fact the prodrugs need to be metabolized alter the rate at which the LSD reaches the brain, or any other variable at all? I'm not sure whether lack of prodrug binding is enough to eliminate all intersubjective difference.


(Theoretical musing only, in practice I'm not really that interested because I bet variability in synthesis can easily outweigh any actual underlying difference.)

Have you guys seen this?

[Study Finds ALD-52, 1P-LSD, and 1B-LSD Are Prodrugs of LSD](https://psychedelicreview.com/study-finds-ald-52-1p-lsd-and-1b-lsd-are-prodrugs-of-lsd/)

What stands out for me is that they all have vastly different binding affinities than LSD. Which, imo, likely accounts for their vastly different effects.

IMO it’s more to do with the fact that our bodies metabolize certain things differently. ALD-52 feels smoother/longer than say, 1P which is harsh and abrupt, because our bodies probably metabolize them into LSD in different manners, therefore adjusting the rate at which you experience the acid.

I agree there is def a metabolic factor at play here.

And as weve all got different metabolisms I think that may acct for why some ppl find these prodrugs indistinguishable from acid. Perhaps they metabolism them into lsd faster .... and thus the binding affinities are more akin to those of lsd

Ok ok *vastly* may have been slightly over exaggerating 

I havent many trials with the prodrugs, likely ~100 with lsd over the years though,and I find the timelines/effects of the prodrugs to be noticeably different than actual lsd

Well guys I have to say I will always trust my own mind and experience and judgement and intuition more than some theoretically acclaimed and accurate study which very strongly contradicts my own overwhelmingly and undeniably compelling experiences in my experience there is an unquestionable difference between 1p LSD and 1cp LSD and I am not alone here there is no way this is just the imagination absolutely no way simple as that bottom line whatever the studies say we are not so clever as mankind as we think and make out in a scientific and rational evidence-based way and we have moved so far away from our own intuition and ability to to decipher and judge and trust our perceptions and feelings.

Lets not forget subjectivity: experiments have shown for example the same batch of acid, half one colour half another and people attributed stimulant contamination to one batch.  People given downers and told they had consumed an upper; experiencing stimulation and so on. 

Suggestibility can be high on a psychedelic.

People do “Swim” reports also do multiple substances, even from a few days before is going to load or deplete transmitters.

Having said that I do believe that experienced users may arrive at a consensus

Me personally, I found no difference between 1P-LSD and LSD. I can't remember if I ever had ALD.


Then again I'm pretty accepting that every trip is a little different depending on a bunch of factors. Even with tabs from the same sheet, no two trips are ever the same. I think that's a bit of a confounding factor in "pharmacology by feelings".


There could also be some relation to the actual dose of drug delivered, given that it's very hard to determine the actual dose of LSD on any particular tab. Could just be the commercial analog tabs have more alkaloid on 'em than black market ones or vice-versa.

exactly, how the paper is doped, and if the user is cutting blotters this also affects the apparent dosage (because it may not be spread evenly within the square of paper).


the dosage between blotters and between batches varies. (as well as set and setting)


I treat all my ald-52 and a-lad blotters as subdosed, and all my ethlads and 1-p's as superdosed by as much as 25% and that along with the ongoing conversation has me agreeing that ald is smoother than 1p because **my **ald blotters are weaker than **my **1p-lsd blotters.


this across a few vendors - I think no vendors are being accurate in dosing, but who knows, subjectivity is hugely magnified once any of the effects begin.


I miss real lsd, and lsz. but I don't do darknet, though I  probably have real lsd once my blood cleaves the propanyl etc.

Yes, take something for your cough; i sometimes get this with any psychedelic. Drink more water and juice. Smoke a bowl if you need to potentiate the trip, if uou’re already comfy with both on their own, of course.

Tripping just is not any sort of guarantee of a good, enjoyable time or mememorable experience.


It can actually feel like a waste of time on occasions, like the wrong way to be feeling, thinking, experienc9ng the world at that time.


That is propably where I personally find a redose or several can pay off divixends. Some positive redirection and mood uplift.


But that could just be me.

But sometimes we just aren't in the right shape or mental headspace for the psychedelic experience and it seems kind of pointless and boring as well as uncomfortable.

In terms of stoichiometry, assuming the analogs act as prodrugs for LSD, the math works out like so:


LSD tartrate has a MW 323.44+150.09 (LSD freebase+tartaric acid) = 473.53 g/mol

1Ac-LSD.tartrate*** MW 365.48+150.09 = 515.57 g/mol  = equivalent to 91.8% the potency of LSD

1P-LSD.tartrate MW 379.50+150.09 = 529.59 g/mol = 89.4% LSD equiv

1CP-LSD.tartrate MW 391.52+150.09  = 541.61 g/mol = 87.4% LSD equiv

1B-LSD.tartrate MW 393.53+150.09 = 543.62 g/mol = 87.1% LSD equiv


that is, I'd expect 100 ug of 1Ac-LSD to be similar in effects to a 90ug LSD trip.

Yeah I agree about the overexageration of lsd's degradation. I found it the hard way by taking drops of acid that were diluted in tap water in a plastic bottle that I had stored like this for about one year. I was sure it would have degraded to almost nothing from what I had read. Well...to my suprise (and horror when it hit me like a ton of bricks) it was still pretty damn close to it's full potency...

It's arbitrary. Amphetamines are the only class I know that degrades rapidly at room temp, after 20 years. All other drug classes have shown 90% potency retention after 40 years if properly stored.

you know what the 150 mic allergy test i did actually impressed me, i would rather have a sheet of this over 1p or ALD 52 actually. I would barely even feel 150 mics of those two compounds after years of abuse but this 1cp-lsd is  giving me visuals at 150 mics which is surprising.  Maybe give me time and i will ruin this drug for myself too, but its seems more potent, or its all placebo YMMV

I'm sorry, did you store them for 20 years in a pill bottle and then laboratory test them for potency? No? Okay.


The researchers who conducted this study found that amphetamine degraded faster than other drug classes. **This was after 20-40 years.** Seems pretty sound to me. There are no biases here, I'm simply citing facts.


By said study's reasoning, after 6 years your adderall would still be in the 90% potency range.


My only reason for citing said study was to point out that expiration dates on pill bottles are a crock of shit. So essentially, I'm saying the same thing you are, only you're insisting upon making it rude.

I spontaneously took a tab's worth last night. Very unplanned and unexpectedly and I'm not sure I really knew what I was doing at the time it was extremely compulsive in a heightened state of euphoria and perception already.


It was a really stressful day and I medicated quite heavily with a big jar of kava and I also took 3 milligrams of etizolam which strongly is potentiatated by the kava especially the euphoria and light-headed giddiness.


I haven't tripped properly for about 6 weeks due to nasty winter illnesses but I really felt like I needed a reasonable dose I have been microdosing but then practically daily dosing as a stimulant pickup and antidepressant through very tough times.


Like 10 micrograms to 15 most of the time but 20 at times although yesterday I stepped it up with a 25 microgram dose which felt right and really helped the situation and my Outlook and general feeling within my body and energy field.


I added another 10 micrograms followed by another 10 a short while later and then in a very spontaneous moment after a delicious bowl of cereal feeling incredibly high but so comfortable and totally care free I decided to take a half tab of 1cp LSD which had been sitting cut diagonally in a bag for a few months.


It was a slightly bigger half tab so I took about 100ug over an hour and a half except I was due to eat some more food and I underestimated how hard that extra half tab was going to hit me it was a really significant effect and experience in combination with the kava and the etizolam did not counteract the effects of the acid if anything it intensified it for me visually and in terms of headspace and altered feeling and thinking in a positive way.


I struggled to eat my second plate of food over many hours having underestimated the intensity of the come up from the second 50ug.


I had really quite a full experience which surprised me because I have been taking daily doses practically over previous weeks but I was still able to trip very strongly with 100ug spread out


Strong compound IMO, especially when potentiated by kava and cannabis.

Yes it is surprisingly potent and tolerance seems to develop less than with other lysergamides for some reason.

I did wonder about that actually. I honestly continued to get very worthwhile and consistent effects when macrodosing frequently.  Gosh, I just edited a trillion auto correct errors above. Been very wasted, I'm sure you noticed the many nonsensical words in places, sorry for any confusion.


Be well my friend.

Well despite some recent trips (last Sunday and the start of the month) plan is to combo this with dxm again tomorrow. 


Im not religious, nor am I on time, but I could use a good reset so... I think Im going to hop on the Lent bandwagon and practice 6 weeks of reflective abstinence - quit some vices and start Intermittent Fasting. 


But first,some encouragement and a nice little afterglow to get me started lol... Everyones out of the house for the day so Ill have a solid 12 hrs to myself.

Plan is to start with 500 mg dxm and follow it up with 300 mcg 1cp-lsd an hr later... maybe 300mg more dxm shortly thereafter ... Well see how Im feeling. 


Ill write back if anything notable happens ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) lol

50 mics of 1cp with two tokes of mazar sharif (afgani hash) and a relaxed evening with lots of rich OEV ensued, very little tension or squirming of any kind, and lots of overlay of moments of sensation - easy to just keep breathing and watching.


this is a new fave combo.

Yeah man, having tried literally all sorts of doses my favourite and most positive experiences so far have actually been exactly half tabs or 50 ug roughly combined with cannabis usually an edible at the same time followed by flexible and spontaneous vaporization when I feel like it which is normally several hours later after the mini peak has settled out.


In no way have I felt that these experiences are lacking everything is really brightly coloured and there is a very noticeable and appreciable change in Perception of all things but it feels like my head is in two different worlds at the same time where I have my usual wits about me but it's like the most high and happy uplifted weed buzz but much better and more transcendental and really able to appreciate the glory of life and my surroundings without being overwhelmed at all.

Like pupnik said, 50 mics of lysergamides with some cannabis is very blissful and yet a totally together trip. I like pairing with eth-lad, but wanna try 1cp very soon.

What is the consensus on duration for 1cp? Do you folks find it quicker coming up AND gliding down, or what?

Hi Guys.


New here.


I am a semi experienced acid user I would say, have tripped somewhere near 20 times.


My standard dose is 2 tabs, then maybe 1 or 2 more after peak. 


Have got tabs from a variety of sources, have had all sorts of strengths but 2 has always been enough to get me properly tripping with proper swimming visuals.


Worth noting that I have no idea on the dosing when I buy.


Have recently really struggled to find any (In Dorset, if you can! Lol), and came across 1cplsd online.


Ordered 5 100ug tabs from Germany and me and my girlfriend did 2 and a half each. We both had the feeling of being on acid, but very little visually. 

Everything was bright and hazy, but very little patterns or movement. 


Had expected to trip as hard as usual and was very underwhelmed. It felt like what I imagine 1 to 1 and a half average lsd tabs(from what I have tried) would feel like, but have never done such a small dose.


Do I need to take 5 because what I am used to is obviously much or is 1cplsd just not going to give me what I am looking for? Wary of buying more now.

Welcome to BL, Billc2691!

Sounds like you were used to getting strongly dosed tabs, maybe at a guess I’d say 125-150ug per. You also mentioned eating more after the peak - another factor.

Try 3 next time, or add some cannabis to the mix.


If you’re lacking visuals, try ETH-LAD! It’s a similar substance, generally accepted as slightly more visual or at least differently visual.

But vendor tabs are standardly 100ug or 125 for heavier molecules like 1B-LSD, etc.

Some (albeit rare in some parts) street tabs go as high as 250, but you should get vizzies from 100-150.


Set and setting can be another factor, maybe the most important.

Dark room, or blinds down and some great tunes can make the trip.  Moving around from place to place, wandering, sometimes gives me less visual trips than when I remain in one setting for the duration - like the mind gets bored so creates more to look at.


Also worth noting there is a fair bit of variance in the tabs (+/-15% maybe).


Good luck with the next batch and keep on trippin’. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Billc

I think DrumTripper is onto something about variance in tabs as well as the potential for your normal tabs to be heavily laid.... also was your trip at night or during the day? I find I get less visuals during the day


I do think there is a metabolic factor at play here as well. Some ppl seem to react quite favourably to the analoges, with little discernible differences between them and lsd. While some of us have high hopes with less than spectacular results, at times. 


My 200ug exp was a bit of a let down as well. 300 combined with some dxm and cannabis blew my mind tho... lol ... so combos are always an option if you want to try again and you’re comfortable. But as DT mentioned maybe just increase the dose a bit 5 is a huge jump from 2.5

As a bit of a diversion, there was an interesting paper recently that suggested that blotters that were produced by spraying blotter paper with a solution [may indeed have "hot spots" with higher concentration than the remainder of the paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/dta.2751). The study used blotters with a mix of 25C-NBOMe and 25I-NBOMe but the principle should hold for any drug delivered on blotter.


So that may be responsible for a small amount of variance in experiences, at least with sprayed blotter. I imagine soaked blotters would have a little more consistent dose.

Interesting indeed. I hope we don’t mind some more digression lol.. Now I don’t have many trials with any of the analogues. I have the most with 1a (ald 52), and likely not enough to draw any definitive conclusions, but with multiple attempts at 200ug I’ve had considerably variable results across various sets/settings.... and in my readings I see a number of ppl reporting such variations


So I think Billc would be risqué to jump from 2.5 to 5 unless you’re prepared for the possibility of deep space travel lol ...

I thought the 300 mic 1cp dose i did tonight puts the equivalent dose of 1p-lsd or ALD 52 to shame I have done sheets of those 2 and 1cp-lsd is to me a clear winner of the 3. I never tried 1b-LSD. 

So this shit is some chemistry accident drug  accident with no history or anything i'm used to TIHKAL journal entries or something, any chance I'm going to giving myself brain damage buying a few sheets, its hard to gauge risk of something that didn't exist last year.

Well I tried my ALD2 thursday night for the first time ever. 200ug plus 30ug 1cP-LSD.


I was already insanely wasted on kava, cannabis edibles/vapor plus etizolam ( which doesn't seem to kill or diminish my trips ),  so 230ug at 11.15pm.


It didnt smack me in my face. The ALD come up and peak was surprisingly smooth.


It was well well messy. I took a load more Kava right after the acid combo.


Then hit some powerful Durban Poison in the digital Herbotizer Ti vaporizer. Very strong vape. 


I tried going to bed, less than 2 hours in, partly as an exoeriment lol, partly cos I was so hammered and tired. I was also highly stressed out that evening, hence my spontaneous wild abandon!


Sleeping didn't really work. So I got up, that is when I hit the Durban Poison actually. At about t +2 hours in.


Still, the ALD peak was gentle enough. Not overwhelming but very pleasurable. 

But it wasn't really until yesterday Friday day time when I had to haul myself up after a very short nap to attend an appointment at my job centre with my mum driving me there.


I took a very strong cup of cannabis tea on the way to the Jobcentre and boy when I sat in that building at 3:15 p.m. which was 16 hours after dosing I was absolutely off my head not so much visually but certainly the world had a very different appearance like an Alice in Wonderland type reality.


The cannabis tea I misjudged the dose and took a pretty huge dose straining it from leftover Herb and lecithin bundle in muslin from making edibles.


The tea massively boosted the trip. Actually it was pretty uncomfortable feeling so totally wasted and head blown but quite fascinating and scintillating at the same time.


It was exactly 4 hours from when I drag myself up to my alarm somehow at 1 p.m.to get washed and manage my allergies, to the time when I was finally back home and able to rest on my bed free to my own devices again at 5 pm.


Those 4 hours seems more like 4 days and I experienced the most significant time dilation I have done for many years much more so than I have been with significantly higher doses of 1cp LSD.


Minutes seems like hours. My head was really out there and very altered. The experience was also surprisingly long lasting and I was completely off my head in a highly altered headspace for the rest of the day and evening.


I topped up with 75 ug of 1cp LSD yesterday early evening which instantly affected me and brought me back up and kept the trip going again to prevent me crashing before I could eat.  I took loads more kava as well, which really potentiates and boosts the lysergamides.


So, regarding potency of ALD vs 1P vs 1cP....I would agree with [@Viraldrome](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/503341/) above, 1cP is much stronger than 1p IME.


But my 200ug ALD, plus 30ug 1cP, after a 13ug 1cP microdose earlier on, was a very impactful, interesting, somewhat mind bending, magical and very long lasting experience.


ALD definitely keeps going longer than both 1p and 1cP.


One of my best trips for long time. I was out of my comfort zone yesterday which I kind of like because that's where the excitement is with psychedelics for me. 


230ug on top of 13ug, was easily as full and deep a psychedelic experience as I have had over past 13 months since discovering the clearnet lysergamides last January.


Only 13 ALD tabs left. No more on the horizon. I like it. Definitely different to tne others. More of a mental trip.


I also have 5 220ug plus legit Californian sunrise tabs refrigerated since last February. I haven't taken lsd-25 itself for at least 7 years now.


Regarding the discussion about hotspots and inaccurately dosed tabs, or high levels of variation.... of course I respect all of you guys and your own experience and intuition but in my experience I have not felt that there has been any significant noticeable variation in the potency from tab to tab. 


Effects have seemed very consistent but I'm certainly not ruling it out but at the same time I do believe that there are so many other factors mental and physical which would make the same dose significantly harder or weaker hitting depending on the timing and occasion.


10% variation is likely Im sure.


So [@tired of crap](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/131794/)  200ug ALD could be 180ug, or 220ug by that margin. That in itself would be a significant difference.

I’ve had trips turn sour when on the verge of a flu or food poisoning incident. Those times were nasty and I blamed the substance; in retrospect, those were the times i was dehydrated or full of garbage food. Not suggesting that is your case, but one could reflect on that and prepare for next time. But we are all different. I find ALD-52 the smoothest, then 1p, then 1cp, then ETH-LAD. Seems most others prefer 1cp to 1p by the slightest of margins, but we’re all different and different at different times fir various reasons. 

For example, I puked 7 times on one of my eth-lad trips, swore it was the lad, swore never to drop it again, but have found subsequent trips with it (when i got my nerve back to drop) to be perfect. But that puke fest was due to going all day at work in the heat with no food or water break, then dropping at the end of the day, tired and dehydrated.

When I’m prepared physically and mentally, it’s little or no issue.


Point being, maybe wait a bit, and try a small dose (25-33ug) on a GREAT day, with all your bodily needs well oiled and report back. I’m hoping, and suggesting, that it’ll be a better trip. 


But we’re all different; your body might hate the cyclo-propyl version.

Best to you and your future trips! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I find the duration in the same ballpark as the other 1X-LSD compounds I have tried. Maybe 1a felt a bit longer than the others but I haven't had it in a while. The total come-up time of 1cp is similar to 1p. The difference is I feel the first effects sooner and then it builds up gradually. With 1p it seems like I feel no effects at all for a while and then it hits all at once very fast as soon as I start feeling something.

So I took 3/4 tab 1cP 9pm last night immediately after a couple hours deep sleep. Moderate glass of kava. One more hour plus after. Went for a night time walk to collect some chapattis.


By 2 hours, I had come up very noticeably. I hit 4 big vaporizer hits of a very hallucinogenic outdoor sativa plant.   The effects were very good. Not overwhelming, not at all undsrwhelming.  Followed by bigger kava dose plus 1mg Etizolam.


More than my 50ug trips, despite a similar dose the previous day which was another insane trip. I was very happy with the dose. Not wishing I had taken more.


Head has been sent into a very bad place due to mega high household stress with my mum, both have been ill, possibly corona but we have amazing, life saving alternative remedies, approaches, and devices to very quickly knock out any type of infection, or at least lower it by 80% plus in only a day.


I just took another whole tab at 2 am, feeling gradually more settled. The 75ug mellowed out so I thought of a 50ug top up. But then thought, heck it eat the other half as well.


Redosing ALWAYS works for me. While I am still awake and the acid is still there. Just to make the initial dose worthwhile in many hours to come, lingering tomorrow rather than tapering down and being obscured by my Kava.


I drank another strong glass of Kava with the 2am 100ug tab.


So, 1cP continues to work very well for me, however often I trip, on all doses. I genuinely do not seem to be building a tolerance and I can access the full tripping headspace with visual effects and the whole magical universe aspect it seems any time I am up for it.


And I've recklessly been taking at least some 1cp LSD most days whether it's 15 micrograms, 25, 30, or 50 or above.


I swear there must be something different about my own physiology or brain chemistry or maybe there is a mind over matter spiritual aspect whereby certain vastly journey souls like myself, can simply tap into deep hallucinogenic experiences at virtually any time and frequency simply using the substance as a Trigger. 


Anyway besides the fact I have been in the most terribly depressed mindset where I really do not want to be alive anymore because of general living situations in life suffering and more, I have to say the 1cp LSD has been again very pleasant and enjoyable and smooth this evening.


I think that is all I have to say for now folks but wishing you all well! Im not planning more acid now, but enough prepared kava waits on tap for when I am ready to access a deeper, more care-free relaxed state in some hours.  I expect cannabis edibles will accompany kava.  


[@Drum](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/158350/) Tripper hello mate. Always very much appreciate and enjoy hearing your non-arrogant, open minded and experienced flexible take and views on all things.


You always add great perspective and give the soundest most considerate advice.


Btw guys- newsletter from the producers concerning the expected upcoming Dutch ban on research chemicals there will be many products mainly stimulants disappearing from production but the lysergamides and tryptamines will remain unaffected so that's fantastic news for now anyway.

By 30 minutes in, the 100ug redose is coming on fully enough. None of this....after 1 hour it will do nothing. I am officially going to throw that bullshit out of the window in my own case and experience, but I realise I may be unique here.

[@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) I’m wondering if this is true for you for other lysergamides, or if this effective-redosing is more unique to 1cp?

I found the only time i got a noticeable bump from after-peak redosing was when i added eth-lad to a 1p trip (now that i can navigate that combo).

We must all be slightly different with regard to uptake, absorption, metabolism, etc. and this has got me curious. Not that i need an excuse to try it out for myslf, bu just wondering your thoughts on that. Cheers

Hello mate. Yes I'm certainly open to that consideration regarding 1cp in particular.


But I also believe in anomalies and exceptions.  I do truly believe that the way my own brain chemistry and consciousness and biology are working and perhaps this is related to my general lifestyle and supplement usage in particular high dosage of vitamin C ascorbic acid which I have a sneaking intuitive suspicion may actually very quickly reset tolerance as well as potentiate the lysergamide experience, may play a factor here as well in resetting my tolerance much faster or perhaps even preventing it from developing anywhere near as quickly.


But my poly drug use will also possibly play a role. Regular edibles in high doses, and daily kava for many months now.


And I was discussing this with my good friend and member here [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/) who like myself has been extremely far out for many years on the deepest psychedelic experiences and whose personality and brain chemistry is radically reformed as a result and he also experiences consistent and strong effects from all sorts of doses and shares my feelings on how he can on trip very regularly without tolerance being a Factor or a problem and still get completely out there on low doses like 70 ug.


I think consciousness comes into this whole tolerance Factor more than we realise and take for granted and I think the way that our own unique minds and brains operate can determine whether we can tap into and access the experience as well.


All I know is I have been taking some sort of dose virtually every day for many months and I still get consistent and noticeable and worthwhile effect from literally any dose like 10 ug will be effective and 25 ug will actually give me visuals and a come up.


If I took 200ug right now I would have a full and and Powerful and immersive trip with full visual effects I have no doubt.  I honestly think high dose ascorbic acid may be at play here though, on the bioilogical level.


But I do certainly think that 1cp LSD may be slightly different in how tolerance does not develop so quickly or as much. 


Mind over matter too, not, consciously, but as a result of conscioysness expansion and rewired brain chemistry.


Heavy heavy ecstasy abuse also, 3500 e's from 96 to 2005, massive brain and consciousness alteration- maybe this is another factor.


Yes Lyme Disease is a bitch. It totally destroyed my life, immune system and messed up my nervous system, to this day, 15 years on.


I cleared the actual underlying biologically engineered borrelia bacteria several years ago but lyme disease is not an infection it is a condition as a result of the neurological bacteria and I define lyme disease as "immune and nervous system dysregulation" which is so difficult to correct it could be considered as virtually incurable for many people.   


I just live with it and do the best I can but I'm just fighting to survive and have the best life quality and least amount of suffering I can every single day unable to travel or partake in any leisurely activities just essential survival necessities really with as much fun and Hobby as I can squeeze in to keep my Focus and motivation and sanity but it really is an incredibly grinding and difficult way to live with the most severe allergies and intolerances you could possibly imagine and such a heavily compromised immune system I am permanently fighting multiple chronic infections.


I have had at least two infections in my lungs every single day simultaneously since 2005 at least answer the majority of the time it is between 4 and 6 infections at a time.


I can treat and clear every single infection but I contract new infections at the same rate so it's like treading water in a vicious circle with such a high degree of suffering.


Covid19 is 1000 percent a man-made biological organism by the way not like a natural annual flu. I'm almost certain the cat will come out of the bag soon regarding this one they won't be able to keep a lid on it for much longer the established lying Media controlled by the Elite.


It was released by accident but is not nearly as fatal as it was intended to be it was designed to have a very high infection rate which was then to be paired with another virus whic has a much higher fatality rate but there was an accidental release in China it was intended to be released in America to bring down Donald Trump who is the hugest Thorne and hurdle the elites have had to deal with for many years regarding their plans for depopulation and total global control.


So we were actually very lucky for this outbreak and I do believe that lots of good will come up out of this and that some very good actions are taking place behind the scenes now regarding the fight between the Good and Evil elites battling for control and order on this planet.


Phrases like "nature fighting back" are just ridiculous IMO. I find it staggering that people can't logically see and accept that this is very clearly a biologically engineered organism there is tons of evidence that these organisms have been biologically engineered for a very long time. AIDS is man made. Lyme Disease too, unquestionably.  Too many sick minded, evil psychopaths out there in this world with technology and means beyond your average mind controlled persons capacity for belief.

It’s why we were given acid - a molecule of hope!

I feel you, [@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) and think allot of the same things.

The way our govs are reacting feels too proscribed, and protracted.

The elites need to be thumb-printed or something, a good re-wiring.


One thing I also agree with is your mention of intentionality and tolerance; will plays a role, major or minor depending on the person.

I remember taking another hit on several occasions and getting another peak, more viz, and an extended trip. Most swear that the only effect is lengthening the trip, but it may come down to individual traits, diets, chemistry, and usage. I’m no neuro-scientist, but until they do thousands of trials to fully explore this stuff, no one can simply refute anything, really.


Trip on, fish on . . .

Yes regarding re dosing being effective for me personally I usually am maintaining the psychedelic and psychoactive buzz and experience for a prolonged period without it becoming deactivated or me detaching from it and returning to normal thinking processes and I find that not only does it extend the experience but it also can bring about a shift into a slightly different or higher mindset as my mind is so deep and probing and really far out there anyway it's like an additional dose at anytime can have different effects to which it may have for somebody who's tripping experiences are totally unlike my own and much more grounded.

Ok just got another 5 strip in the mail and immediately dropped a 1/4 tab.

Fast forward 4.5 hours and this is the strongest 1/4 tab I;ve ever taken. Feels like 50ug of 1p or like 40ug eth-lad.

Suuuuuper smooth comeup, but food was tough to finish.

No body load at all, and my fuck, is this visual!

Just now rounding the peak, and feeling relieved.

I’m getting mild patterning and old-school breathing/melting if I stare for 20 seconds or so.

Never did I ever have 25ug kick so hard! Like, I don’t really need to go past this level.

Must be down to freshness. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yeah my plug uses a pipette and simply squirts solution over the sheets of a known solution and tries to make it even? but even so often i hit a very strong hot spot which sends me flying across the universe.

Im wondering how potent 1cp is in relation to accurate dosed LSD. I know 50 ug will induce noticeable visuals on lsd 100-105 ug accurate been a medium trip with very noticeable heavy psychedelica reality morphing. 150 ug been a heavy acid trip where objects can fully transform and block out the real world with visuals so strong you will be flying high and ego death under the right settings can happen. 250 ug is extremely strong if acutally dosed right very little contact left with the real world at this point sinking deep into the mind peoples faces will be morphing into all sorts of crazy stuff on this level. 


I assume 1cp is the same dosage strength as LSD or even a bit more potent. Prodrugs to LSD should be the purest form of LSD to be taken given you what true LSD-25 100% purity should feel like. No body load very strong visuals and sober like clarity thoughts allowing people to come up with very new novel ideas and creative thinking.

Yes 1cP fits this bill and descriptiin exactly regarding doses and general effects and experience.  I actually believe my tabs are all pretty consistently and accurately dosed.

 I'm almost certain they have a different way of laying the tabs compared to your friend I mean they are going to be as professional as you can get and consistency would be one of their primary Focuses and objectives.


50ug is a good trip, with visuals, bright neon colour, headspace and insights.  Please bear with me mate I will get back to your Q in pm about LSD's healing powers. Just very tough right now, beaten down by illness and stress and low energy.


[@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/)  that is what my 1/4  tabs feel like. Do you use cannabis? If so, try combining that dose with a Cannabis edible which really bumps it up into something even more significant and longer lasting.  25ug of 1cP is surprisingly strong and adequate.

Yes, daily! But this tine, I was so shocked that I waited until around 6 hours in. Then . . . liftoff again. I actually purged at hour 5.5 and felt better after. Then vaped some serious Sweet Cheezus. Sleep was easy at 10 hours.

If that’s a 1/4 tab, I’m either shifting into a light-weight or just getting old, or hypersensitive. I never got such OEV and CEV from anything under 75ug, and this was supposed to be 1/3 that amount. I believe it’s like [@TripSitterNZ](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/521610/) said with the laying of sheets. I almost think vendors may be more rushed with the volume of material they’re pushing out, even though they’re professional. Or are they? They’re not exactly Sandoz, after all. Takes very little, beyond money and a couple permits to set up an RC distro.


I don’t remember getting such a variance in street tabs, but we never really knew what we were getting in ug. And I’d always drop a double!

I think small doses exhibit more surprise if they exceed expectations; like dropping a double, you know you’re in for it - but a 1/4 kicking your ass can be a little . . . woah.

Still super happy today and bristling with energy.

#1 Lysergamide for me, i think!

With respect, there are no logical grounds to play down or even mock the wonderful reality of such very pure lab grade lysergamides being available at button click.


This should never be taken for granted in my opinion and when 1plsd first came out it was fully legal in the United Kingdom, Where the global manufacturers were also based in this country before moving to Holland after the 2016 research chemical ban came into force.


I wasn’t absolutely certain of your meaning but I assume you do not particularly rate 1PLSD and feel that maybe it is overhyped and overrated in which case why be so excited about a slightly different newer version.


That is just what I assumed you meant anyway because you hardly elaborated LOL and it’s nice when posters can actually be mindful enough to make the meaning clear and obvious enough for others to understand.


It can sometimes come across as slightly flippant or disrespectful otherwise.  Let’s call it common courtesy.


But anyway the only point I wanted to really make apart from the fact that this is a privilege not to be taken for granted, Is that in my consistent experience and the majority of reports from others the More recently released 1cP-LSD is a notable step up from 1PLSD in terms of potency certainly, above  all but also inTerms of sheer enjoyment capacity.   Many people have said that they like it just as much as original LSD 25 or even prefer it to that so I don’t think there are any legitimate grounds to semi-mock Somebody being excited to receive this compound and try it for the first time regardless of anybody’s particular feelings or experiences with 1plsd.


Just wanted to make those important points and distinctions I don’t mean to challenge or rebutt you My friend and I am sorry if I totally mistake your meaning altogether but it would be nice if people would make their meanings just that little bit clearer when they post here as the most of us do our best to ensure.

sounds like a hot spot, but it is so nice when you hit it.


also have to admit, 1p is less lovely, tho I am **very **appreciative of it, 1cp seems more refined, but the hotspots rule!!

Also, [@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) and the more I think about it even more valid and logical, when we are talking about hotspots I mean we are only guessing and intuiting really but then we could possibly make a distinction between hotspots over the sheet which is what I think people commonly assume when this is mentioned....


And then hot spots on individual tabs. So all I was thinking is that using the microdosing volumetric method, at least that chance would be eliminated because all you need to do is shake the bottle up before you use it.


If we felt strongly that the hotspots were more of an issue on individual tabs vs certain parts of a sheet then volumetric liquid dosing would make perfect sense and be a solution for consistent dosing and effects from individual tabs.


Anyway, [@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) I'm really glad you had a very positive and enjoyable day and experience and the more I hear from you the more I feel that you are a man after my own heart right on with the vaporizing some lovely weed to kick those effects back up.


I have been on and extended vaporizing break for recent months just dealing with illnesses and finding other ways to manage my need for medication and intoxication, with regular daily edibles, but that is exactly what I would do myself. Vape some lovely weed as soon as my mini peak had settled out into pure serenity and calm, where everything is brilliant and appreciable and I can't imagine there being a single problem or anxiety in life.


And vaping on top of edibles and miniature acid doses you don't need nearly as much vapor, and get so high with such an enhancement of the colour effects, plus the manic, racy mindset depending how much weed you vape and when,


20ug for myself tonight, but tons of Kava and herb edibles too.


I took 3mg Etizolam since rising at 4pm (3.15am here now), and honestly I feel the 20ug we just like any other day and certainly noticeable and effective.


I have been taking 25ug previous days starting with 15 which is a nice stimulating effect which helps with my fatigue from long-term sleep deprivation and general anxiety and depression as well and then topping up with a 10 ug dose an hour or two later.


But I have been finding that the 10 ug top up increases to strength to be much more noticeable in a way that I didn't need or appreciate at the time in combination with the heavy kava buzz.


So tonight I I unexpectedly followed my 15 ug dose with a 5 ug top-up which has not have the same slightly unwanted increased effects but feels just about right for intents and purposes.


Be well guys.

Ya [@Viraldrome](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/503341/) there is no doubt to me its action is markedly stronger - and don’t hate on me for this - but maybe clearer/cleaner feeling.

[@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) I haven’t mixed with edibles yet, but have some strong tincture to add to the party next time. Do you eat yours before the ’cid or after?

Yes try it man. Same time works, or cid first edibles within an hour. Or edibles just before. The comup time on both is similar, edibles a bit quicker arguably. I cant say what is most common for me, Im highly felxible, spontaneous and unplanned usually, driven by my changeable and unpredictable stormy mind and general mental disposition.

Yes do it mste, that's the spirit. I swear, in my experience anyway, they really accelerate each other.  And then when you bring in the vapor, such a little puts you immediately up there, but so tranquilly though.


It's like you've had a full dose of acid practically, or equivalent, but different.


Using low acid dose to really accelerate and potentiates the hallucinogenic effects of weed in general.  Even vaping on top of edibles is way more hallucinogenic than either method by itself. 


I don't have any access to tinctures and would not tolerate them anyway, so I've just use our home infused coconut oil.


My Mum made a fresh batch yesterday from our strongest plant ever and it really did blow my head off last night on top of loads of kava and other edibles plus the acid.

Anyone know how long 1cp-lsd would stay potent in storage. Would it be similar to regular LSD, or would the 1cp part of it make it more volatile?

Funny, that was not my experience at all. I've only take 1CP once so far, but it felt at most 1.2 times the potency of 1P-LSD. Not even close to 2X.

I don't really notice any difference in potency compared to ALD-52 (macrodosing). Possibly 10-20% stronger based on my experiences microdosing (1/9th) of 100 mcg blotter - though I never manage to cut it up in exactly the same size. So differences may as well be because of that.

[@PsychedelicSummer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/469523/) try volumetric dosing for greater accuracy. Use distilled water, measure out say 10mm, add your desired tabs, calculate the per mm dose.

And I agree, it does seem to be more potent than 1p, by how much I can’t tell, but my 12.5 mcg micros are much more noticeable in 1cp than 1p.

Just as stable and preservable as LSD 25 I would strongly expect.


I have had unfridged tabs in my bedroom draw for a year, no noticeable degradation.


Honestly, all of these LSD homologues, and mum herself, are remarkabky stable and long lasting, just dont overexpose them to the culprits- heat, light, moisture, oxygen...

ALD is very underrated IMO. I only ever had one experience with it (yet, I have another precious 13 tabs fridged up), months back, 200ug ALD plus 30ug 1cP.  It was one of my most impactful trips ever, and so long lasting. It was a wonderful experience, in the end lol!  All's well that ends well, right?


I don't expect I will ever get any more ALD 52, but if my faithful Dutch manufacturer/supplier started making it again, I wouldn't hesitiate to try and grab a large sheets's worth.

Hey my good friend. Always your advice is good, clear, insightful and accurate.


But I just feel need to emphasise the vital point here- with distilled water at least, there is far less than 100% dissoltion of acid from the paper tabs into the water.


It shocked me on 2 occasions, when I simply rinsed out empty bottles with 2 tabs in 1/4s.


I had been getting consistent, and suffucient effects from Syringing my doses.


But these tab pieces knocked me for 6. I had a full tripping experience the first time,  it was basically everything I know LSD to be and it totally put me out of action for the entire day and the world was a crazy place.


I was expecting possibly another microdose worth up to 20 ug but honestly it felt significantly stronger than a half tab like 65 ug or more.


But when it comes to volumetric microdosing this way I don't think it matters as long as you can experiment with millilitres of liquid and find what works best for you then if you are brave enough to swallow the tabs at the end you could be in for a stronger and deeper psychedelic experience.


I just prefer to know exactly what dose I'm taking of anything generally but that's OCD me lol.


Edit- just edited a dozen typos. Please excuse me that in general. It's not just wasted Ness, but I picked up some damage to my optic nerve in 2016 and it has permanently affected my ability to be Sharp and on the ball when posting and spelling on the internet.


But I can't deny that being pretty Hamid on various psychoactives does not contribute as well haha!

And I agree, now that you pointed it out, that at least it gives you a more graduated approach vs slicing tabs into tiny slivers.

And you’re left with a treat at the end. I will try it now! My eth-lad tabs are mostly in solution, when i get to the end of the dropper, I will drop those soggy tabs and report back. I never would have thought! Thanks for explaining that, I feel silly not ever just thinking that naturally.

I put slivers of 20 tabs into a measured amount of distilled water (80 squeezed droppers full).

shook it up... thereafter for 1/4 tab I took one dropper's worth embracing the floaty bits of tabs.

I always shake prior to withdrawing a full dropper (actually a full dropper of one squeeze looks half full).

the paper still has good stuff in it. My whole purpose of doing this was to avoid hotspots and duds.


for microdoses I squeeze out half back into the bottle getting ~1/8 tab.

First time I took LSD was in Amsterdam almost 30 years ago. We had bought blotters with smileys on them and were warned they were very strong and to not take more than a half. Being cautious and worried the acid wasn't evenly distributed, I took half a tab and put in a glass of beer and let it sit for about an hour. Than me and a friend split the beer. A third friend for some reason ate the paper left in the glas. It resulted in that all three of us tripped and had a glorious time. 


Trying to go to sleep much to early in a bunk bed doorm room with people we'd never met, we couldn't resist laughing listening to the severe snoring of our fourth friend. In a short time the strangers also started to laugh and we all lay there laughing hysterically for a long time. From the strength of the effect I estimate I must have gotten at least 40 mcg, so the tabs were at least over 250 mcg! 


Good that I didn't eat a hole. Slightly more on topic, does anyone know if tabs will release the acid better in alcohol or by letting them sit in water for a long time? If I understand you right Pupnik, your tabs stored in water still contain more acid than may be expected?

This has just revived a memory for me, which was truly fascinating to learn about at the time because it really opened my mind to what is possible in a non-material and mind over matter purely consciousness sense.


But when I was 17 I'm 40 years old now my slightly older cousin with more experience was telling me very legitimately how when two people out of 3 people take LSD, the third person usually trips as well.


It's the same sort of phenomena which enables the amazing experience I had myself many times of group k holes on ketamine literally group hallucinations, fully conscious of ourselves and remembering and sharing the experiences afterwards.


Now I'm not disputing at all that there was a substantial amount of that LSD left in the paper tab in the empty beer glass but I just wanted to point out that this phenomena genuinely does exist in my belief.

Just to answer your last question I can't tolerate any form of alcohol myself due to severe allergies but I would bet good money that you would get a better and faster and more thorough dissolution from the paper of the LSD into alcohol vs distilled water just going by my recent experience with distilled water and intuition.

You shouldn't use water. How long is that supposed to last? You should use everclear, if not available, 151 proof.

oh, well, **chlorinated water is not good **for the molecule but distilled water is fine. That is why I don't use tap water.

this kit is 1 year old, and will soon be refilled, maybe 1/20th is left.

I just got some more distilled water. blotters are in drawer. Next month I'll mixitup.


Not sure about the materials being shown in the photo above , but I can read 5 yr old LSD over the nothing warped paper below the glowing blue circle, really I can't make out what is happening, what format was the acid, how was it stored, etc.


did they use tap water?

I must agree with [@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) I honestly don't think distilled water is an issue at all.


As he rightly emphasises, non filtered chlorinated tap water is obviously not recommended with LSD.


For us to get any closer to some objectivity on this however, we really need more precise details- the exact type of water used, and all other storage conditions, i.e. heat and light exposure. 


But, regardless, [@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) , myself and others are not attempting to store LSD in any water or liquid for long periods. My MD bottles barely last me a week, let alone 30-40 days for a typical, disciplined Microdose programme.


Good point on the oxygen component of the water. But we really cannot know if the oxygen degrades the LSD in water, as a part of the water, the same as it does in open air.


That is a seperate question.


And yes, I agree that alcohol like Everclear would be better, not possibly just to minimise degradation, but if using tabs then possibly also a faster and more complete dissolution of the LSD from the paper into the alcohol, vs distilled water.

had 1/2 blotter 1cp yesterday and tripped hard enough to declare 50 mics a great level. alone in locked down condo, wife at locked down hair salon masked all day getting hair streaked while I was having my thoughts and sensations streaked over time. she was gone 6 hours and i tripped for 12.


anyway my distilled water potion (which is 1p+al-lad) still has strong measurable doses after 18 months.

The main point of adding alcohol to the water (20% or greater concentration) is to prevent microbial growth during storage.

Yes, alcohol will work - many millions of blotters arelaid using vodka. It’s made with distilled water, or should be free of chlorine anyway.

The critical point is knowing the ratio of lsd to alcohol. Micrograms per millilitre.

Put a sliced up tab into 5 ml, and you should have 20 mcg per ml, assuming a 100 mcg tab. Whatever ratio you choose is up to you. Do you want potent or gentle juice?

If microdosing, it’s prolly the later.

getting it all off the paper is another thing. therefore I recommend cutting the paper into tiny bits and including them as part of the medicine in your dropper after shaking the bottle.

So far i tried this at

25mcg - perfect for every social occasion where relative clearheadedness is expected. 

37,5mcg - 50mcg - perfect for walks. Id even call 50 a decent, although mild, trip. 

75mcg - i loved the walk, girlfriend had some thought loops, no lasting problems. 

100mcg - positive, intense, at the peak it was difficult to operate scales. I asked my sober friend to weigh the MDMA. Wonderful combo, looking at clouds, very positive body high. Droppes the mdma 4,5-5hours after the 1cplsd. Felt great the next day and weeks. 


I love this compound. I also love lsd, but i like that this is easier to dose, since i know that a tab is 100mcg. I dont really notice a qualitative difference.

Hey


could anyone compare the potency of 1-cP to ALD-52 which i guess should be metabolized to LSD almost instantly afaik and in any case seems indistinguishable from LSD in every way if you ask me...


and what is the timeline like / the kinetics? Are they peculiar and different from LSD or quite similar? Maybe this could allude a bit to whether 1-cP moiety just interacts very favorably with plasma esterases or instead makes a big difference for factors like absorption and distribution?


And while not the right thread for it, 1B is just more expected and less potent is it not? I thought 1P would also in most people take longer not shorter, to come up and more of it may get degraded before getting a chance to dissociate and act? Puzzling. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I can't help feel also, that the alcohol usage, especially higher concentration like vodka or above ( my Mum's choice ha ha ), may increase the release and dissolution of the acid into the alcohol vs distilled water because I have found on numerous occasions that those dried out leftover tab pieces are enough to blast Me To The Moon like 50 to 60 micrograms worth I swear left in two tabs worth.


So I may be wrong but I just assumed that alcohol especially something like ever clear may Leach a higher percentage of the compound out of the tabs.


So when I measure what should be 10 micrograms I just need to be mindful that actually it is a little less.


[@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) yes indeed, 50 ug can be a very worthwhile and significqnt experience.  It is just about my favorite dose, from low to high recent times. Glad you enjoyed it as much as I have anyway mate.

MDMD and LSD together is magical. My fave drug combo of all time, with moderate good weed throughout.


A nice few beers the following night can be lovely too.

[@Solipsis](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/91690/) 

I only have limited experience with 1a, less with 1cP and only one (higher dose) attempt with 1P. None with 1B


Set and setting are obviously critical. As is Roa, if we are to believe that these drugs are metabolized via the liver to LSD. 


What strikes me is that in recent studies, in rodents (?rats?), it’s been shown that these are in fact prodrugs to lsd. Yet they have different binding affinities, depending on the substitution.


To me that would be indicative of different effect profiles. Yet some people can’t differentiate between 1subs and lsd. 


I have only ever tried these 1 subs sublingually. With my limited experience I have noticed differences in come up, effects and to a lesser extent, duration -both between them and compared to LSD.


While the duration of all the 1subs I’ve tried seem shorter than lsd (exactly how much differs between them and is difficult for me to pin down as I’ve often comboed 1a and 1cP) they all seem To have a duration of 8-10 hrs; depending on dose, combo etc. 


As for effects, 1a seems to come on slower and be more “gentle”, comparatively. 


1P hit me hard and fast, and provided me with more of what id consider an lsd headspace (plenty of thought loops and over analyzation). Yet something seemed to be missing from the experience.


1cP seemed to be more rich than 1P. It doesn’t seem quite as smooth, physically, as 1a. Mentally it seemed in between the rushy faster paced 1P and the calmer 1a. 


Potency seemed comparable across all trials, ignoring outliers. As it would seem I’m not the only one to notice variations between tabs (specifically 1a). Relative to lsd it’s difficult for me to compare as I’ve always had a hard time believing the supposed ug


I would be willing and am curious to try oral doses, to seee if there were any discernible differences in these areas

[@Solipsis](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/91690/): I'd be unable to differentiate between ALD-52 & 1cP-LSD. The few differences I notice I ascribe to normal differences due to set & setting and natural variances in metabolism.

From my experience 1p and ald has a better potency dropped with food than sublingual.

Usually I take them just before eating. I know this is not always a good idea but I'm not really a puking guy and I'm rather thin so I need some reserves.

Potency wise personally 1p < ald (can't compare with street lsd for obvious reasons). Quality wise even if there might have some differences I always find them greatly enjoyable on their own and my best trip ever was with 1p but set and settings was probably the main reason.

I have a very limited experience with 1cP, I tried 2 100µ tabs but I took them after the meal. It took ages to come up. It was fine but a bit weak for my taste (1 usually take 2.5 1P or 2 ald).The duration was longer than usual.

So from my experience, food and metabolism is an important factor in the experience with analogues and it's the main difference I can tell with good old lsd which isn't sensible to those things.

Yes man, so  nice to hear a longtime psychonaut's observations from experience on these matters because I I absolutely swear there is a noticeable difference between the different homologues and I generally agree with what you have said above except I want to point out that for me and according to to pretty much all literature as well I believe ALD 52 to actually lasts longer than LSD 25 in general.


I only took ALD 52 once as you know so so far but I certainly experienced a surprisingly prolonged trip which came down so gently that I practically had a second peak after some cannibal edibles 16 hours after dosing 200ug + 30 ug of 1cp LSD.


And I was due at the Jobcentre at the exact same time lol that was interesting a real shock at just how far out there I still was.


But yes also, 1p- for me and many, hard and fast comeon.


Took 200ug Last January, 1st trip in 6 years. Man I barely had time to sit down before it was coming on strongly I was expecting an hour and a half of gradually starting to feel the effects while I carried on deeply relaxing and focusing on a positive experience lol!


1cP is more subtle for me. It rises in intensity.  Smoother than 1P   for me too. But I also agree fully with your observations of the ALD 52 come up being more gradual and smooth vs 1cp LSD with that one being in between the two others discussed here.


And very interestingly this is exactly the pattern which was demonstrated when I took these three lysergamides to my homeopath to be Vega tested to see how smooth and beneficial they were to my own particular body.


I was pretty damn sure before what the exact order and somehow intuitively of the ratio which was Spot On and the largest gap was between the ALD 52 and the 1cp LSD which was a a fair bit ahead of the 1plsd, which was not terrible by any means.


So I just think it's interesting how your exact own experience matches my own and the Vega testing indications on these three in particular.

Hey, very interesting also and thanks for sharing personally I find 1cp LSD to be noticeably more Potent than 1p LSD.


Ald was different to me it was more subtle but it kind of placed me in another dimension which lasted a very long time I'm and turned out to be incredibly enjoyable and therapeutic and healing rather than initially intense come on then come off period.


The really warm fuzzy body parts of large doses of 1cp LSD are really pleasant and amazing and especially kicked up by cannabis vaporization or smoking.


But beware my good friends- cannabis edibles on fairly high doses can be a bit promiscuous lol! Catch you ou like.


Oh yes, [@stanleyK](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/158316/) I personally have founf 1cP to be surprisingly strong and effective at lower doses too.

Yep, just dropped about 20mcg 30 min ago and it is exactly what i wanted today.

I’m loving this one for micros! So smooth and uplifting at this level. ![:cool:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f60e.png)

this is finer grained than ethlad which I found excellent - almost a frothy mental dance - 1cp still frothy but clearer, less soap maybe.


this is very subjective

And I have many say they get much more bodyload with ETH-LAD. But most seem so overjoyed by the visuals it seems almost unimportant.


Never tried it myself. Nor AL-LAD. Just 1p, 1cP and ALD, p,us L of corse biut not for many years now.

I don’t get much body load from ethlad. I’m fact my first experience with 1cP gave me a more uncomfortable body load than either of my exp with eth. 


The dose response curve is def much steeper with eth too. 


This is less visual but provides more headspace. Though my high dose of ethlad was very confusing at times - be careful pushing that one (any drug really, always titrate slowly).

yes, eth-lad can give me a high body temp sometimes, but less so each time.

I’ve become more used to it. Same as 1cp - the first few times, i swore it was mis-laid it seemed so much more potent than 1p.

And with eth-lad, the difference between 100 mcg and 150 mcg is surprising. Don’t go doubling based on experience with another lysergamide.

for micro-dosing I am now using 1cp (cut blotter) rather than 1p+alad (distilled water drops), but using 20 mics instead of 13 mics - it has less of that pushy body load, more mental alertness. I will go for volumetric dosing once I clean my dropper bottle with scores of tiny paper blotter bits stuck to the glass.

Im thinking of combining this with some 4 ho mipt tomorrow. 

200 ug for my first trial was rather uneventful. Decent but a little low for my liking (when attempting an immersive experience).

300 ug with some dxm was other worldly lol ... 


So Im thinking Ill string some lights, get some fire wood and bring out the bluetooth speaker for an end of season/moving session.


Ill likely shoot for 300 ug and depending on how Im feeling 25 mg of 4 ho mipt maybe an hour or so later.

(I combined 200 ug ald 52 with 18 mg 4 ho mipt before and though they blended well it was far from overwhelming)


Will report back

my volumetric 1cp dosing by dropper bottle is very disappointing now. 


I used my new shipment of 1cp blotters, putting in 20 tabs and 80 droppers of distilled water. Now I need two droppers to feel it which either means they were way way underdoped (i.e. ~30 mics not 100 mic tabs). the two droppers should be 50 mics but feels like 15 mics. 


I feel like my second 1cp buy was a bad decision and will only buy pellets from now on. (1p will be fine)

Have you tried the tabs by themselves?

I only say this because I'm not sure of the solubility of 1cp though I would assume it *should* be soluble in h2o .

In my experience I've never used water as a solvent but I have noticed odd soluable properties if various Lysergamides. 

1p is super soluble in isopropyl but ald52 was not and required methanol to dissolve the crystal (this was back in the day when you could still get crystal Lysergamides.

Also, the al lad and eth lad were soluble in anything but it seemed like 1 substituted ones were a bit trickier to get into solution .

LSM-775 seemed to retire both ethanol and water to get into solution.

I'm just curious if 1cp-lsd might have some unusual solubility properties?

My last volumetric was 8 tabs 1p + 12 tabs A-Lad also in distilled water and was much stronger, mostly reflecting the stronger 1p tabs. It was a great mix which led to many good days and evenings. 


I am using the new dropper set faster because it is way weaker.

Okay, I am trying to figure out my own bemusement. As my own expereinces strongly don't match.


(But for record's sake, I have only been using my batch 1, unprinted WoW 1cp tabs direct from Holland.) Haha, I've worked through that 5 bag of 50 neat,,white tabs, at near hand in my bedroom draw.   134 trips in a year abouts, on and off of course.


But 1cP continues to work for me consistently and powerfully.


I respect all you guys, just adding my own solid experience.


[@tired of crap](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/131794/) easy! I took a 200ug dose of my WoW 1cp this week.


Ive tripped an easy 1000 times over decades, mega high 25 doses in past. Like 5 mg literally in 48 hours, rwice. And the rest lol.


My 200ug 1cP trio 3 days ago,  wow, was up there with any. Intense dancing visuals. Really out there, with that frantic, manic feeling full on trips can bring.


But I was drinking kava too,,which wastes me alone and potentiate acid like weed, just less abruptly.


And substantial cannabis edibles- with a 200ug dose, it felt more like 400-600 I swear.


But this is just normal for me and that mere 200ug was a real intense 12 hour rocker.


Maybe I got good tabs? Anyway, [@tired of crap](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/131794/) best wishes fir your trip combo mate. Enjoy and safe tripping!


[@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) easy too mate!  Also full respect and trust in all you reports here and your discerning powers and appreciate your considered objectivity so I don't question what you are saying at all about your current batch of 1cp LSD and your disappointment with it I'm just trying to think of explanations.


I do think what [@Ballz_Trippington](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/301774/) suggests is very worthy of consideration because I have definitely noticed as we discussed before far from complete dissolution from the tabs themselves into the distilled water.


Besides my own 1cp micro dosing Solutions seeming very effective at all doses even as low as 10 ug.


But I certainly think it is possible for the different lysergamides to have a varying water solubility level.


And also it was a good question to ask you if you have tested it with the Direct paper itself because this is always the litmus test ultimately.


I honestly only need a good half-aka 50ug, with cannabis and kava, or jusy one of thos alone , to be on a really wonderful trip in combination with my cannabis and kava habits lol.


My 200ug trip was insane and really impactful, intense. It's actually had me crazy for a bit even the next day which is what I love and seek about it ultimately haha!


But of course you could have picked up a weak batch about for all we know but I would still test the paper itself Direct if you have not or consider using alcohol in future which I cannot tolerate myself at all,, for a better dissolution.


Maybe this batch- more acid was lost from the blotersers during the cutting process for all we know as well,, just occurred to me.


So yeah, [@Ballz_Trippington](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/301774/) udeful inputs for thought and thanks for that.


My own 1cP blows me into the stratosphere every time time, more than my legit 1p!


200ug is a full manic acid trip! 


Interesting about the solubility variability. 


Also to consider is the potential for different batches and and variations in the paper and laying method perhaps accounting for weaker solubility in distilled water.


And...you CAN  still buy, to order, the pure tartrate. From direct gobgal source by contact, for the record. Providing they shipped to your specific country of course.


I also have untested batch 2, first printed 1cP in store from the Germans in August 2019..


If that is equally as good as the first batch then I'm cooking haha!


That's all, just trying to make sense of all of this with total respect to all of you guys and your reported experiences.

Thanks Auto,

I had run a couple trials; my first @200 was rather dull. In combination with dxm, ug 300 was well a mess lol 

Plan was to land somewhere in the middle lol .... 


I may have overshot... I hid feelings of horror and emotional turbulence while the fire carried on.

I rambled over work And finding a new job Something with a pension

But waves of calming washed, as I shook with the energy of the 4 ho mipt...


I couldnt shake the introspection tho 

So we succumb early after many hijink lol... We tried to watch The Opening Act (it was just some random comedy movie on plex (ala netflix))

Well damn it fit so superbly... Everything made sense


Until buddy couldnt take me giggly at a plot he couldnt be assed to follow


So I scribbled a few notes... It became easier with time lol 

I ate and drank and took a capsule of Magnesium for good measure 

Ill have a trip report, of sorts, to follow.

I'm  probably in the minority of people who actually do run legit non-invivo test on my research chems (my research involves determining max solubility or lack thereof in various solvents. 

But I have noticed in my notes that R6 substituted Lysergamides behave very much like LSD25 in terms of solubility. 

But the R1 subbed ones were tricky to get into various solvents. 

I suspect this is because AL-LAD and ETH-LAD are structurally very similar to LSD25  while the R1 subs have a big ass Acytel or Propionyl or cyclopropyl jarring out of the R1 position.  This seems to make them less easy to put into various solvents. 

1cp was the only one I never ran tests on because it wasnt available as the crystal tartarate at the time.

But I have some suspicion that it may be only lightly soluble in h2o based on Pupnik's trouble leeching the 1cp from the tabs into distilled water.

The tartrate is indeed available upon request, from the Dutch Angels who are entirely responsible for the existence and global availability of every single clearnet Lysergamide.

We are hardcore psychonauts. I respect my 1cP. Very potent to me after decades of psychellic use.


250ug may have drawn a better line for you last night, with enough nail biting awe and intensity, but not so initially overwhelming.


Setting the right tone for a good trip is essential, and this is where exact dosage, timing, and setting and mindframe determine that crucially.


My own trips as I said are always nowadays accompanied with strong kava effects, plus cannabis edibles which really inject some steroids into the trip, in a more LSD mania panic attack and long lasting way lol.


While smoke and vapor peaks quickly but dissipates much faster, so in a way it's easier to steer things back calmly and let go of any thought loops.


With Kava and cannabis, I only need the acid anywhere from 50ug to 200, to haveva strong psychedellic experience.  Potentiation and all that, plus overlap.


But we are all different, but to me 1cP is good, strong acid every time.

For what it's worth, I've been microdosing (or mini-dosing, if you prefer ... about 20ug) 1cP regularly for past few months. Lovely stuff for that purpose IME.

Better than 1p in my experience. Very effective at all doses, low to high, is my own batch 1 unmarked white 1cP.


Just 180ug last night with loads of edible cannabis and kava. Never overwhelming but a good, insightful trip.

I agree that 1cp microdosing is great, I never microdosed LSD itself though, I did with 1p and ALD-52. Hard to distinguish them except that 1p feels even more speedy

Yeah maybe, but even full 1p doses had definitely more of an edge to it for me, very stimulating. That might translate to microdoses, but I only took about 10ug twice or so.

I've tried microdosing with:


- LSD
- ALD-52
- 1p-LSD
- 1cP-LSD
The first thing to note is that I'm perhaps more sensitive to the stimulatory effects that others. For me, 1cP-LSD seems to be the only one that would let me sleep at night without something else to wind me down. This by itself is hugely important. I wouldn't microdose if I had to take a benzo every time I did...


I also seem to be sensitive to the muscle tension (on all psychedelics). Again, my 1cP-LSD microdose experiences were the best of all these.


I do still get gastric effects (I need purge my bowels).


Finally, the mental effects (why I take them) are lovely. I have creative energy, I have insights, I have a surplus of love. I have an overwhelmingly positive view. I am perhaps the opposite of a lot of microdosers in that I microdose on the weekend but not weekdays. Perfect for family time IMO.

[@Listening](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/135453/) thanks for that detailed reply. I find that kind of mini-dose is really perfect for family time too, I can really relate to that - not tried 1cp for that, but with other lysergamides, and other psychedelics at comparable doses.

1cp is less freezy for me — in micro and regular doses.

Since 1cp, my 1p stash just sits there.

I, too, am hypersensitive to stimulatory effects - hate that speedy feeling - and I just don’t get it with 1cp.

I concur with what you say exactly, which mirrors my own feelings and observations, and that speedy, or I call it "abrupt" nature of 1P, is essentially why my 300 + 1P tabs sit stored rightly in the fridge, and a 250 batch of 1cP from a year ago, in 5 50 bags, has simply sat out in my bedroom draw all year. 


About 136 down "now".


I swear I need some sort of Geiger counter to keep track of my trips lol.


Or maybe an abacus!


And yes, even at 10ug microdoses, to me I felt the speedy energy "signature" of the 1P, although it didn't bother me at that dose, and actually when I eventually return to microdosing again, I look forward to using 1P for it's flashy, sparky, stimulative effect.


I feel in general, while 1P really rushes upon you, 1cP is more introspective, less about "It" in your face, but just as immersive. Just a bit more subtle initially with the changing headspace.


I find 1cP to give a glorious floaty, butterfly tummy whole body feeling on the comeup, with a brightening of yellow in my visual field.

I'm new to lysergamides, not other drugs but a 100ug blotter came free with an order of 4-HO-MiPT. 

I was a bit apprehensive to take it so it cut into quarters, even at that i still wasn't sure. But i eventually took about 15ug and didn't feel much. I thought a micro dose would be a good starter to introduce me into it. I didn't feel, think or see anything at first but all that day i felt great, happy and productive.


I'm after taking a small bit over 50ug 20 mins ago so i'll see how a macro dose goes, its Friday and I dont have much to do, and i don't feel this will be too overwhelming. 


I really had a good time researching 4-HO-MiPT, a very tryptamine feeling, very similar to psilocybin I thought. Another 1cP will come with the next order so hopefully today goes well. 

If it does i'm going to see which product i'll microdose with. Such a great after glow with some of these chemical and natural compounds!

Enjoy, it will be fine all the way. But for clarifycation, 50ug is not a macrodose.


It is a "Dose" lol! By accurate definition. I mean, it is too much, IMO to qualify for a "Mini dose." Which is really 20-35 ug for me.


A "Microdose" really can't be higher than 20ug. It is by nature and concept, supposed to be Sub-threshold.


I still consciously feel 10 to 15 ug doses, but I use cannabis edibles and kava everyday, vaporizing weed here and there.


So I can take very small doses of acid and with all of the cross potentiation, have full and powerful trips on 25-35ug.


I actually really love 50ug doses of 1cP in particular. My favorite when life is good, and the most enjoyable all round.


Saturday last I took 300ug 1cP, with loads of strong kava (like 100 grams), lots of cannabis edibles, vaporizer. That is a "macro dose." Anything 100ug above just about qualifies a Macrodose.


Even 75ug is really trying to squeeze it's foot in the door honestly, IMO. Still a strong dose though with 1cP, to me always.


300 ug was a very heavy trip, but never distrurbing, regrettful, unenduable.


But I still can take 50ug doses and have an incredible trip.


All lysergamides go absoltely fantastically with kava by the way.

So guys. I feel I have to report. Two things- I have embarked on a crazy acid bender- 1875 ug Sunday night to Monfay night, 145 grams kava, loadsvedible and vaporized cannabis.


This included 300ug AL LAD as well, which stood out in it's own way and was beautiful.


I also plugged two 1plsd tabs of that 1875 ug, first time I've plugged acid. Wow, it works beautifully. Strong.


I forgot how incredible high dose LSD can be. Electric, luminous. Sparking.


So I took another 50 ug Tuesday night....and had a wonderful, dreamy trip and night, redosed again about 10am today,,Wednesday. Just 100ug.


Vaped lots good weed, walked to a supermarket in a pleasant dream...


Got back, 4.30 I think??, reloaded my vaporizer with Cinderella Jack, and...took an extra 300ug acid- 2 tabs plugged, one oral.


I vaped, next thing I know it's 8.30 pm I think!


Damn, I didn't  plan to drift off, coming up on 300 ug.


But I woke up feeling unusually good because I normally feel like an absolute death when I wake up.


I immediately took another 300ug we which I basically plugged again, for maximum effect.


Came up fast on that surprisingly.


750ug over Wednesdsy, 500ug plugged lol. I drank 40 grams strong kava too tonight.


So a wild acid bender. 2625 ug since Sunday. Had to report here- partly to touch base and also because it's really not so often that we all go so deep.


It's by far the most acid I've taken in such a period of time or at least 8 years myself. 200ug is usually enough to give me enough exhilaration and plenty to think about for at least a week.

I would have really liked to hear and answer on this as well sadly this member appears not to have visited the website this year but hopefully they can come back and shed some light on their subsequent experiences.


Well tripping me lol! Plugging acid feels awsome. No respiratory aggravation which I typically experienced with the higher doses of acid orally.

Wow [@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) that is a helluva cid weekend! 

Must have been amazing and surreal.


You mentioned plugging was beneficial for reducing airway troubles - how is it for reducing nausea?

Hello my good friend Mr DrumTripper and hope things are well with you.


You are dead right too, a hellofa dose, but a "heck" of an experience.


Nothing about it was hellish, from the off.


It's the 3rd most Acid I've ever taken in a relative frame of time. Totally unplanned. 


The plugging felt so different, almost luxurious like ecstasy. And you really know about it as well.


It's difficult obviously to be objective about it as I took loads of Oral tabs too, but I definitely think the plugging negates both the mucus factor, and G.I. bother. 


With a really warm, pleasant, comforting and engrossing whole body buzz.


I'm a bit lost atm to think of much more meaningful. Im headshot obviously, will be for most of the next week.


Just cannabis and kava tonight while I come down to earth over a few days.


Part of me would love to not have to come down, just keep diving into that vibrant, sparky luminence. Im not sure that is possible though, let alone sustainable or wise.


Moderation is necessary.

I’ve always meant to, but have yet to try plugging. 

Going to drop a tab of eth-lad tonight, so might as well make this my first plug experience.

Eth-lad usually gives me some serious temperature swings and nausea, so hopefully this’ll help reduce that.


[@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) I hope you enjoy the smooth return to normalcy and enjoy your cannabis as you slowly glide back to this arena.

Must have been some crazy visuals - i love how they can sometimes persist after trips - i know what you mean by wanting to stay in the sparkly stream.


Have a good weekend! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks man. And asvit goes, I broke suit- I just took another 300ug. I plugged 2 tabs, one oral.


Plugging the tabs isn't so simple for me. Excuse my blaspheness, but fir harm reduction- I have a fairly tight bumhole! Lol.


I find it impossible to plug a half tab.


2 or 3 tabs is even easier. I get them wet first with a drop of water on a spoon- but not too mushy so they turn into mashe during the process,  I have already found out.


I also lubricate the entrance with a little olive oil on my small finger.


But there is still a trick to sliding the piece(s) of paper right up there. They can stick without you knowing. So take some care to ensure you cannskide it up fully, just past the initial entrance passage I think.


I hope you have a nice, enjoyable trip. Im not coming down just yet. One day atva time. Will see what this 300ug feels like today though.

[@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) I was finally resting back on my bed, hot water heatingnforma shower to frehen up, hoping then2 tans 

I plugged reaply did reach the right area- you can't be so sure, like with oral, until you feel it.


But I already had the other 100ug tab orally. So I suddenly figured...fuck it, now I'm this far, take another tab for a legit 200ug oral, and likely properly plugged 200ug.


400ug when I still have barely come down from that wild earlier week, but quantatively in my mind, with half of it plugged, it's more like 500ug to ke 

I swear.


Anyway the only point [@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) I will most likely been tripping with yountonight, albeit far away geographically, and in a fashion I really can't predict atm.


Im thinking, I may have several hours of sleepy, detachedness, before hopefully(and not regrettably either if not lol) after some strange, time dikatednhours, I may be aware suddenly of a real trip going on. 


We will see. I'll be honest though, Im on such a cloud, I won't rule out taking more doses later, providing my mood is good and happy.


Shower first. Infection treatments after,,while I asess my tripping level etc.


[@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) best wishes for your EtH trip later. I would be very interested to hear any feedback. Always a delight to read ypur words and thoughts.


Ignore any typos as usual. Im definitely tripping. You come up fast plugging the acid. But 200uf 1cP orally in my current state would be something by itself 

I swear.

Good thought. I microdosed, but Im allergic to alcohol,,

I used distilled water, and there was never a full dissolution from the tabs into the distilled water.


I don't know if plugging pure alcohol would be be recommended bubble for a start I imagine you would get the psychoactive and toxic effects of the alcoholic self which I generally have to avoid because I'm a heavy daily kava drinker.


Glycerine I cannot tolerate orally due to allergy and excessive mucus reactions but plugging such a thing would negate this issue if it would be effective.


However if you can simply somehow just get the LSD tabs up past the entrance just into the beginning of the colon area like 1.5 in plus and stay there then I imagine that will be as efficiently absorbed as anything and it's certainly felt that way from my recent experiments with it.


It just takes Focus and care care and attention and with practice I'm sure it could be made consistent and straightforward enough but like I say ideally you want to be plugging 3 joint tabs together in order so have something to keep track of and manoeuvre into the right location without too much difficulty of losing track of it.

Holy that’s serious! Adding alladin on top will make for a bubbly trip hopefully.

In a distant dimensio, perhaps we’ll meet later, albeit mine will be a bit later in the day.

But time moves differently than we all think, so part of the trips’ overlap may already have happened.

Thanks, and likewise. It's quite heavy I'll admit. Proper plugging is no joke.


Some Bluedream vapor destroyed me lol. Had a black coffee, 5 drips cbd oil, to perk me up.


Just been clearing lungs of allergy mucus so I can breathe much better and relax, deal with the intensity.


Your own trip [@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) don't enetertain the mere thought of it being any less magical, fullfilling, on a quantative level.


It really doesn't woek strictly like that. Just have a purely positive time I wish.

Dropped 30 minutes ago, 100ug 1cp instead of my intended eth-lad dose.

I felt less frothy (thanks, [@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) for that description - I always associate frothiness with eth) and more like a mellow trip.

And since [@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) is partaking in 1cp, it went under my tongue.


This was smoother last time, but I had a big coffee before so i;m already kinda ramped.

Already getting the feeling and seeing my hd details. Zoning in with 1cp!

Okwell over the peak now and find i didn‘t get the usual low flubbing sounds like i do on 1p.

1cp is a shade warmer on my body and maybe a tad sparklier on the oev.

I neglected to report that during the come up I had a hamburger from Five Guys, and there were two guys in the bun, which was a bit special (first time), otherwise, yeah come up smooth-ish, everything more vibrant and thought became more spacious.

I love it when pleasant things reverberate longer.


between 5 minute sessions on a stationary bicycle, I spent the afternoon and evening in Netflix: "Love and Death and Robots" - and each episode was rich with meaning. (I ff'd through one or two fighting cartoons)

Great to hear you guys having a nice time. Ironically, I almost feel like an outcast suddenly- while you are appreciating the beauty of smaller, still adequate doses, I feel almost ashamed lol!


I did end up utterly wired yesterday. But I drank 70 grams of kava which can wreck me beyond by itself.


650ug total last nightl, 200ug plugged. This morning in bed, I felt how much I am still tripping. That electric body feeling. Mind really not sure where it is.


Like a brand new universe. And totally head wrecked.


3225ug in 5 days is plenty.


But I just took  200ug 1cP orally, after making up 50 grams of silly strong kavas from Vanuatu and Fiji.


I'm just going out there on one I guess. I tripped very hard and deep yesterday, no way was acid not working after the earlier week tripping.


And waking today, feeling electric, ecstatic, I really felt like I have taken so much LSD.


I had a nice big vape of Bluedream just before. Shower time now. On with the kava.


Im hoping just 200 ug is enough today to really boost up what is still vibrantly coursing through my body and consciousness.


So 34 trips atm in 6 days, I thought 35 in a month was quite a lot, October 2019.


But I have taken more than this before, in even a shorter time, and the only after effects I had was cognitive and task performance slowness for a few days, and I felt really really cained. But was really quite happy though.


That was on 5 mg's in 48 hours.


Edit- while showering, I was sure I felt a noticeable rise in lsd euphoria and vibration, leading me to actually also drop the loose neat half tab innthe bag I declined earlier.


250ug SHOULD be my maximum today.


I didn't actually need to trip that hard yesterday. 400ug above is a strong, long lasting experience, and yet supposedly experienced me still naively pretends I can take 650ug, willy nilly, and still just carry on with processions as normal.


I was adoring my low doses for ages, like you guys, and Im sure I will go back to that.


Just majorly "shifting" right now as needs call for it.

Does anyone notice any difference between 1cP-LSD & ALD-52? Just curious as I don't. Though I usually choose my ALD-52 before my 1cP-LSD. Don't know if it's because ALD-52 was the molecule I re-entered lysergamides with after a 25+ years hiatus, or because I've got more of it than of 1cP-LSD...

I definitely noticed a difference.


I took ALD only 2 times ever- 200ug with 33ug 1cP...


And 250ug ALD straight.


Both experiences, from comeup, duration, headspace, nature of OEV's and CEV's....were very unique and distinct to me, after also longtime experience since 1996. 


Honestly, if I could get Jesus to turn all my tabs, 1cP or 1p, into ALD, I wouldn't hesitate.


It's my favorite lysergamide. It's so smooth, last longer, with a kind of second wave for me, and it really gets me to think!


I have only 10.5 tabs of ALD left now. It's unlikely I will get more at any point, so Im just saving them for select experiences. 


Plus the fact they are sealed in the fridge, and Im so compulsive and OCD, I don't think- get that jar out of the fridge to reach room temp so I'm happy to open it....


I just keep scoffing the unrefrigerated 1cP instead.

No shame [@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) in taking a real plunge now and then. I would go that deep if i could, but high doses do things to my body = super sweats, super chills, and yakking. After your week, staying straight for a while will feel like a real trip on its own!


[@PsychedelicSummer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/469523/) I find them very similar, moreso than 1p vs 1cp - but I haven’t back to backed the two.

I feel the same. ALD-52 (or as I like to call it for simplicity, 1A-LSD) is the cleanest, most pure 'acid' experience I've had. I regret eating all my blotters I had already. I have about 10mg in powder, just in storage... I'm too afraid to put it into solution or mess it up somehow. So it just sits lol.


That, and my few grams of various batches of MXE, are my true pride and joy of my stash. Oh and the 31x10mg diazepams that I can't convince myself to waste. Favorite benzo by far.

yes I would have some cream gravy on my burgers!

damn you have MXE, I gotta break into your stash. Never tried it and heard so much goodness.

agree, the ald-52 hits all the heights, and seems to bring not much baggage (load) even less than 1cp, but you can always add some hamburger if you feel a bit thin.

Nathans? they fit the bill, but some exotic sausage fresh from the barbecue with nasty charring on bursting sliced edges packed with olives and mustard would do me fine. 


I am always searching for those bbq carts with a red umbrella and plastic tent, and I miss them a lot lately, but who goes anywhere these days.

[@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) I hope your 40 mics was the usual refreshing experience.


"Nathans" means nothing to me, but it was just a plain, old fashioned fairground style burger/hotdog stall.  Nothing particularly special anyway.


[@DrumTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/502071/) likewise I hope you have enjoyed the afterglow from your own trip.


So maybe you would feel more resistance to telling me I'm not nuts now if I disclose...Sunday, day 7 of my Acid bender, I plugged 600 ug, oral 530ug, all 1cP.


Week total, exactly 5000 ug, 50 tabs.


Was a heavy 1130 ug trip Sunday. Plenty kava, weed, etiz.


Monday I felt a REAL mess, largely due to infection and allergy treatment I have been neglecting while so wasted, I really couldn't breathe, was super exhausted from 6th week now of Flu, plus 50 tabs in 7 days, 1 day off.


I really felt pretty shaken mentally on Monday morning.


I managed to climb out of that ditch, treat allergies and infections supremely well and get firmly back on top of that.


Then 140 ug oral last night, 200 ug plugged 8.25 am today.


Really feel like Im ready to finally come down now, just not so abruptly and harshly from Sunday's 1130 ug.


See...I told you I'm proper nuts!

Had a good one, [@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) and am revitalized. I usually take 25-50 ug, so the full tab blew me away. Plus some amazing Lemon Pie buds - I was able to ”stir the background” with my outstretched hand. Like wave my hand and watch ripples emanate from the path my hand traced. Sat there for what must have been nearly an hour just stirring my walls, floor and ceiling. Did about 3 hours in total dark and silence - very cool cev become oev.


Anyway, hope your week is a smooth glide down! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hello and thanks mate, whenever I see I have a comment from DrumTripper, it's like a trailor for an exciting movie lol!


Except you, like I, are "real", which I love and encourage in people.


To be anything but that is just totally absurd to me anyway.


Wicked, glad you had exactly the level and scope of experience you were ready for at that time.


Indeed I know you appreciate your lower doses, and how a whole legit 100ug of the pretty potent, IMO, 1cP, is enough of a thing.


Plus throw in some real proper modern cannabis, trips turn crazy!


I love those low doses as well. 33ug was one I came to like a lot. Like, that bit extra luminence and longevity than 25 ug, but less drawn out and committing than 50 ug.


Which makes it ironic my past 8 day 53.4 tab bender.


Because I know I can break, then go back to mini doses enjoying them maybe even more we'll see.


Still well off my head obviously. Too much to really appraise it. Only 6 hours ago I plugged the 200 ug, sometimes it's like a queue, it can take longer for subsequent redoses to be picked up by the consciousness.


Have a good week yourself mate and thanks for replying.

That’s what I think, too; once mega doses have been experienced, we can dial back into them somewhat, with mini-doses. Plus weed takes on a new character for a few weeks! Love hearing from ya, take it easy!

So just a final round up.


My wild abandonmement, posessed by "god" knows what (or as legit Satanists Lady Gaga and Dwayne Rock Johnson drop openly into the mix of serious conpversation, respectively..."I said dear Lucifer.." and  "Hail Satan"- "Truth in plain sight" nothing else)....anyway lol...my excursion went on. 6930 ug in 11 days.


Two days off, then 700 ug Sunday, 500 was plugged damn so strong and long lasting I swear. Long, intense peak, def less mucus stuff, and easier to actually eat too.


But 77 tabs in 2 weeks, with 5th and 6th week of grinding true flu, and severe immobilising knee then ankle injury, not an easy, nor advisable course.


Had some real mentally testing moments. Never while tripping. Always good as then, but next days feel mental at times, vaping weed makes me feel as high and twisted as on the actual trips.


Have stopped now, can't take more. Plugged maybe 25 of those tabs, 2,3,4 at a time.


Hope to break a good while, then with discipline try and go back to following your guys really good lead and get back on the sensible microdosing practice of practise of 20 to 50 ug.


Lsd gives... but when you go especially heavy on it it also takes away for a little while afterwards which can be rather unsettling and challenging where as when you stick with the lower doses it gives just the right amount without taking away in such an uncomfortable fashion following.


So that's the plan anyway.

Yeah, true. Many areas of BL,, unfortunately yet understandably have grown somewhat caustic and toxic over the past 9 months due to the divisiveness and make a high tensions and struggle in our Society and individual lives but this particular thread has indeed remained to be a very pleasant place of friendly and civil Communion now that you mention it with no hostility or challenging each other let's try and keep it that way everybody hey!

So I tried a low dose of 90mics of this compound and had a somewhat uncomfortable experience. It made me very withdrawn and uneasy. The was a noticeable body load as well. Also it made me incessantly urinate. I don’t think I react well at low doses as higher ones tend to be much more pleasurable.

From the 60's hippy acid culture, emerged a folklore saying- "An underdose is worse than an overdose!"


Many of us here enjoy "small" or "mini" doses.


I do. Like 20 ug to 35 ug is one range for a certain level of trip.


I particularly have enjoyed 50 ug trips on 1cP many many times.


I ALWAYS potentiate my trips substantially though with cannabis edibles, vapor and kava. So even 25 ug can really elevate me to a brightly lit, sparkly, magical plain.  25 ug with lots of weed and kava, I would personally embark upon instead of just one tab and no weed and/or kava.


An "underdose" is not fixed either. It will be determined by individual requirements, purposes, and moment in time, can vary between people and different points in life.


"The medicine is in the dose" (and so is the "Poison", and they can literally be one and the same, accordingly, as a general principal.)


Im sorry you had an uncomfortable time.


I take mini doses up to 50 ug often.


I have tripped on 75 ug.


It's actually rare I take 100 ug.

Usually if I go that high, I go a good bit higher.


Like 125 ug is a good dose.


150 ug is basically half a full strength OG Microdot, quantatively.


200 above is where the real tripping starts.


If I used no other drugs, I would class 100 ug as an underdose, or maybe just on the margin.


It's a kind of no man's land. I would say that's where you landed at 90 ug.


125 ug may have been much better.


Or just 50 ug. I have had uncomfortable, unrewarding trips on 100 ug, which I felt would have been better at either 50, or 150 ug.


Friday I took 275 ug, loads of weed and kava. I had manic thought loops for hours. Was a really intense trip. 250 ug to 300 is the exact range for the full, complete Lsd experience without a tolerance. Exactly the dosage range of the original trips in 1960's.


Legal Chemist pods in 65/66 were 279 ug. How the Beatles first tripped, including John Lennon.


Jim Morrison, Syd Barrett, Jimi Hendrix etc etc, they all would have begun their Lsd journeys 


But 200 ug can be pretty spectacular and a real ride, especially with cannabis.


I was still off my head all day yesterday. Vaporizing weed pumped me so high on the acid again, as always.


I still feel the trip now.


After John Lennon took his first ever 279 ug trip, he said about it..."I was pretty stoned for about a month."


Meaning, the trip was so mentally impactful for him, it kind of mesemerised him in the integration for a good while after.


I haven't really come down from taking 8 mg"s in 18 days very recently, 475 ug this past week.


It stays "with" you, IMO, except some people just lack the awareness or consciousness to recognize that.


So [@higherconciousness](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/178700/) I would suggest either 50 ug, or 125, 150, 200, 250, depending what sort of level trip you want.


But bypass the 90, 100 ug range. Unless it's an "addition" to cannabis (like...sugar in your tea lol).


I hope you have a more comfortable and enjoyable experience next time.

this is true, 

microdoses - therapeutic frequent -below 25 mics

minidoses - enchanting - between 20 and 60 mics - **my fave**

purgatory - between 60 and 110 mics

full on doses - over 110

fireworks - over 200

Yes I have had HPPD  ery long time already. Like tinnitus. I never nltice the tinmitus, and in fact the reduced sound clarity is a blessing, especially when tripping.


It muffles Mum out lol, and dampens the auditory intensity of the outsode world.


In Novemner I took 1.9 mg's in 18 days. For a while after I had some pretty major HPPD.


But then I sort of forgot about it.


After my recent 8 mg 18 day one, Im not consciously aware of any disturbing HPPD at all, to my surprise.


Only when I vaporize weed maybe, things light up a lot, and at times I get this sort of Leaning Tower of Piza effect, like things are leaning to the left.


I have come out pretty unscathed. My mental acuity, sharpness, memory, verbal socail ability, ease and adeptness couldn't be any sharper or better 


It's the physical side is the struggle. Extreme fatigue condition, severe allergies causing anxiety directly because it's impossible to live any sort of normal life and daily survivial is a feat of pain and endurance.


Take away these abnormal burdens and I would be surprisingly chirpy and seemingly well and normal.

I'm waiting for my 1cp drops to arrive - could be days or weeks (COVID),

so I visited my locked stash to take out tabs for the coming weeks, and one Al-Lad half tab fell on the floor.

I ate the dirty thing and am so happy about it.

Haha, you actually make me feel better my friend because I do feel slightly ashamed at times about my total lack of control.


I took myself a spontaneous and unplanned dose of 1cp tonight of 50ug and it's completely reminded me why I love those doses so much in particular complemented with and complimenting some lovely kava and cannabis edibles and vaporizer the all-round experience is just beautiful incredibly bright yellow luminous and a big thing in itself to be fair but never too much or too taxing just purely enjoyable.


I did like the AL LAD I tried very much. Good spirit on you I say. Wish that you thoroughly enjoy the remainder and wake up tomorrow feeling right and refreshed as I expect.

Yes, that's the other really important point about these particular level dosages the way that you can bring cannabis in at any point because you don't need it initially so much for comfort and restfulness which ironically usually backfires and ramps up Mania and intensity lol, on the heavy macro doses I mean.


But with these 50ug roughly doses which is probably equivalent to 75 ug AL LAD I think, you can bring weed in at any points that feels right and it's really like you're in the moment and it's such a beautiful experience of the cannabis without it pumping the acid up uncomfortably but it makes it very noticeable again but in a much easier and smoother fashion.

My writing on salvia makes little sense in this world, but my lysergic writing is good dialog, tight and clear. 


I have drawn 1000's of instances on acid and in salvia's after glow, usually portraits or street scenes. representational works.


my dream is to paint how the lights look and I have to set up a table near the window to do that. I promise to try that.

Has anyone here taken like a 300ug or 400ug of 1cp? Im planning going big on a trip soon I know everybody has a different experience but I kinda want to get a general understanding of what I'm getting into, I've done 400ug of LSD-25 ("supposedly" street LSD can be iffy on dosage) but I've done high dosages of lsd-25 and was wondering if 1cp would hit harder or be mostly the same?


I've heard there way more professional with laying the lsd on blotter so I just wondering if the feeling would be like more of a truck since street lsd can get wacky "tHis iS tRiPle dIpPed bRo tRuSt mE" ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

Maybe skim back some pages? I took 1875 ug after a 6 week reset, many aeeks back now. 8 mg's by day 18 (minus 70ug to be accurate).


Look at 1cP just like you look at LSD 25, regarding dosage, effects, duration, the sort of doses and frequency taken over time by so many.


It would seem very naive to ask if anybody has ever taken 300 ug of LSD.


That was like the full 60's microdot, 250-300 ug range.


People take 600 ug for a fun walk. 1000ug.


Or 50 ug. It's all over the place.


Lots of accounts to be found, including this thread.

300ug or 400ug is a lot!

LSD blotters are notoriously underdosed, 200ug is enough for a great strong trip, especially if a friend is around that is tripping on a much lower dosage.

I would suggest your brother take maybe 200 ug max first time.


The general rule of thumb, from there is to go up by 50 ug next time once confident.


It depends a lot of you will be using cannabis too. If so, and depending at what stage of the trip, it will play into the intensity of the dosage.


Be cautious about taking 400 ug and smoking/vaping strpng weed on comeup or peak, for example.


5 or 6 hours after such a dose is different and much easier to enjoy the increased effects the weed will add, vs at the 2 to 3.5 hour mark.


200 ug can be an all encompassing life changeing, eye opening experience and give you everything you need for a fantastic spectacle of a trip, with no tolerance.


I am having fully sufficient trips myself currently on 150 ug doses.

Haha, snap! You beat me to it. I just had to go and do loads of steam inhalation stuff for allergies, didn't hit "post reply" before going off.


Indeed 200ug legit, is a lot more than people expect or bargain for at times when most of their life their street tabs were dosed lower than they believed.

If inexperienced, I’d imagine 200ug is a lot. But my first time with 1cP I took two x 100ug And was severely underwhelmed. (Same with many of doses of 200ug ald52...). And it’s from a reputable source, maybe they’re poorly laid maybe I just can’t let go lol


Either way, for a first time, 400ug is not a good place to start, especially for a first time with an lsd analogue

[@AutoTripper](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/517640/) yeah I should've I saw your posts once I started going backward on the thread I'm pretty dumb ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)


[@Buzz](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/64099/) Light beer Yeah street LSD is pretty underdosed I popped about 4 tabs and was hoping I was going to hit around the 400ug mark


[@pupnik](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/311088/) my brother is 23 and has experience with heavy edible use and weed. I'm planning on him going on a lighter dose maybe one tab or half and I was planning on going in deeper


I hope I didn't mix it up what I was saying I'm definitely not trying to give my bro a big dose I was asking those questions for my own curiosity hope I didn't mix it up![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

I'm glad to hear that its sounds like its actually stronger since it's not underdosed I'm probably going to bring it down a notch for my own sake so I don't blow myself too far in space  ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)

I would go no higher yourself, initially, than 300 ug. 100 ug then for your brother.


I love 50 ug myself, but I think the more experienced longterm tripper will find that experience level sufficient and worthwhile.


And exactly on the commonly underdosed street acid.


People would believe they are used to much higher dosesvthannthey actually are. Like the tabs they werentold are 110 ug, maybe are 70 ug in reality.


So even a legit 200 ug can be surprisingly strong and a full whack of a trip.


250ug would be more assuredly comfortable and predictable for yourself too, and should give you everything you seek from it. I understand your wish for it to be full on enough, but 250 ug or above is the full on trip range. 


Hope you and your brother have a good time anyway mate.


Edit- just noticed you mentioned the wrong member above.

You wanted [@Buzz Lightbeer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/509667/) not Buzz.

i would suggest your brother takes 100 ug that will be a safe dose and enough for a first time mind blowing experince and for you to take like 200 ug max. Street acid is very underdosed like 50 ug blotters. You can always take more in the future

So an artist.


Did you notice, I did back then when I was young, that during MDMA's afterglow. If I drew the ink of my Bic pen would seem to be flowing on the paper before hitting it?


A bit like airbrushing I guess. Some of the thing I drew during this fase are remarkable. Typical MDMA style drawing's, the influence of the substance is very obvious to me.

I would totally expect that perception [@emkee_reinvented](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/121874/) , psychedelic time immersion means that you are living is several moments which have not yet faded from consciousness due to extended trails. 

We are enhanced through this stacking of moments of life which normally fade faster supporting the illusion of being in the moment.

In this time frame stack you can easily abide in a point 1/2 second ago (the line is already there) and also watch the freshest edge moment unfold as well (pen to paper) - and thus your pen tip will easily follow the ink it had already put on the paper. I love that effect. (sustained deja vu) I believe it is also related to what happens with the lights: our eyes actually never stay perfectly still so a jagged branched set of rays with layered-enhanced color vibrance - I'll do it, one day, so many projects.

Never looked at it from that angle. 


So what I witnessed was not the ink being drawn from the pen by the paper. But being ahead of time,  totally make's sense. 


N2O has such an effect but multiplied.  'Sustained deja'vu' really good description and explanation.

Have just dumped two tabs under the tongue, will report back later as to effects. Am fully stocked with weed, etizolam, alcohol and some DMT. Lets see where the night goes.


Am expecting this to be very similar to 1p-LSD. Can anyone comment on the pharmacology? Have heard scattered comments that these analogues just metabolise into LSD-25 in the body but unsure if this is supported in literature/educated theory

For some, it seems a touch more potent than 1p, and it is also analog to L25.

Bottom line - you should be in another land by now. ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)

Have a great one!

Definitely more potent. 200ug was definitely very intense and visual (believe 1p I dropped 300ug for similar, perhaps even slightly less intense effects). From dropping to almost baseline was about 9 hours.


very much enjoyed it. Seemed to have a more gentle bodyload than 1p, more similar to straight 25. All in all very impressed

[@guy1234](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/145728/) in the early afternoon I just had a third - ~40 mics? and found it very good.

Later, when the night came on, the city lights were wonderful jewels too.


It is very close to regular lsd

hi, i need to know something; i know this thread is about 1cP-LSD but this is very related ;


are there any chemists that can weigh in here; and maybe call bullshit or verify


i have seen “ALD-52 HCl” at a couple places; but i read that it is unlikely that an HCl salt of a lysergide is real, due to hydrolysis (?) in formation and it not being an easy salt to make (?) 


nonetheless i saw an NMR reading (i think it’s an NMR not a mass spec; i have much to learn)


and i scrubbed out the watermark 


what do you make of this chemists ?

you know, i read some speculation a couple of years ago about the cyclopropyl group. something about what might happen if the bonds suddenly broke and it thwacked the receptor's lights out (i'm paraphrasing). 


i'm sure there's no good reason to be scared of it, but now i feel like i'm turned off from drugs with the cP group. 


anyone remember that one? i suspect it was one of those substituted tryptamine threads, maybe a cyclopropyl on the amine... 


anyway, i'm not trying to spread my brain worms, just shootin the shit.

I'm really starting to appreciate LSD. The trip has a distinct autobiographical component, whereas the PEAs and tryptamines I've tried are more impersonal by comparison. LSD just seems incredibly practical in that the insights relate to my life circumstances. It taps into cognition and alters it in ways that I haven't experienced with tryptamines and PEAs, which are primarily sensory and emotional alterations by comparison. There's just more original content in the LSD trips and they feel less predictable as a result.


At least that's my thoughts after taking 200ug 1cP-LSD today. Actually it was less intense than the 150ug 1P-LSD trip I took last October, although I don't think that's indicative of any trend. It was also much more clear-headed, which I imagine was because I took less phenibut today.

Alright, my new batch of this cutiepie (1cp-lsd) came in, and everything else is on the back burner.


yes it has all the lysergamide feel, as far as tensions and twitches, but they are less of an encumbrance, maybe I hit a hotspot on my tabs, but much gratitude for this.


the research effort continues.

I am courting my inner six year old.

It's old news tbf.


Just read back in this thread, pupnik generally uses small to moderate doses at most to remain functional as an artist and other lively pursuits.


No wrong in that.


But plenty of macro reports here.


I only got batch 1 & 2, no complaints, to me it's everything the cleanest LSD 25 is.


Every tab, 1/4 tab feels every Mic it should, on paper.


2cB diff thing altogether.


I combined 1cP with 2cB-fly one time. Definite enhancement to the 100 micrograms only.


1cP is just....LSD really. Moreso thn 1P IMO.


2cB is another drug set.


Lots of people will take 2cB who are shy of Lysergamides.

just got some 1Vlsd. Really want to try the 2cb but don't have any. Wife and I are looking for a sexy night and 2cb sounds best but since I have the 1v do you think we would get off on 20 mcg ?? Looking for the euphoria not the trip.

Well lol, LSD is not exactly a dose dependant sex, arousal, sensory pleasure enhancng compound.


1VLSD I never took but imagined it would match, and initial reports suggested so.


But it's laid in 150 Micrograms not 100, due to molecular weights.


Like 1PLSD 100 mics holds only about 83 mics.


1cP doesn't seem to have this feature and appears equipotent with 25.


They said from day one, 150 mics of 1V is roughly equivalent to 125 mics of 1cP.


So 20 ug of 1V is actually less than 20 ug of 1cP, but half or one tab is respectively more than the same size portion of a 1cP tab.


2 tabs of 1V therefore delivers around that magical number of 250 mics.


But it's not exactly sex, intimacy, lust or even romance inducing.


I doubt Pupnik would be able to direct you on that one.

I have a certain 100 sheet myself still 1p stored well in fridge since 2019 never seen daylight since arriving, maybe never will.


Countless other batches split foil film & bags K jar dessicant fridge, 20's mainly easy 150 maybe more there.


atm it's unlikely to see a mouth. 


Not even mentioning the greater amount of pristine batch 1 & 2 1cP equally unlikely to surface.


The error I made with all that otherwise smart & timely irt incoming Brexit acquisitioninh was I should just have gotten trillions of ALD tabs instead before the no more Green Giants fully abandoned it's costly production about mid 2020 as 1cP was imminent too.


Because that ALD was a dimension above basically any acid, LSD or anything transcendental even I'd known in 26 years heavy use from all over place too every dose under say, 5.00001 mg's lol.


I was never about being silly with it.


But my own reality, situation, physical condition caters not presently for LSD. 


No enhancement needed at all thanks lol.

Many longterm psychonauts and LSD prodicianados concur.


1p to 25 for me there has always been an unmistakeable subjective distinction, it is prob fair I feel too to say 1p is a little inferior even when lower (or maybe higher?) molecular weight is accounted for.


But 1cP seems on par.


I only took 15 tabs of the ALD but just 400 mics of that would get me to mystical heights even 1 mg of 25 or 1cP could never, in a qualitative aense.

Basically, now I can't offer anything must say re any per se combo potential contraindications i.e. re straight regular LSD 25 and MDMA.


Personally until all my own wild scale exstacy use curtailed in 2005, I always used both MDMA/E/A with LSD, Mushrooms Ketamine Skunk, really best old scool E's and lots of good trips and weed, about my favourite personal combo ever maybe.


Never any personal untoward effects.


So I do not make any distinction here ftr, between original LSD & these clearnet Homologues.


However, they DO each possess their own slight subtly or more notably unique signature, and i this regard alone I WOULD actually suggest to you of those 2, if option...


Choose 1cP over 1PLSD.  Just my advice. Safe travels anyhow.

Not that it needs to be said, but 1cP-LSD is the closest of the lysergamide bunch that was released up to this point, to the real thing.


The real thing is still the real thing tho and hasn’t been outdone, which is certainly interesting.

There is at least a mini qualified concurring collective on precisely this point albeit with additional caveats.


Because in all my experiences and years, the ALD 52 tabs Lizard Labs were pumping out early 2019 persuaded me of a few things.


First, Alexander Shulgin somehow got that one SO wrong I mean how in heck did it's outright superiority to 25 and completeness coupled with both increased smoothness & longevity go over his head that way, I've never understood.


And I don't know how Hofmann regarded it I know he worked with it as well in that legendary WW2 timeframe.


I do know LL decided it was economically too unrewarding and effortful vs producing the others more cost lower yield.


So even if Hofmann did rate ALD, Sandoz's interest is still big big bucks so 25 would be the obvious businessman's choice.


So Shulgin was really v mistaken re ALD 52.


Hoffman I've no idea. 


If I could time travel back though and cost/yield was no matter it was my call too, I'd demand the world knows "ALD 52" Even if "LSD 25" never sees the map.


That said totally still, 1PLSD can never match the best 25.


1cP can be ug per ug and experientially indistinguishable. But ALD was still more completely visually spectacular to my honed senses on this having actually tripped for 25 years as happened before ever certainly knowingly ingesting ALD. 


Also, ETH-LAD has been v popular just vastly subjectively and dosagely distinct to LSD.


And AL-LAD too had quite a fan club. Probably about the easiest lysergamide to take, up to 300-500 mics at least.

1P delivers 83 ug actual effective ug's of petroleum per 100 while 1cP is seemingly indistinguishable there, dosage wise and v much subjectively too.


1P comes up faster for me always, quick rush into full tripping, feels racier bit more hot flushy too and I'd say probably actually more classically visual vs 1cP


But 1cP whoops it on headspace. 1P lasts shortest like shooting a kite up.


Thrilly. 1cP is more the classic.  ALD was still miles over everything for me. 


Nobody can moan though providing their 1cP batch is legit dosed, I was sensible acquiring enough batch 1 pre printed blotters even WoW and batch 2 printed 1cP, but later batches were hugely dissapointing psychonauts who adored the initial batches.

Yeah I can't say much about later batches from anywhere I luckily got in on a half off sale from a reputable research chem supplier.


I can say it is legit dosed.. 300 ug had me overwhelmed and wishing I had a benzo to help me sleep.

Sounds good then! Because a legit 300 mics and many us strongly concurred on it that the 1cP stood out as an equal finally for 25, albeit the godly ALD zipping past radar just briefly


And that the potency was truly up there.


Even 200 mics 1P Jan 2019 after long break whipped my arse, only 166 on paper too!


300 real mics even for me now if I could still take any, I'd buckle myself a little.


250 is where you want there.


200 can be v nice.


Most I took was 2700 mics, and 2500 6 days later but over 1000 and 1000 straight up too many times now honestly to count.


It isn't like oh we never took "proper acid" we're lightweights...


I'm not a f lightweight lol, and 300 ug 1cP give next man, they will never be prepared.


500 mics 1cP at 3:30 am mid summer, REALLY opening lens by 5:30 sunny dawn, one day I had an amazing all day trip.


Vaporized tonnes ganja so so high, drank loads Kava (try that, for trip anxiety mate, never mutes shortens nullifies. More like ketamine on acid, real mellowing adds to effects too while snuffing anxiety


So spent whole sunny day around house in back garden mum, small space too, tripping nuts seeing everything in non 3D angular sense and energy of stuff, while easy being able to see exactly what everyone else could and what I needed to.


So my mum, never suspected an iota I was on like 2 60's OG doses let alone kava and weed wasting me to bits on top, she saw all that ofc and I don't hide tripping at all just not always mention it lol.


But honestly though, in all time, must be such a rare few could maybe pull that off again again, work, houses shops phone chiropractor home!


It remains a phenomena in my mind.

Hello dear psychonauts !


I have a few questions about 1CP-LSD and more specifically the best way to keep it.

I already had the occasion to tried it a few times, and still have 10 blotters in my freezer for like, two years maybe. Actually I don't know the potency still in it, but I plan to take one soon so I will make a report of it asap.

I already let pass a few months between two trips and they were still very good so hopefully they will not have lost a lot of potency !


I plan to stock up some of it, for tripping but also some microdose, and my favorite supplier provide either blotters/liquid vial. In your experience, which one is the best for you ?

As it will be keep for a few months (or even years, it depends on how much I buy), which one is the best and how will you keep it ?


Subsidiary question, did anyone tried it and Al-LAD ? I'm really interesting by the xx-LAD lysergamides (more by Eth-LAD but my supplier don't have it) and will probably buy some in the same time.

I already read TR of it, but I still like first-hand experience to be sure !


By the way, I really love 1CP-LSD ! It's a so wonderful molecule, it really reminds me of the "good" street-LSD I bought back then in rave. Really a good one and 100mcg suffice to got a come-up where I'm not able to communicate in intelligible sentences haha.

It's needed to take note that I'm not very tolerant to psychedelics and I was able to got a ego-death with 2.5g of mushrooms (great experience)


Thanks all for sharing your experiences with Al-LAD and conservation of those nice little lysergamides !

Lucky basterd, when i am on a Lysergic my Mom always assume s i am drunk.

Weird, as i am lucid on it not so much on Booze. But she lost her smell.


So she has to guess explaining my different behaviour always by saying i am on a drug.


1/2 the times she is right, but getting the drug right ![:ROFLMAO:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f923.png)  she really has to do some research.

I offered here ALD-52 when it was available, she declined.

Hi BL,


So as I told you earlier, I'm back to write a statement about conservation of blotters.


So yesterday (sunday 27/07), with my gf, we both eat 1/2 blotters (50µg) to see if they are still potent after almost 3 years, two relocation, and a few issues with the said freezer...and they are still potent as the first day lol. I keep them in the pouch where I did receive it, in a freezer bag and that's it...

We first thought take more than a half because of the potency loss, be we were happy to not had taken more. Good trip (pretty light in visuals, but the trippy music video do the job) which goes for a good 10-11h (come up and come back included).


I could only "recommend" (*I hope this didn't goes any of the rules here*) this product for your experiment ! Really like the real one (as far as I can tell from my meager experience) and a good conservation in time.


So if the Al-Lad act the same, I will keep it the same way and we will see


Cheers
