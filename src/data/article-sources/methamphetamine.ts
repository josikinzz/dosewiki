## Subjective Experience

First synthesised in 1893, methamphetamine was, like amphetamine, used during
World War II to reduce fatigue and increase alertness amongst combatants.
Subsequently, in the 50s and 60s, it was prescribed to treat obesity. Increasing levels
of abuse led, inevitably, to various levels of proscription.

In recent years its recreational use has attracted more than its fair share of horror
stories and media hysteria. Despite this, and the obvious risk of addiction, it remains
extremely popular, particularly as a street drug.

My sample, which was sold as Crystal Meth Ice Shards, weighs in at 92mg. I break it
in half. I then crush one half and split it into 4 small lines of approximately 10mg
each.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I snort the smallest line, which is probably just under 10mg. [3pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:10 Not a lot has happened so far, leading me to believe that I may not
have reached threshold. I'll give it another 5 minutes.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
T+0:15 There is a low stim-like heady feeling in the background, but not much
else. I am also beginning to feel quite warm. Another 10mg is insufflated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:25 This is very mild, so far. Whilst it is billed as more powerful than
amphetamine, I'm finding the opposite. Of course, this could be a weak or
adulterated supply, or I just might need more.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 I snort the remaining 20mg of the initially crushed crystal. I have now
insufflated 40mg in total.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:35 I am starting to sense something stronger. This is headier in nature, I
am more charged, and generally I feel a little dreamy. The body warmth is still
evident, although it is not uncomfortable.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:50 The increased psychoactivity from those last two lines has not
developed any further, and I remain on the same level. Horn? Maybe there is a
little, but it isn’t compelling.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I now crush the other half of my supply, and snort 20mg (10mg with each
nostril). For no apparent reason the left hurts far more than the right.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:00 This is more like it. I am well and truly stimmed, with a bit of a push
into the euphoric field, and horn is definitely now available. I can safely say
that I have moved up a gear or two.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:25 I'm in a decent place with this. I feel pretty good. There is a nice head
buzz, but I still have clarity. It isn't overwhelming or in any way dysfunctional,
and I can interact normally if I wish to.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I snort another 10mg, leaving only 10mg of the original 92mg supply.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:45 I snort the last 10mg. This time I experience something of a rush, but it
is not harsh. It is worth noting that this is very moreish, with the urge to
repeatedly indulge being strong. The policy of only having a fixed amount
available is a wise one, as I instinctively know that I would continue to redose
and binge if more was available.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The feeling of intense and sustained pleasure is almost overwhelming.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 I am still flying nicely, in fact, very nicely indeed. Cloud nine springs
to mind. Ecstasy is another good word.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
Horn can be extraordinarily intense, to the point that it is completely off the
scale. I can certainly see how people engage in mega sex or porn binges with
this, as referred to by this comment on TripSit:
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
“Recreationally, methamphetamine is used to increase sexual drive,
lift the mood, and increase energy, allowing some users to engage in
sexual activity continuously for several days straight”.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
There is a serious danger lurking here though. Given that the heights of such
highly charged and enhanced sex cannot be reached without the chemical, the
potential for long term disappointment under normal (unintoxicated)
circumstances quickly emerges, particularly with repeated use.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I notice that my pupils are dilated. I also haven't eaten since this morning but
my appetite has been completely suppressed.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:40 Time has flown and I sense that I have started a slow decline, or at
least I am settled on to a plateau. However, I am significantly wired, and I am
really enjoying the edge of this, which is a euphoric energised happy buzz.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I am still in the bubble of elation and bliss. I can see why this is so
popular.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I was wrong on the earlier comparison with amphetamine. Although different
this is actually stronger. My erroneous assumption led to quite a heavy dose. I
am somewhat zombified and deep into it, but in a very enjoyable way.
\`\`\`
The effects lasted until bed time, and beyond, such that I barely slept. In the morning
I felt drained but still slightly under the influence, with a background headache. In
other words, I felt rough.

I took the commonly recommended steps to counter this and to speed up recovery,
such as taking some 5-HTP, popping a vitamin tablet, eating good food, drinking
fruit juice and plenty of water, as well as engaging some exercise and smoking a little
cannabis. For more detail on this see the advice offered under the entry for
amphetamine.

My head felt drained. It felt strained, like it wasn’t at all right and was damaged, but
not in a traditional headache sort of way. I also felt de-motivated, and couldn’t be
bothered to do anything. This was all of concern in itself, but at least I knew that I
would recover in time.

Note that the hangover can persist for a lengthy period, and in this case, I was well
under par for the best part of a week. Whilst the experience itself was one of great joy
and pleasure, the payback during the prolonged aftermath was substantial.

One thing I did right was to make sure that I had only the 92mg available: I could not
redose further or take any more. One thing I did wrong was to take 92mg. It was
significantly too much: I should have researched harder and assumed that the supply
was as strong as it was claimed to be, rather than the opposite.

To be addicted to this must be an absolute living nightmare.

NOTE: If you have just used this drug, and you are looking forward to another hit
next weekend, stop. That’s the slippery slope straight in front of you.

A FINAL WORD ON ADDICTION
Given the pharmacological complexity of this chemical, I am not certain that the
following Reddit user’s quote is strictly accurate, but it does broadly capture what
can occur with this drug:

\`\`\`
TheJigmeister: “Also bear in mind that meth floods your brain with
serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. After a while using, your brain burns
itself out and your ability to produce those chemicals without drugs drops to
near zero. So you quit and you're literally physically incapable of feeling
good. It took me over three years to recover to a reasonable level. It does
lasting damage to the pleasure you get out of life”
\`\`\`
On a similar theme, from a different thread:

\`\`\`
Wakewalking: “Your brain does not allow you to reach these peaks again, as
it erodes the receptors that allow it to balance the toxic response it gave
following your first high. This means your brain now can't feel satisfaction
from smaller, normal things in the same way”
\`\`\`
TheFix.Com describes the effect in the following terms:

\`\`\`
“Using crystal meth is, from a biological perspective, like borrowing from a
sadistic loan shark who demands resources faster than you can reasonably
replace them—and the interest rate is unimaginably high. When the drug is
discontinued, the crash is brutal, the high quickly replaced by a state of
bottomless depression and hopelessness.”
\`\`\`
The consequences of this can be appalling. In some cases, they can lead to tragedy, as
illustrated by another Reddit user:

\`\`\`
HrIssue: “My brother was into meth. After three years, when he was at the
edge of losing his job he decided to get clean. 4 weeks after getting clean, he
hung himself. He kept telling us life was just gray and no color”
\`\`\`
My experience from a single experiment was entirely consistent with this. The high
was indescribable; the come-down was horrible. It lasted for days, and even now, in
some ways, I still hanker back to it in that I use it as a reference point and
comparator for all other drugs in this class.

The picture presented by so many users and addicts is broadly the same: the normal
joys of life become less and less special the more you use it. Recovery for heavy users
can take years.

This isn’t propaganda or media hysteria. Please exercise extreme caution with
respect to this drug, particularly regarding regular use.

The aftermath is real, and it can be brutal.

DESCRIPTION #
 
[Methamphetamine Images](https://erowid.org/meth_images.shtml)
 
Methamphetamine is a stimulant chemical commonly used as a recreational drug. It is legally prescribed as a treatment for ADD under the brand name Desoxyn, for both children and adults. On the street, it is generally found as an odorless, white or off-white, bitter-tasting powder, though it is also found in pills, capsules and larger crystals. It is frequently snorted, but is also used orally, smoked, and injected. 
 
 Methamphetamine production is a relatively simple process, especially when compared to many other recreational drugs. It is frequently reported on in the media when home meth-producing labs are busted. 
 
[ [Main Meth Vault](https://erowid.org/meth.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Dose Summary Needed.
 
Price #
 
Methamphetamine is sold for \$100-300 USD retail per gram for good quality crystals and \$50-100 USD for wholesale or friend prices.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/meth_law.shtml) #
 
Methamphetamine is Schedule II in the United States, meaning that it is illegal to buy, sell, or possess without a prescription. It is legally controlled in most countries, although it has medical uses, so it is also available by prescription in many places.
 
[Chemistry](https://erowid.org/meth_chemistry.shtml) #
 
Powder methamphetamine is the hydrochloride salt form which is strongly hygroscopic (absorbs water from the air quickly). The HCl salt is smokable as is. Crystal meth "Crystal Meth" or "Ice" refer to methamphetamine grown into crystals. Though many people believe that Crystal Meth is the freebase form of methamphetamie HCl, this is not true. Methamphetamine is smokable in its normal HCL form, but taking the time to grow it into crystals makes it easier to smoke. Meth in visible crystals (rather than powder) is likely to be relatively pure as it is difficult to grow crystals from impure material. Methamphetamine freebase is an oil and is uncommon on the street.
 
Pharmacology #
 
Pharmacology Summary Needed.
 
Production #
 
The production of Methamphetamine is a fairly simple process which makes it easy to produce in makeshift home laboratories.
 
[History](https://erowid.org/meth_timeline.php) #
 
While Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany, methamphetamine wasn't synthesized until 1919 in Japan.
 
Terminology / Slang #
 
The Substance:
 
Methamphetamine; Meth; Crystal Meth; Speed; Ice; Crank; Tweek or Tweak; Glass; Uppers; Yaba (Pill Form); Shabu Shabu (Pill Form).
 
The Experience:
 
Tweaking.
 
[EFFECTS](https://erowid.org/meth_effects.shtml) #
 
Effects Summary Needed.
 
Onset #
 
Oral use takes about half an hour to produce effects. When smoked, effects are almost instantaneous, and nearly as quick when snorted.
 
Duration #
 
4-8 hours when smoked.
 
Visual Effects #
 
Visuals Summary Needed.
 
PROBLEMS #
 
Methamphetamine use generally increases the heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, and rate of breathing of the user. Chronic use can lead to what is called 'Amphetamine Psychosis', resulting in paranoia, auditory and visual hallucinations, self-absorption, irritability, aggressive and erratic behavior, and picking at the skin. This can be magnified by lack of sleep which often accompanies heavy use of meth. 
 
 Methamphetamine is an anorexant, meaning it causes most people to lose interest in food. This is considered a benefit for many light users, but in regular or heavy users can lead to malnutrition. Methamphetamine is also believed to be neurotoxic.
 
Contraindications #
 
- Do not take Methamphetamine if you are currently taking an MAOI. MAOIs are most commonly found in the prescription anti-depressants Nardil (phenelzine), Parnate (tranylcypromine), Marplan (isocarboxazid), Eldepryl (l-deprenyl), and Aurorex or Manerix (moclobemide). Ayahuasca also contains MAOIs (harmine and harmaline). MAOIs and Methamphetamine are a potentially dangerous combination. Check with your doctor if you are not sure whether your prescription medication is an MAOI.
- Individuals with heart disease (i.e. arteriosclerosis, hypertension) should be extremely careful as Methamphetamine use can cause increased demands on the heart. Intoxication can lead to hypertension that is refractory to treatment and even sudden cardiac arrest.
- Research shows that amphetamines used during pregnancy may decrease the birthweight of the baby as well as increasing the likelihood of cardiac abnormalities (heart problems) and possibly other birth defects.
- Methamphetamine is believed to be transferred through breast milk, so use while breast feeding is a bad idea.
 
Addiction Potential #
 
Methamphetamine causes significant tolerance, as well as psychological dependence. This combination can be particularly bad because the user is likely to have strong cravings for more meth, while at the same time being unable to reach a satisfactory high. Withdrawal from high doses can produce severe depression.

DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 When methamphetamine is first used, the effects can often feel somewhat more like MDMA (Ecstasy) than a simple stimulant including a sense of euphoria, openness, and intellectual expansion. There can be a mild psychedelic component as the new user feels they see the world a little differently. The sensation of 'mind-expansion' and openness quickly fade after the first few uses and physical and mental stimulation dominate the experiential effects. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 As with other psychoactives, different routes of administration have different profiles of effects. Oral methamphetamine ingestion tends to lack rushing, has less euphoric effects, and tends to cause far less of a feeling of wanting to do it again than the other methods. Smoking and injecting methamphetamine are associated with stronger, more euphoric effects and these are more associated with compulsive / addictive user patterns. 
 
 
Addiction and Withdrawal
 Users of large amount of amphetamines over a long period of time can develop an amphetamine psychosis, which is a mental disorder similar to paranoid schizophrenia. The psychosis is manifested by hallucinations, delusions, and paranoia. Bizarre, sometime violent, behavior is exhibited by those with amphetamine psychosis. Symptoms usually disappear within a few weeks after drug use stops. 
 
 
Withdrawal Symptoms
 Amphetamines have the potential to produce tolerance, which means that increased amounts of the drug are needed to achieve the desired effects. Withdrawal symptoms can occur when use of amphetamines is stopped abruptly. Users may experience fatigue; long, disturbed periods of sleep; irritability; intense hunger, and moderate to severe depression. The length and severity of the depression is related to how much and how often amphetamines were used. 
 
 
- craving exhaustion depression mental confusion restlessness and insomnia deep or disturbed sleep lasting up to 48 hours extreme hunger psychotic reaction anxiety reactions
 
Treatment (from [FADAA](http://www.fadaa.org/resource/justfact/amphetamines.html) )
 Medical treatments include the use of antidepressant agents such as imipramine, desipramine, amitriptyline, dosepin, trazodone, or fluoxetine (Prozac). These affect serotonin, the neurotransmitter in the brain that deals with both depression and drug craving. 
 
 Sedatives such as Dalmane, chloral hydrate, Librium, phenobarbital, or even Valium are used, very carefully, on a short-term basis to treat anxiety or sleep disturbance problems. Antipsychotic medications such as Haldol, [Thorazine](https://erowid.org/pharms/chlorpromazine/chlorpromazine.shtml) , and others are also used to buffer the effects of unbalanced dopamine, the neurotransmitter that moderates paranoia and pleasurable sensation. 
 
 In addition to treating the physical and psychological aspects of craving, treatment providers should stress group counseling and peer pressure for compulsive amphetamine users, as these forms of therapy work well for this population. 
 
 
Effects of use During Pregnancy
 It is possible for babies of mothers who use amphetamines to be born with: 
- cardiac defects cleft palate birth defects addiction and withdrawal

DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
Methamphetamine is usually found in the underground markets as powder or crystals. Street meth, like many other street drugs, is often cut or is not meth at all. "Glass" or "Crystal" are terms used to describe street meth that appears as clear crystals instead of powder, reducing the chance that the meth is cut with filler or that it is crushed up amphetamine or methylphenidate (Ritalin) tablets. Street meth dosages vary by how pure the material is, by individual tolerance based on past usage, how frequently it is used, and by differences in individual reaction. Dosages given below are based on pure meth for an infrequent user. 
 
 Pharmaceutical methamphetamine, prescribed rarely for obesity and ADD/ADHD, is sold in the US in 5 mg tablets (10 mg tablets have been discontinued in the United States) that are intended to be taken orally (some are sustained release outside the US). Dosages of 10-25 mg per day are common for prescription pharmaceutical methamphetamine taken orally, usually spread out into two doses. 
 
 A common (although unhealthy) use pattern for methamphetamine is to redose repeatedly for several days in a row. Depending on whether the intention is to stay awake, remain euphoric, or attempt to continue getting 'rushing' effects, doses are repeated every 3-8 hours (to stay awake) or every .5 to 4 hours (to remain "high"). Redosing often involves taking the same dose as the initial dose. As redosing continues beyond 48 hours, the dosages tend to go up. 
 
 Tolerance to meth's effects -- where larger doses are required to achieve similar effects -- increases with frequency of use and with experience. A new user's 15 mg insufflated experience may be very euphoric and stimulating, while a 20 mg bump snorted by a regular user may be barely detectable. Chronic, tolerated users' dosages are generally 2-3 times that of those listed below. These heavy users may go through a gram or more per day. 
 
 The euphoric feeling associated with strong doses of meth fades quickly and after several doses in a row or using meth on multiple days in a row, much higher doses are necessary to achieve a similar level of feeling happy and upbeat. 
 
 MAO inhibitors and CYP450-2D6 inhibitors can increase the effects of methamphetamine and can dangerously inhibit the metabolism of all amphetamines. Some prescription pharmaceuticals are known for producing this effect and new users or users combining herbs, smart drugs, prescriptions, or psychoactive chemicals should be extremely careful of possible interactions. 
 
 Please note that there is substantial evidence that toxicity to the brain's dopamine system occurs with high (or repeated) methamphetamine use.

**N-Methylamphetamine** (also known as **Methamphetamine** , **Ma** , **Meth** , **Glass** , **Ice** , **Shard** , **Crank** , **Tina** , **T** , **Tweak** , **Yaba** , **Shabu** , and **Crystal** ) is a classical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It is structurally related to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , however it crosses the blood-brain barrier more rapidly, due to its relatively high lipid solubility. It produces its effects by increasing levels of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) in the brain.

Methamphetamine was first synthesized from [ephedrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ephedrine) in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagayoshi Nagai. Along with [heroin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heroin) and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) , it has a notorious reputation as a dangerous and highly addictive "street drug".

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement) , [stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement) , [appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) , [increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) . Chronic high-dose use can induce states of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) & [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and violent behavior. It is associated with [compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing) , especially when it is [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) ("smoked") or [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) , due to the overwhelming [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoric) rush it produces in the user upon initial administration.

Methamphetamine has been shown to have extremely high abuse and addiction potential; it is widely considered to be one of the most addictive substances due to the intense euphoria it produces. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Additionally, unlike [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) at therapeutic doses, methamphetamine at moderate to heavy [recreational doses](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) is considered to be directly [neurotoxic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) to humans, damaging both [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) within the central nervous system. In nonhuman mammals, degeneration of monaminergic terminals and neuronal apoptosis (cell death) has been known to occur. In humans the effects are also [neurotoxic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity) . It also displays cardiotoxicity, including [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) and elevated risk of stroke and heart attack.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Amphetamine was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Neither drug had a pharmacological use until 1934, when Smith, Kline, and French began selling amphetamine as an inhaler under the trade name Benzedrine as a decongestant. During World War II, amphetamine and methamphetamine were used extensively by both the Allied and Axis forces for their stimulant and performance-enhancing effects.

Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drugs became known, governments began to place strict controls on the sale of the drugs. For example, in 1970 in the United States, the two drugs methamphetamine and amphetamine became schedule II controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act.

Despite strict government controls, both amphetamine and methamphetamine have still been used legally or illicitly by individuals from a variety of backgrounds for different purposes. Due to the large underground market for these drugs, they are frequently illegally synthesized by clandestine chemists, trafficked, and sold on the black market. Based upon drug and drug precursor seizures, illicit amphetamine production and trafficking is much less prevalent than that of methamphetamine. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) under the trade name "Desoxyn". However, it is rarely prescribed due to its abuse potential, typically being reserved for cases of severe obesity or ADHD in which all other treatment options have been exhausted.

## Chemistry

Methamphetamine, or N-methylamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at R α . Amphetamines are alpha-methylated phenethylamines. Methamphetamine contains an additional methyl substitution at R N , a substitution which is shared with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methcathinone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methcathinone) , and [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) .

### Stereoisomers

Methamphetamine exists as two [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) : dextrorotary and levorotary. Dextrorotatory or dextromethamphetamine (also known as d-methamphetamine) is a stronger central nervous system (CNS) stimulant than levomethamphetamine; however, both are considered to be dependence-forming and addictive when misused and capable of producing similar toxicity symptoms at heavy recreational doses. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

## Pharmacology

Methamphetamine primarily affects the central nervous system (CNS) by acting as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) for [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) , [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) , and [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . It also acts as a [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) for some transporter neurons, thereby holding neurotransmitters like norepinephrine in the synapse. Meth also acts as reverse transporter for some transporter neurons, increasing levels of monoamines by forcing the neurotransmitters out of their storage vesicles and expelling them into the synaptic gap by making the dopamine transporters work in reverse. Other mechanisms by which methamphetamine are known to increase monoamine levels are by:

- Decreasing the expression of dopamine transporters at the cell surface, which has the same effect as listed above.
- Increasing cytosolic levels of monoamines by inhibiting the activity of [monoamine oxidase](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) (MAO)
- Increasing the activity and expression of the [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) -synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)

In addition to releasing potent amounts of monoamines, Methamphetamine has a high lipid solubility which leads to a relatively fast transfer of the drug across the blood-brain barrier and a quick onset in comparison to other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . All of this results in feelings of reward, euphoria, and stimulation as well as an unpleasant offset.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, methamphetamine is usually considered to be extremely energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is identical to that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , but stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) , [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) , and [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . It is similar yet distinct from the stimulation experienced on [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , encouraging physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which methamphetamine presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of motor control. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - As a potent stimulant, methamphetamine is capable producing states of intense physical euphoria, especially when it is [vaporized](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vaporized) or [injected](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Injected) . However, the initial rush of euphoria can wear off well before the substance has run its course which can promote compulsive redosing, which can have extremely damaging cumulative effects.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Body odor alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Body_odor_alteration)** - Methamphetamine can potentially leave a very distinct odor within one's urine, sweat and general bodily secretions. Most people would consider it as unpleasant, but few people do enjoy it and find it a very pleasant odor.
- **[Bronchodilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bronchodilation)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**

- **[Neurotoxicity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotoxicity)** -- from long-term use.
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)** - This effect is more prominent than with any other commonly used [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) .
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)**
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)** - High doses and/or prolonged usage of certain stimulants like methamphetamine and [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) can lead to hallucinatory sensations of bugs crawling on the surface of or underneath one’s skin. This is typically referred to as *delusional parasitosis* or more informally as “meth mites”.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)**

- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses or certain routes of administration, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is an uncommon effect but can happen in those predisposed to them, especially while in physically taxing conditions such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished, or if miusing the substance for extended periods of time. ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of methamphetamine are usually less consistent and are only mildly noticeable at higher dosages. They are somewhat comparable to the visuals produced by [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) and are more frequent in darker areas. Scenarios consisting of severe sleep deprivation caused by [wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) can lead to more intense visual effects and even [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) . 
#### Suppressions
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Visual drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** - This effect is usually subtle or barely noticeable and only occurs at higher dosages or when combined with [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . It is most prominent when smoked or taken intravenously and is usually [delirious](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) in nature. Commonly this, high dosages or prolonged use can cause level 1-2 visual drifting.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)** - This effect occurs very rarely, and typically only when the user has taken high doses, is coming down, or has been awake for unusually long periods. They are usually very mild when they do happen to occur. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of methamphetamine can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The general head space of methamphetamine is described by many as one of extreme mental [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [increased focus](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement) , [ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation) and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or widespread usage. This particularly holds true during the offset of the experience. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Ego inflation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_inflation)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is often very intense when compared to other dopaminergic stimulants such as [Amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or even [Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)
- **[Empathy, affection and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is mild to moderate and usually disappears within the first few uses or after any form of tolerance has developed.
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Thought organization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_organization)**
- **[Time compression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users note sleep paralysis after consuming methamphetamine.
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - This particular after effect is more pronounced than it is with any other commonly used [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

### Neurotoxicity

There is evidence that methamphetamine causes brain damage from long-term use in humans; this damage includes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in gray matter volume in several brain regions and adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.

Unlike [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic to [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) neurons. Moreover, methamphetamine abuse is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson's disease due to excessive pre-synaptic dopamine autoxidation, a mechanism of neurotoxicity. Similar to the neurotoxic effects on the dopamine system, methamphetamine can also result in neurotoxicity to [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [neurons](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurons) . It has been demonstrated that a high core temperature is correlated with an increase in the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine. As a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopamine neurons, chronic use may also lead to post acute withdrawals which persist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and even up to a year.

### Dependence and abuse potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , the chronic use of methamphetamine can be considered extremely addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to the effects of methamphetamine rapidly develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Methamphetamine presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of methamphetamine all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

The evidence on effective treatments for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine dependence and abuse is limited. In light of this, [fluoxetine](/w/index.php?title=Fluoxetine&action=edit&redlink=1) and [imipramine](/w/index.php?title=Imipramine&action=edit&redlink=1) appear to have some limited benefits in treating abuse and addiction, "no treatment has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and abuse".

In highly dependent [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) and methamphetamine abusers, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue methamphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams. Withdrawal symptoms are associated with the degree of dependence (i.e., the extent of abuse). The mental depression associated with methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) withdrawal.

Although it is clear that vaporised methamphetamine is more addictive than oral or insufflated amphetamine, there is debate as to whether the drug itself is inherently more addictive, and if so, how important the difference is. Besides the duration of action, the main difference between the two drugs is that methamphetamine is proportionally more centrally and less peripherally active. One reason is because the increased lipid solubility of the methyl group causes faster central absorption. Another cause is the fact that methamphetamine releases proportionally more dopamine at an equivalent dose. D-methamphetamine releases a dopamine:norepinephrine ratio of ~1:1.3 from synapses versus ~1:2 for d-amphetamine. Their effect on the norepinephrine (NET) and dopamine (DAT) transporters are more alike but there is a slight difference. D-methamphetamine favours NET by a factor of about 4 vs 5 for d-amphetamine. D-methamphetamine is also slightly more serotonergic. This may be a negligible difference, as the ratio of serotonin:norepinephrine release is only 1:60 for d-methamphetamine and 1:80 for d-amphetamine. Neither drug has any appreciable affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT).

This increased central vs peripheral effect of methamphetamine agrees with the common subjective feeling among stimulant users that the methamphetamine high has less of an inherently 'jittery' quality to it. The downside is that this aversive effect may be helpful as it discourages harmful levels of use. It is unclear what real world impact this difference has. A double-blind but small study of 13 methamphetamine users revealed only a minor preference towards methamphetamine, and this may be explained by the users having a greater familiarity with the drug.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Psychosis

Abuse of methamphetamine can result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and methamphetamine abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Psychosis very rarely arises from therapeutic use.

### Overdose

A methamphetamine overdose may result in a wide range of symptoms and is potentially fatal at heavy dosages. A moderate overdose of methamphetamine may induce symptoms such as abnormal heart rhythm, confusion, dysuria, high or low blood pressure, hyperthermia, hyperreflexia, myalgia, severe agitation, tachypnea, tremor, urinary hesitancy, and urinary retention. An extremely large overdose may produce symptoms such as adrenergic storm, methamphetamine psychosis, anuria, cardiogenic shock, cerebral hemorrhage, circulatory collapse, hyperpyrexia, pulmonary hypertension, renal failure, rhabdomyolysis, [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , and a form of stereotypy ("tweaking"). A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage due to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity. Death from fatal methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.

#### Emergency treatment

Acute methamphetamine overdose is largely managed by treating the symptoms, and administration of [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) relieves symptoms such as agitation, hypertension, tachycardia, and seizure.

### Harm reduction

Studies have shown that [N-acetylcysteine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/N-acetylcysteine) (NAC) can block the harmful neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine while preventing neurotransmitter depletion in rats and clinical trials in humans to treat methamphetamine dependence are currently underway. NAC may be effective for reducing the cravings and psychological dependence as well. NAC has a short half life and a sustained release formulation may be preferred for harm reduction purposes. Selenium has also been shown to protect the brain against meth induced neurotoxicity. However, it is worth noting that this data is preliminary and may not be applicable to humans.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **Alcohol** - Drinking alcohol on stimulants is considered risky because it reduces the sedative effects of the alcohol that the body uses to gauge drunkenness. This often leads to excessive drinking with greatly reduced inhibitions, increasing the risk of liver damage and increased dehydration. The effects of stimulants will also allow one to drink past a point where they might normally pass out, increasing the risk. If you do decide to do this then you should set a limit of how much you will drink each hour and stick to it, bearing in mind that you will feel the alcohol and the stimulant less.
- **GHB** / **GBL** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of sedatives. If the stimulant wears off first then the depressant effects of the GHB/GBL may overcome the user and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Opioids** - Stimulants increase respiration rate allowing a higher dose of opiates. If the stimulant wears off first then the opiate may overcome the patient and cause respiratory arrest.
- **Cocaine** - The rewarding effects of cocaine are mediated by DAT inhibition, and an increase of exocytosis of dopamine through the cell membrane. Amphetamine reverses the direction of DAT and the direction vesicular transports within the cell by a pH mediated mechanism of displacement, thus excludes the regular mechanism of dopamine release through means of exocytosis because the effects Na+/K+ ATPase are inhibited. You will find cardiac effects with the combination of cocaine and amphetamine due to a SERT mediated mechanism from the subsequent activation of 5-HT2B, which is an effect of serotonin-related valvulopathy. Amphetamines generally cause hypertension in models of abuse, and this combination can increase the chances of syncope due to turbulent blood flow during valve operation. The rewarding mechanisms of cocaine are reversed by administration of amphetamine.
- **Cannabis** - Stimulants increase [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) levels and the risk of [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) which can lead to negative experiences.
- **Caffeine** - This combination of stimulants is generally considered unnecessary and may increase strain on the heart, as well as potentially causing anxiety and physical discomfort.
- **Tramadol** - Tramadol and stimulants both increase the risk of seizures.
- **DXM** - Both substances raise heart rate, in extreme cases, panic attacks caused by these substances have led to more serious heart issues.
- **Ketamine** - Combining amphetamine and ketamine may result in psychoses that resemble schizophrenia, but not worse than the psychoses produced by either substance alone, but this is debatable. This is due to amphetamines ability to attenuated the disruption of working memory caused by ketamine. Amphetamine alone may result in grandiosity, paranoia, or somatic delusions with little to no effect on negative symptoms. Ketamine, however, will result in thought disorders, disruption of executive functioning, and delusions due to a modification of conception. These mechanisms are due to an increase of dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway caused by amphetamine due to its pharmacology effecting dopamine, and due to a disruption of dopaminergic functioning in the mesocortical pathways via NMDA antagonism effects of ketamine. Combining the two, you may expect mainly thought disorder along with positive symptoms.
- **PCP** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Methoxetamine** - Increases risk of tachycardia, hypertension, and manic states.
- **Psychedelics** (e.g. ***[LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [psilocybin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocybin)*** ) - Increases risk of [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) . 
- **25x-NBOMe** - Amphetamines and NBOMes both provide considerable stimulation that when combined they can result in tachycardia, hypertension, vasoconstriction and, in extreme cases, heart failure. The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants are also not good in combination with psychedelics as they can lead to unpleasant thought loops. NBOMes are known to cause seizures and stimulants can increase this risk.
- **2C-T-x** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **5-MeO-xxT** - Suspected of mild MAOI properties. May increase the risk of hypertensive crisis.
- **DOx**
- **aMT** - aMT has MAOI properties which may interact unfavorably with amphetamines.
- **MAOIs** - MAO-B inhibitors can increase the potency and duration of phenethylamines unpredictably. MAO-A inhibitors with amphetamine can lead to hypertensive crises.

## Effects
The body's own performance drug noradrenaline is released, the simultaneous release of dopamine increases self-esteem. Since methamphetamine reaches the brain more quickly than amphetamine and the stimulating effect is stronger, it causes a stronger high and has a higher addiction potential than amphetamine. The body temperature rises, pulse and breathing are accelerated, blood pressure is increased. Hunger and the need for sleep are suppressed. The willingness to take risks is increased, the sensation of pain is suppressed, and euphoria, extreme nervousness, and an increased urge to talk ("babble flash") can occur. Methamphetamine has a pleasure-increasing and disinhibiting effect, which is why it is also used as a sex drug.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Methamphetamine can sometimes hardly be distinguished from amphetamine, but has a much stronger effect. Short-term side effects are: tense jaw muscles, dry mouth, temperature increase, great loss of fluid, increased heart rate as well as increased blood pressure and trembling all over the body. Irritability and aggressive behaviour can also occur (especially in combination with alcohol).

### Long-term Risks
Methamphetamine is a highly depleting substance with a very high dependence potential with psychological and physical symptoms. Aggression, depression, mental coldness and the desire for more characterise the period of regular use. Constant restlessness, sleep and circulatory disorders, paranoia and even amphetamine psychosis can occur. Weight loss, skin inflammations ("speed pimples"), tooth loss, stomach problems and cramps are also possible. In menstruating persons, the menstrual cycle may be disturbed. Snorting damages the nasal mucous membranes and nasal septum, swallowing damages the stomach mucous membranes. Chronic consumption favours brain haemorrhages and strokes with sudden paralysis. It is suspected that the use of methamphetamine (especially mixed use with MDMA) can lead to irreversible changes or damage in the brain!

## Safer Use
- Dose low, methamphetamine is a highly potent substance!
- Take vitamin C and D and minerals (iron, calcium and magnesium) with frequent use.
- Eat enough after consumption to prevent weight loss.
- Drink a lot (soft drinks).
- Follow the safer-sniffing and safer-sex rules.
- Refrain from mixed consumption. Make sure to take breaks from consumption.
- Mentally ill persons, persons with high blood pressure, liver and kidney diseases, diabetics and pregnant women should not use methamphetamine.
- It is better not to wear headgear (danger of overheating!).
- Have your substance analysed in a drug check.

  "thedrugclassroom": `# Dimethocaine
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/dimethocaine/*

Dimethocaine is a local anesthetic and a stimulant that has some cocaine-like activity. It’s generally reported to be weaker than cocaine and amphetamine.

A minimal amount of recreational use has been reported since the late 2000s.

The substance was previously used in the 1930s as an anesthetic.

---

Dimethocaine = Larocaine; 94-15-5

PubChem: 7177

Molecular formula: C16H26N2O2

Molecular weight: 278.396 g/mol

IUPAC: [3-(diethylamino)-2,2-dimethylpropyl] 4-aminobenzoate

---

## Dose

#### Intranasal (tentative)

- Range: 50 – 200 mg

---

## Timeline

#### Intranasal (tentative)

- Total: 2 – 4 hours
- Onset: 00:10 – 00:20

#### IV (tentative)

- Total: 10 – 30 minutes
- Onset: Within seconds

---

## Experience Reports

[Erowid](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Dimethocaine.shtml)

---

---

## Effects

#### Positive

- Euphoria
- Stimulation
- Increased talkativeness
- Mood lift

#### Negative

- Tachycardia
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Vasoconstriction
- Insomnia
- Paranoia
- Anxiety

There are a limited number of reports about the drug’s effects. Most point to little activity or, at most, mild euphoria and mild stimulation.

Stimulation and euphoria offered by the drug is generally said to be weaker than what’s offered by cocaine or amphetamine.

The local anesthetic effect generally leads to numbness in the nasal region when taken intranasally.

Some users have experienced fatigue and slight mental impairment when the effects dissipate and even a lasting CNS depressant effect into the following day. However, the lack of experience reports makes it difficult to tell how common these after effects are.

**Animal studies**

It had a memory impairing effect in mice in a maze test. This was hypothesized in the paper to come from a dopamine mechanism. Lidocaine, which lacks similar dopaminergic activity, didn’t have the same response.

Greater locomotor activity and cocaine-like behavior effects were observed in mice.

Anxiogenic effects were seen at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg in a maze test in mice.

Dimethocaine had some apparent dose-dependent antinociceptive effects in mice, including in writhing and hot-plate tests.

---

## Chemistry & Pharmacology

#### Chemistry

Dimethocaine has a structure that’s closer to procaine, a drug that lacks psychoactive effects, than cocaine. A major difference is that it lacks a tropane ring.

#### Pharmacology

It functions as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Possible actions at other sites haven’t been examined.

The drug was only slightly less potent than cocaine for displacing mazindol at the dopamine transporter (DAT).

DA reuptake inhibition potency appears to go in this order: Cocaine > Dimethocaine > Tetracaine > Procaine > Chloroprocaine.

Dimethocaine elevated dopamine in the nucleus accumbens in rats. It’s also been shown to elevate dopamine levels in the striatum.

EC500 (concentration for 500% basal level) in striatum

- Cocaine: 15 uM
- Dimethocaine: 57 uM
- Procaine: 3.5 mM

Discriminative stimulus

It’s been found to be 2-3x less potent than cocaine in some drug discrimination studies.

Dimethocaine fully substituted for cocaine when rats were trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. It also fully substituted when rats were trained to discriminate cocaine from procaine, further indicating cocaine-like effects.

#### Pharmacokinetics

Investigation of its pharmacokinetics in rats showed extensive metabolism. The most important phase 1 steps were hydroxylation and deethylation. The most important phase 2 steps were acetylation and glucuronidation.

In vitro tests found roles for CYP1A2, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. N-acetylation was carried out by NAT2, but not NAT1.

## History

#### 1930s

It was originally created by Hoffmann-La Roche Company and appeared on the market under the name “larocaine.”

Early pharmacological information came from Fromherz in 1930. Dimethocaine was tested on rabbit cornea and on the spinal cord of dogs. It was more potent than cocaine and procaine.

Dimethocaine was used as an anesthetic, primarily in dentistry, ophthalmology, and otolaryngology.

It gained “considerable populariry” in the US and other countries between the early and late-1930s.

There are reports of it being used in many procedures. Schildbach (1931) performed over 350 operations of various kinds with it. Volkmann (1931) found a 1% solution was effective and a 10% solution subcutaneously was equal to a 20% solution of cocaine.

Balcarek (1931) reported it was their anesthetic of choice for ophthalmology.

An overview of its effects was published in 1935 by Leo Mayer from Northwestern University’s Medical School (Department of Ophthalmology). He had received the drug from Hoffmann-La Roche for a trial in 1932.

#### 1930s – 1940s

Its use was eventually abandoned by the 1940s, reportedly due to its psychoactive effects.

#### 2000s to 2010s

Dimethocaine appeared on the EMCDDA’s list of “synthetic cocaine derivatives.”

Some of the earliest online reports were in 2008. Within a couple years it appeared in head shops and online stores around Europe.

Products in Ireland included Mind Melt, Amplify, Amplifier, Mint, and Mania. An analysis of substances confirmed dimethocaine’s presence in Amplify and Amplifier. It was sometimes detected alongside an impurity, desethyldimethocaine.

Those who reported injecting either of those products reported a 3-6 minute “crazy rush” that could even surpass cocaine. That effect was reportedly followed by a few hours of feeling “stoned.” Some people claimed it was stronger than any other stimulant they had used and provided a smooth, consistent experience.

Some users reported taking up to 5 to 10 grams per day of Amplify and Amplifier. Negative effects associated with the drugs included agitation, seizures, and psychosis. The comedown was associated with hallucinations, agitation, depression, suicidal thoughts, loss of awareness, loss of motor control, and paranoia.

A 2010 survey of 329 “legal high” users in Ireland found 3% reported using dimethocaine.

Another analysis of products from an online seller in the UK found that one of the dimethocaine products actually contained caffeine and lidocaine.

There have been multiple cases of other drugs being sold as dimethocaine, including tetracaine, lidocaine, ethylphenidate, caffeine, dimethylcathinone, and methiopropamine. Those reports appeared between 2010 and 2016.

## Safety

We don’t have enough information to know how safe the drug is, especially with long-term use. It’s wise to use the lowest possible dose as infrequently as possible and without combinations.

#### Lethal dose

LD50 values

Mouse (subcutaneous): 300 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 24 mg/kg)

Rabbit (subcutaneous): 150 mg/kg (potential human equivalent of 49 mg/kg)

---

Cardiotoxicity is a concern with the substance and it’s possible the drug poses similar (or greater) risks to cocaine.

---

#### Risky Combinations (list may not be complete)

Other stimulants, MAOIs, and tramadol.

**Methamphetamine** is a strong physical and mental stimulant. It is legally prescribed as a treatment for ADD under the brand name Desoxyn, for both children and adults. Recreationally, methamphetamine is used to increase sexual drive, lift the mood, and increase energy, allowing some users to engage in sexual activity continuously for several days straight. Methamphetamine production is a relatively simple process, especially when compared to many other recreational drugs which has contributed to its widespread use. It is frequently reported on in the media when home meth-producing labs are busted.

Methamphetamine exists as two [enantiomers](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Glossary#Enantiomer), dextrorotary and levorotary. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger central nervous system(CNS) stimulant than levomethamphetamine; however, both are addictive and produce the same toxicity symptoms at high doses. Methamphetamine may be sold illegally, either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in an equal parts mixture of the right and left handed molecules (i.e., 50% levomethamphetamine and 50% dextromethamphetamine). Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are schedule II controlled substances in the United States. Similarly, the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many other countries due to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substancestreaty. In contrast, levomethamphetamine is an over-the-counter drug in the United States.

## History

Amphetamine, discovered before methamphetamine, was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanesechemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Three decades later, in 1919, methamphetamine hydrochloride was synthesized by pharmacologist Akira Ogata via reduction of ephedrine using red phosphorus and iodine. During World War II, methamphetamine was used extensively by the Axis forces for its stimulant effects. Obetrol, patented by Obetrol Pharmaceuticals in the 1950s and indicated for treatment of obesity, was one of the first brands of pharmaceutical methamphetamine products. Due to the psychological and stimulant effects of methamphetamine, Obetrol became a popular diet pill in America in the 1950s and 1960s. Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to strictly regulate the production and distribution of methamphetamine. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, methamphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Currently, methamphetamine is sold under the trade name Desoxyn, trademarked by the Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck. As of January 2013, the Desoxyn trademark had been sold to Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati.

## Harm Reduction

When dealing with methamphetamine it's important to remember that a large number of the harms come not from the drug itself, but from the behaviors the drug causes individuals to exhibit. Loss of sleep, poor nutrition, and poor self care are the cause of many of the negative effects. 

- Methamphetamine lasts for a long time and will impair sleep. Dose early in the day and do not redose to avoid sleep disruption.

- Oral ROA has less redose compulsion than other routes such as vaporization.

- It is important to eat and stay hydrated, even if you do not feel the need for food. Even if you are not feeling like eating you can generally have some fruit or a bowl of cereal or yogurt with granola.

- It is important to keep up on your self-care. "Meth mouth" is caused by poor oral hygiene combined with the habit of users to sip sugary beverages to relieve dry mouth symptoms. Use water and not soda to relieve dry mouth. Remember to brush your teeth after eating or consuming any caloric beverages.

- Stimulant drugs can cause kidney damage and stroke in users with high blood pressure. If you have been diagnosed or told you have high blood pressure use with caution.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Systematic name: N-methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-amine

At room temperature, the free base of methamphetamine is a clear and colorless liquid with an odor characteristic of geranium leaves. It is soluble in diethyl ether and ethanol as well as miscible with chloroform. In contrast, the methampetamine hydrochloride salt is odorless with a bitter taste. It has a melting point between 170 to 175 °C (338 to 347 °F) and, at room temperature, occurs as white crystals or a white crystalline powder. The hydrochloride salt is also freely soluble in alcohol and water.

Powder methamphetamine is the hydrochloride salt form which is strongly hygroscopic (absorbs water from the air quickly). The HCl salt is smokable as is. Crystal meth "Crystal Meth" or "Ice" refer to methamphetamine grown into crystals. Though many people believe that Crystal Meth is the freebase form of methamphetamie HCl, this is not true. Methamphetamine is smokable in its normal HCL form, but taking the time to grow it into crystals makes it easier to smoke. Meth in visible crystals (rather than powder) is likely to be relatively pure as it is difficult to grow crystals from impure material. Methamphetamine freebase is an oil and is uncommon on the street.

*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine*

Methamphetamine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant that is primarily used as a recreational or performance-enhancing drug and less commonly as a second-line treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It has also been researched as a potential treatment for traumatic brain injury. Methamphetamine was discovered in 1893 and exists as two enantiomers: levo-methamphetamine and dextro-methamphetamine. Methamphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical substance, the racemic free base, which is an equal mixture of levomethamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine in their pure amine forms, but the hydrochloride salt, commonly called crystal meth, is widely used. Methamphetamine is rarely prescribed over concerns involving its potential for misuse as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant, among other concerns, as well as the availability of other drugs with comparable effects and treatment efficacy such as dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine. While pharmaceutical formulations of methamphetamine in the United States are labeled as methamphetamine hydrochloride, they contain dextromethamphetamine as the active ingredient. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger CNS stimulant than levomethamphetamine.
Both racemic methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are illicitly trafficked and sold owing to their potential for recreational use and ease of manufacture. The highest prevalence of illegal methamphetamine use occurs in parts of Asia and Oceania, and in the United States, where racemic methamphetamine and dextromethamphetamine are classified as Schedule II controlled substances. Levomethamphetamine is available as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for use as an inhaled nasal decongestant in the United States and is seldom abused. Internationally, the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or banned in many countries, owing to its placement in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. While dextromethamphetamine is a more potent drug, racemic methamphetamine is illicitly produced more often, owing to the relative ease of synthesis and regulatory limits of chemical precursor availability.
The effects of methamphetamine are nearly identical to other substituted amphetamine. In low to moderate and therapeutic doses (5–25 mg orally), methamphetamine produces typical SNDRA effects and may elevate mood, increase alertness, concentration, and energy, reduce appetite, and promote weight loss. In overdose or during extended binges, it may induce psychosis, breakdown of skeletal muscle, seizures, and bleeding in the brain. Chronic high-dose use can precipitate unpredictable and rapid mood swings, stimulant psychosis (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, delirium, and delusions), and aggression. Recreationally, methamphetamine's ability to increase energy has been reported to lift mood and increase sexual desire to such an extent that users are able to engage in sexual activity continuously for several days while binging the drug. Methamphetamine is known to possess a high abuse liability (a high likelihood that extratherapeutic use will lead to compulsive drug use) and high psychological dependence liability (a high likelihood that withdrawal symptoms will occur when methamphetamine use ceases). Discontinuing methamphetamine after heavy use may lead to a post-acute-withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for months beyond the typical withdrawal period. At high doses, like other substituted amphetamine, methamphetamine is neurotoxic to human midbrain dopaminergic neurons and, to a lesser extent, serotonergic neurons. Methamphetamine neurotoxicity causes adverse changes in brain structure and function, such as reductions in grey matter volume in several brain regions, as well as adverse changes in markers of metabolic integrity.

Methamphetamine belongs to the substituted phenethylamine and substituted amphetamine chemical classes and as a drug acts as a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent. It is related to the other dimethylphenethylamines as a positional isomer of these compounds, which share the common chemical formula C10H15N.

## Uses

### Medical

In the United States, methamphetamine hydrochloride, sold under the brand name Desoxyn, is FDA-approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, the FDA notes that the limited therapeutic usefulness of methamphetamine should be weighed against the risks associated with its use. To avoid toxicity and risk of side effects, FDA guidelines recommend an initial dose of methamphetamine at doses 5–10 mg/day for ADHD in adults and children over six years of age, and may be increased at weekly intervals of 5 mg, up to 25 mg/day, until optimum clinical response is found; the usual effective dose is around 20–25 mg/day. Methamphetamine is sometimes prescribed off-label for obesity, narcolepsy, and idiopathic hypersomnia. In the United States, methamphetamine's levorotary form is available in some over-the-counter (OTC) nasal decongestant products.
Although the pharmaceutical name "methamphetamine hydrochloride" may suggest a racemic mixture, Desoxyn contains enantiopure dextromethamphetamine, which is a more potent stimulant than both levomethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine. This naming convention deviates from the standard practice observed with other stimulants, such as Adderall and dextroamphetamine, where the dextrorotary enantiomer is explicitly identified as an active ingredient in both generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals.
As methamphetamine is associated with a high potential for misuse, the drug is regulated under the Controlled Substances Act and is listed under Schedule II in the United States. Methamphetamine hydrochloride dispensed in the United States is required to include a boxed warning regarding its potential for recreational misuse and addiction liability.
Desoxyn Gradumet was an extended-release form of the drug. It is no longer produced.

### Recreational

Methamphetamine is often used recreationally for its effects as a potent euphoriant and stimulant as well as aphrodisiac qualities.
According to a National Geographic TV documentary on methamphetamine, an entire subculture known as party and play is based around sexual activity and methamphetamine use. Participants in this subculture, which consists almost entirely of homosexual male methamphetamine users, will typically meet up through internet dating sites and have sex. Because of its strong stimulant and aphrodisiac effects and inhibitory effect on ejaculation, with repeated use, these sexual encounters will sometimes occur continuously for several days on end. The crash following the use of methamphetamine in this manner is very often severe, with marked hypersomnia (excessive daytime sleepiness). The party and play subculture is prevalent in major US cities such as San Francisco and New York City.

## Contraindications

Methamphetamine is contraindicated in individuals with a history of substance use disorder, heart disease, or severe agitation or anxiety, or in individuals currently experiencing arteriosclerosis, glaucoma, hyperthyroidism, or severe hypertension. The FDA states that individuals who have experienced hypersensitivity reactions to other stimulants in the past or are currently taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors should not take methamphetamine. The FDA also advises individuals with bipolar disorder, depression, elevated blood pressure, liver or kidney problems, mania, psychosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, seizures, thyroid problems, tics, or Tourette syndrome to monitor their symptoms while taking methamphetamine. Owing to the potential for stunted growth, the FDA advises monitoring the height and weight of growing children and adolescents during treatment.

## Adverse effects

### Physical

#### Cardiovascular

Methamphetamine is a sympathomimetic drug that causes vasoconstriction  and tachycardia.  Methamphetamine also promotes abnormal extra heartbeats and irregular heart rhythms, which may be life-threatening.

#### Other physical effects

The effects can also include loss of appetite, hyperactivity, dilated pupils, flushed skin, excessive sweating, increased movement, dry mouth and teeth grinding (potentially leading to condition informally known as meth mouth), headache, rapid breathing, high body temperature, diarrhea, constipation, blurred vision, dizziness, twitching, numbness, tremors, dry skin, acne, and pale appearance. Long-term meth users may have sores on their skin; these may be caused by scratching due to itchiness or the belief that insects are crawling under their skin, and the damage is compounded by poor diet and hygiene. Numerous deaths related to methamphetamine overdoses have been reported. Additionally, "[p]ostmortem examinations of human tissues have linked use of the drug to diseases associated with aging, such as coronary atherosclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis", which may be caused "by a considerable rise in the formation of ceramides, pro-inflammatory molecules that can foster cell aging and death."

#### Dental and oral health ("meth mouth")

Methamphetamine users, particularly heavy users, may lose their teeth abnormally quickly, regardless of the route of administration, from a condition informally known as meth mouth. The condition is generally most severe in users who inject the drug, rather than swallow, smoke, or inhale it. According to the American Dental Association, meth mouth "is probably caused by a combination of drug-induced psychological and physiological changes resulting in xerostomia (dry mouth), extended periods of poor oral hygiene, frequent consumption of high-calorie, carbonated beverages and bruxism (teeth grinding and clenching)". As dry mouth is also a common side effect of other stimulants, which are not known to contribute severe tooth decay, many researchers suggest that methamphetamine-associated tooth decay is more due to users' other choices. They suggest the side effect has been exaggerated and stylized to create a stereotype of current users as a deterrence for new ones.

#### Sexually transmitted infection

Methamphetamine use was found to be related to higher frequencies of unprotected sexual intercourse in both HIV-positive and unknown casual partners, an association more pronounced in HIV-positive participants. These findings suggest that methamphetamine use and engagement in unprotected anal intercourse are co-occurring risk behaviors, behaviors that potentially heighten the risk of HIV transmission among gay and bisexual men. Methamphetamine use allows users of both sexes to engage in prolonged sexual activity, which may cause genital sores and abrasions as well as priapism in men. Methamphetamine may also cause sores and abrasions in the mouth via bruxism, increasing the risk of sexually transmitted infection.
Besides the sexual transmission of HIV, it may also be transmitted between users who share a common needle. The level of needle sharing among methamphetamine users is similar to that among other drug injection users.

### Psychological

The psychological effects of methamphetamine can include euphoria, dysphoria, changes in libido, alertness, apprehension and concentration, decreased sense of fatigue, insomnia or wakefulness, self-confidence, sociability, irritability, restlessness, grandiosity and repetitive and obsessive behaviors. Peculiar to methamphetamine and related stimulants is "punding", persistent non-goal-directed repetitive activity. Methamphetamine use also has a high association with anxiety, depression, amphetamine psychosis, suicide, and violent behaviors.

### Neurotoxicity

Methamphetamine is directly neurotoxic to dopaminergic neurons in both lab animals and humans. Excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, metabolic compromise, UPS dysfunction, protein nitration, endoplasmic reticulum stress, p53 expression and other processes contributed to this neurotoxicity. In line with its dopaminergic neurotoxicity, methamphetamine use is associated with a higher risk of Parkinson's disease. In addition to its dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a review of evidence in humans indicated that high-dose methamphetamine use can also be neurotoxic to serotonergic neurons. It has been demonstrated that a high core temperature is correlated with an increase in the neurotoxic effects of methamphetamine. Withdrawal of methamphetamine in dependent persons may lead to post-acute withdrawal which persists months beyond the typical withdrawal period.
Magnetic resonance imaging studies on human methamphetamine users have also found evidence of neurodegeneration, or adverse neuroplastic changes in brain structure and function. In particular, methamphetamine appears to cause hyperintensity and hypertrophy of white matter, marked shrinkage of hippocampi, and reduced gray matter in the cingulate cortex, limbic cortex, and paralimbic cortex in recreational methamphetamine users. Moreover, evidence suggests that adverse changes in the level of biomarkers of metabolic integrity and synthesis occur in recreational users, such as a reduction in N-acetylaspartate and creatine levels and elevated levels of choline and myoinositol.
Methamphetamine has been shown to activate TAAR1 in human astrocytes and generate cAMP as a result. Activation of astrocyte-localized TAAR1 appears to function as a mechanism by which methamphetamine attenuates membrane-bound EAAT2 (SLC1A2) levels and function in these cells.
Methamphetamine binds to and activates both sigma receptor subtypes, σ1 and σ2, with micromolar affinity. Sigma receptor activation may promote methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity by facilitating hyperthermia, increasing dopamine synthesis and release, influencing microglial activation, and modulating apoptotic signaling cascades and the formation of reactive oxygen species.

### Addiction

Current models of addiction from chronic drug use involve alterations in gene expression in certain parts of the brain, particularly the nucleus accumbens. The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are ΔFosB, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB). ΔFosB plays a crucial role in the development of drug addictions, since its overexpression in D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for most of the behavioral and neural adaptations that arise from addiction. Once ΔFosB is sufficiently overexpressed, it induces an addictive state that becomes increasingly more severe with further increases in ΔFosB expression. It has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others.
ΔJunD, a transcription factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase enzyme, both directly oppose the induction of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens (i.e., they oppose increases in its expression). Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block many of the neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug use (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB). ΔFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce expression of ΔFosB (i.e., they cause the brain to produce more of it), chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction. ΔFosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sex addictions, which are compulsive sexual behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use. These sex addictions (i.e., drug-induced compulsive sexual behaviors) are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs, such as amphetamine or methamphetamine.

#### Epigenetic factors

Methamphetamine addiction is persistent for many individuals, with 61% of individuals treated for addiction relapsing within one year. About half of those with methamphetamine addiction continue with use over a ten-year period, while the other half reduce use starting at about one to four years after initial use.
The frequent persistence of addiction suggests that long-lasting changes in gene expression may occur in particular regions of the brain, and may contribute importantly to the addiction phenotype. In 2014, a crucial role was found for epigenetic mechanisms in driving lasting changes in gene expression in the brain.
A review in 2015 summarized a number of studies involving chronic methamphetamine use in rodents. Epigenetic alterations were observed in the brain reward pathways, including areas like ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens, and dorsal striatum, the hippocampus, and the prefrontal cortex. Chronic methamphetamine use caused gene-specific histone acetylations, deacetylations and methylations. Gene-specific DNA methylations in particular regions of the brain were also observed. The various epigenetic alterations caused downregulations or upregulations of specific genes important in addiction. For instance, chronic methamphetamine use caused methylation of the lysine in position 4 of histone 3 located at the promoters of the c-fos and the C-C chemokine receptor 2 (ccr2) genes, activating those genes in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). c-fos is well known to be important in addiction. The ccr2 gene is also important in addiction, since mutational inactivation of this gene impairs addiction.
In methamphetamine addicted rats, epigenetic regulation through reduced acetylation of histones, in brain striatal neurons, caused reduced transcription of glutamate receptors. Glutamate receptors play an important role in regulating the reinforcing effects of addictive drugs.
Administration of methamphetamine to rodents causes DNA damage in their brain, particularly in the nucleus accumbens region. During repair of such DNA damages, persistent chromatin alterations may occur such as in the methylation of DNA or the acetylation or methylation of histones at the sites of repair. These alterations can be epigenetic scars in the chromatin that contribute to the persistent epigenetic changes found in methamphetamine addiction.

#### Treatment and management

A 2018 systematic review and network meta-analysis of 50 trials involving 12 different psychosocial interventions for amphetamine, methamphetamine, or cocaine addiction found that combination therapy with both contingency management and community reinforcement approach had the highest efficacy (i.e., abstinence rate) and acceptability (i.e., lowest dropout rate). Other treatment modalities examined in the analysis included monotherapy with contingency management or community reinforcement approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, 12-step programs, non-contingent reward-based therapies, psychodynamic therapy, and other combination therapies involving these.
As of December 2019, there is no effective pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine addiction. A systematic review and meta-analysis from 2019 assessed the efficacy of 17 different pharmacotherapies used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for amphetamine and methamphetamine addiction; it found only low-strength evidence that methylphenidate might reduce amphetamine or methamphetamine self-administration. There was low- to moderate-strength evidence of no benefit for most of the other medications used in RCTs, which included antidepressants (bupropion, mirtazapine, sertraline), antipsychotics (aripiprazole), anticonvulsants (topiramate, baclofen, gabapentin), naltrexone, varenicline, citicoline, ondansetron, prometa, riluzole, atomoxetine, dextroamphetamine, and modafinil.
Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) combines FDA-approved medications with behavioral therapies to address substance use disorders. This approach aims to reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms, supporting individuals in their recovery process.

#### Dependence and withdrawal

Tolerance is expected to develop with regular methamphetamine use and, when used recreationally, this tolerance develops rapidly. In dependent users, withdrawal symptoms are positively correlated with the level of drug tolerance. Depression from methamphetamine withdrawal lasts longer and is more severe than that of cocaine withdrawal.
According to the current Cochrane review on drug dependence and withdrawal in recreational users of methamphetamine, "when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue [methamphetamine] use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24 hours of their last dose". Withdrawal symptoms in chronic, high-dose users are frequent, occurring in up to 87.6% of cases, and persist for three to four weeks with a marked "crash" phase occurring during the first week. Methamphetamine withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, drug craving, dysphoric mood, fatigue, increased appetite, increased movement or decreased movement, lack of motivation, sleeplessness or sleepiness, and vivid or lucid dreams.
Methamphetamine that is present in a mother's bloodstream can pass through the placenta to a fetus and be secreted into breast milk. Infants born to methamphetamine-abusing mothers may experience a neonatal withdrawal syndrome, with symptoms involving of abnormal sleep patterns, poor feeding, tremors, and hypertonia. This withdrawal syndrome is relatively mild and only requires medical intervention in approximately 4% of cases.

### Neonatal

Unlike other drugs, babies with prenatal exposure to methamphetamine do not show immediate signs of withdrawal. Instead, cognitive and behavioral problems start emerging when the children reach school age.
A prospective cohort study of 330 children showed that at the age of 3, children with methamphetamine exposure showed increased emotional reactivity, as well as more signs of anxiety and depression; and at the age of 5, children showed higher rates of externalizing disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

## Overdose

Methamphetamine overdose is a diverse term. It frequently refers to the exaggeration of the unusual effects with features such as irritability, agitation, hallucinations and paranoia. The cardiovascular effects are typically not noticed in young healthy people. Hypertension and tachycardia are not apparent unless measured. A moderate overdose of methamphetamine may induce symptoms such as: abnormal heart rhythm, confusion, difficult or painful urination, high or low blood pressure, high body temperature, over-active or over-responsive reflexes, muscle aches, severe agitation, rapid breathing, tremor, urinary hesitancy, and an inability to pass urine. An extremely large overdose may produce symptoms such as adrenergic storm, methamphetamine psychosis, substantially reduced or no urine output, cardiogenic shock, bleeding in the brain, circulatory collapse, hyperpyrexia (i.e., dangerously high body temperature), pulmonary hypertension, kidney failure, rapid muscle breakdown, serotonin syndrome, and a form of stereotypy ("tweaking"). A methamphetamine overdose will likely also result in mild brain damage owing to dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotoxicity. Death from methamphetamine poisoning is typically preceded by convulsions and coma.

### Psychosis

Use of methamphetamine can result in a stimulant psychosis which may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., paranoia, hallucinations, delirium, and delusions). A Cochrane Collaboration review on treatment for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine use-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, antipsychotic medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis. Amphetamine psychosis may also develop occasionally as a treatment-emergent side effect.

### Death from overdose

The CDC reported that the number of deaths in the United States involving psychostimulants with abuse potential to be 23,837 in 2020 and 32,537 in 2021. This category code (ICD–10 of T43.6) includes primarily methamphetamine but also other stimulants such as amphetamine, and methylphenidate. The mechanism of death in these cases is not reported in these statistics and is difficult to know. Unlike fentanyl which causes respiratory depression, methamphetamine is not a respiratory depressant. Some deaths are as a result of intracranial hemorrhage and some deaths are cardiovascular in nature including flash pulmonary edema and ventricular fibrillation.

### Emergency treatment

Acute methamphetamine intoxication is largely managed by treating the symptoms and treatments may initially include administration of activated charcoal and sedation. There is not enough evidence on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis in cases of methamphetamine intoxication to determine their usefulness. Forced acid diuresis (e.g., with vitamin C) will increase methamphetamine excretion but is not recommended as it may increase the risk of aggravating acidosis, or cause seizures or rhabdomyolysis. Hypertension presents a risk for intracranial hemorrhage (i.e., bleeding in the brain) and, if severe, is typically treated with intravenous phentolamine or nitroprusside. Blood pressure often drops gradually following sufficient sedation with a benzodiazepine and providing a calming environment.
Antipsychotics such as haloperidol are useful in treating agitation and psychosis from methamphetamine overdose. Beta blockers with lipophilic properties and CNS penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating CNS and cardiovascular toxicity. The mixed alpha- and beta-blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine. The phenomenon of "unopposed alpha stimulation" has not been reported with the use of beta-blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity.

## Interactions

Methamphetamine is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP2D6, so CYP2D6 inhibitors will prolong the elimination half-life of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine also interacts with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), since both MAOIs and methamphetamine increase plasma catecholamines; therefore, concurrent use of both is dangerous. Methamphetamine may decrease the effects of sedatives and depressants and increase the effects of antidepressants and other stimulants as well. Methamphetamine may counteract the effects of antihypertensives and antipsychotics owing to its effects on the cardiovascular system and cognition respectively. The pH of gastrointestinal content and urine affects the absorption and excretion of methamphetamine. Specifically, acidic substances will reduce the absorption of methamphetamine and increase urinary excretion, while alkaline substances do the opposite. Owing to the effect pH has on absorption, proton pump inhibitors, which reduce gastric acid, are known to interact with methamphetamine. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like atomoxetine prevent norepinephrine release induced by amphetamines and have been found to reduce the stimulant, euphoriant, and sympathomimetic effects of dextroamphetamine in humans. Similarly, norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) like methylphenidate and bupropion prevent norepinephrine and dopamine release induced by amphetamines and bupropion has been found to reduce the subjective and sympathomimetic effects of methamphetamine in humans.

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

Methamphetamine has been identified as a potent full agonist of trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates brain catecholamine systems. Activation of TAAR1 increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and either completely inhibits or reverses the transport direction of the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and serotonin transporter (SERT). When methamphetamine binds to TAAR1, it triggers transporter phosphorylation via protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, ultimately resulting in the internalization or reverse function of monoamine transporters. Methamphetamine is also known to increase intracellular calcium, an effect which is associated with DAT phosphorylation through a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CAMK)-dependent signaling pathway, in turn producing dopamine efflux. TAAR1 has been shown to reduce the firing rate of neurons through direct activation of G protein-coupled inwardly-rectifying potassium channels. TAAR1 activation by methamphetamine in astrocytes appears to negatively modulate the membrane expression and function of EAAT2, a type of glutamate transporter.
In addition to its effect on the plasma membrane monoamine transporters, methamphetamine inhibits synaptic vesicle function by inhibiting VMAT2, which prevents monoamine uptake into the vesicles and promotes their release. This results in the outflow of monoamines from synaptic vesicles into the cytosol (intracellular fluid) of the presynaptic neuron, and their subsequent release into the synaptic cleft by the phosphorylated transporters. Other transporters that methamphetamine is known to inhibit are SLC22A3 and SLC22A5. SLC22A3 is an extraneuronal monoamine transporter that is present in astrocytes, and SLC22A5 is a high-affinity carnitine transporter.
Methamphetamine is also an agonist of the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors and sigma receptors with a greater affinity for σ1 than σ2, and inhibits monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). Sigma receptor activation by methamphetamine may facilitate its central nervous system stimulant effects and promote neurotoxicity within the brain. Dextromethamphetamine is a stronger psychostimulant, but levomethamphetamine has stronger peripheral effects, a longer half-life, and longer perceived effects among heavy substance users. At high doses, both enantiomers of methamphetamine can induce similar stereotypy and methamphetamine psychosis, but levomethamphetamine has shorter psychodynamic effects.

### Pharmacokinetics

The bioavailability of methamphetamine is 67% orally, 79% intranasally, 67 to 90% via inhalation (smoking), and 100% intravenously. Following oral administration, methamphetamine is well-absorbed into the bloodstream, with peak plasma methamphetamine concentrations achieved in approximately 3.13–6.3 hours post ingestion. Methamphetamine is also well absorbed following inhalation and following intranasal administration. Because of the high lipophilicity of methamphetamine due to its methyl group, it can readily move through the blood–brain barrier faster than other stimulants, where it is more resistant to degradation by monoamine oxidase. The amphetamine metabolite peaks at 10–24 hours. Methamphetamine is excreted by the kidneys, with the rate of excretion into the urine heavily influenced by urinary pH. When taken orally, 30–54% of the dose is excreted in urine as methamphetamine and 10–23% as amphetamine. Following IV doses, about 45% is excreted as methamphetamine and 7% as amphetamine. The elimination half-life of methamphetamine varies with a range of 5–30 hours, but it is on average 9 to 12 hours in most studies. The elimination half-life of methamphetamine does not vary by route of administration, but is subject to substantial interindividual variability.
CYP2D6, dopamine β-hydroxylase, flavin-containing monooxygenase 3, butyrate-CoA ligase, and glycine N-acyltransferase are the enzymes known to metabolize methamphetamine or its metabolites in humans. The primary metabolites are amphetamine and 4-hydroxymethamphetamine; other minor metabolites include: 4-hydroxyamphetamine, 4-hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxyphenylacetone, benzoic acid, hippuric acid, norephedrine, and phenylacetone, the metabolites of amphetamine. Among these metabolites, the active sympathomimetics are amphetamine, 4‑hydroxyamphetamine, 4‑hydroxynorephedrine, 4-hydroxymethamphetamine, and norephedrine. Methamphetamine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor.
The main metabolic pathways involve aromatic para-hydroxylation, aliphatic alpha- and beta-hydroxylation, N-oxidation, N-dealkylation, and deamination. The known metabolic pathways include:

#### Detection in biological fluids

Methamphetamine and amphetamine are often measured in urine or blood as part of a drug test for sports, employment, poisoning diagnostics, and forensics. Chiral techniques may be employed to help distinguish the source of the drug to determine whether it was obtained illicitly or legally via prescription or prodrug. Chiral separation is needed to assess the possible contribution of levomethamphetamine, which is an active ingredients in some OTC nasal decongestants, toward a positive test result. Dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of methamphetamine and other drugs in urine.

## Chemistry

Methamphetamine is a chiral compound with two enantiomers, dextromethamphetamine and levomethamphetamine. At room temperature, the free base of methamphetamine is a clear and colorless liquid with an odor characteristic of geranium leaves. It is soluble in diethyl ether and ethanol as well as miscible with chloroform.
In contrast, the methamphetamine hydrochloride salt is odorless with a bitter taste. It has a melting point between 170 and 175 °C (338 and 347 °F) and, at room temperature, occurs as white crystals or a white crystalline powder. The hydrochloride salt is also freely soluble in ethanol and water. The crystal structure of either enantiomer is monoclinic with P21 space group; at 90 K (−183.2 °C; −297.7 °F), it has lattice parameters a = 7.10 Å, b = 7.29 Å, c = 10.81 Å, and β = 97.29°.

### Degradation

A 2011 study into the destruction of methamphetamine using bleach showed that effectiveness is correlated with exposure time and concentration. A year-long study (also from 2011) showed that methamphetamine in soils is a persistent pollutant. In a 2013 study of bioreactors in wastewater, methamphetamine was found to be largely degraded within 30 days under exposure to light.

### Synthesis

Racemic methamphetamine may be prepared starting from phenylacetone by either the Leuckart or reductive amination methods. In the Leuckart reaction, one equivalent of phenylacetone is reacted with two equivalents of N-methylformamide to produce the formyl amide of methamphetamine plus carbon dioxide and methylamine as side products. In this reaction, an iminium cation is formed as an intermediate which is reduced by the second equivalent of N-methylformamide. The intermediate formyl amide is then hydrolyzed under acidic aqueous conditions to yield methamphetamine as the final product. Alternatively, phenylacetone can be reacted with methylamine under reducing conditions to yield methamphetamine.

## History, society, and culture

Amphetamine, discovered before methamphetamine, was first synthesized in 1887 in Germany by Romanian chemist Lazăr Edeleanu who named it phenylisopropylamine. Shortly after, methamphetamine was synthesized from ephedrine in 1893 by Japanese chemist Nagai Nagayoshi. Three decades later, in 1919, methamphetamine hydrochloride was synthesized by pharmacologist Akira Ogata via reduction of ephedrine using red phosphorus and iodine.
From 1938, methamphetamine was marketed on a large scale in Germany as a nonprescription drug under the brand name Pervitin, produced by the Berlin-based Temmler pharmaceutical company. It was used by all branches of the combined armed forces of the Third Reich, for its stimulant effects and to induce extended wakefulness. Pervitin became colloquially known among the German troops as "Stuka-Tablets" (Stuka-Tabletten) and "Herman-Göring-Pills" (Hermann-Göring-Pillen), as a snide allusion to Göring's widely-known addiction to drugs. However, the side effects, particularly the withdrawal symptoms, were so serious that the army sharply cut back its usage in 1940. By 1941, usage was restricted to a doctor's prescription, and the military tightly controlled its distribution. Soldiers would only receive a couple of tablets at a time, and were discouraged from using them in combat. Historian Łukasz Kamieński says,

A soldier going to battle on Pervitin usually found himself unable to perform effectively for the next day or two. Suffering from a drug hangover and looking more like a zombie than a great warrior, he had to recover from the side effects.
Some soldiers turned violent, committing war crimes against civilians; others attacked their own officers. At the end of the war, it was used as part of a new drug: D-IX.
Obetrol, patented by Obetrol Pharmaceuticals in the 1950s and indicated for treatment of obesity, was one of the first brands of pharmaceutical methamphetamine products. Because of the psychological and stimulant effects of methamphetamine, Obetrol became a popular diet pill in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Eventually, as the addictive properties of the drug became known, governments began to strictly regulate the production and distribution of methamphetamine. For example, during the early 1970s in the United States, methamphetamine became a schedule II controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act. As of January 2013, the Desoxyn trademark had been sold to Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati.

## Trafficking

The Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia), specifically Shan State, Myanmar, is the world's leading producer of methamphetamine as production has shifted to ya ba and crystalline methamphetamine, including for export to the United States and across East and Southeast Asia and the Pacific.
Concerning the accelerating synthetic drug production in the region, the Cantonese Chinese syndicate Sam Gor, also known as The Company, is understood to be the main international crime syndicate responsible for this shift. It is made up of members of five different triads. Sam Gor is primarily involved in drug trafficking, earning at least \$8 billion per year. Sam Gor is alleged to control 40% of the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine market, while also trafficking heroin and ketamine. The organization is active in a variety of countries, including Myanmar, Thailand, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, China, and Taiwan. Sam Gor previously produced meth in Southern China and is now believed to manufacture mainly in the Golden Triangle, specifically Shan State, Myanmar, responsible for much of the massive surge of crystal meth in circa 2019. The group is understood to be headed by Tse Chi Lop, a gangster born in Guangzhou, China who also holds a Canadian passport.
Liu Zhaohua was another individual involved in the production and trafficking of methamphetamine until his arrest in 2005. It was estimated over 18 tonnes of methamphetamine were produced under his watch.

## Legal status

The production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions. In some jurisdictions, it is legally available as a prescription medication. Methamphetamine has been placed in schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty, indicating that it has limited medical use.

## Research

Animal models have shown that low-dose methamphetamine improves cognitive and behavioural functioning following TBI (traumatic brain injury). This is in contrast to high, repeated doses which cause neurotoxicity. These models demonstrate that low-dose methamphetamine increases neurogenesis and reduces apoptosis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus following TBI. It has also been found that TBI patients testing positive for methamphetamine at the time of emergency department admission have lower rates of mortality.
It has been suggested, based on animal research, that calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D, can provide significant protection against the DA- and 5-HT-depleting effects of neurotoxic doses of methamphetamine. Protection against methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity has also been observed following administration of ascorbic acid (vitamin C), cobalamin (vitamin B12), and vitamin E.
