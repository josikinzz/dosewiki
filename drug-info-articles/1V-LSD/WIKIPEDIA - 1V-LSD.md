*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1V-LSD*

1V-LSD, also known as 1-valeryl-LSD or by the nickname Valerie, is a psychedelic drug of the lysergamide family related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). It is an analogue of LSD and is thought to act as a prodrug of LSD.
1V-LSD has been sold online until an amendment to the German NpSG was enforced in 2022 which controls 1P-LSD and now 1cP-LSD, 1V-LSD and several other lysergamides.

## Use and effects

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

As demonstrated with other N-acylated derivatives of LSD, 1V-LSD is believed to serve as a prodrug for LSD but may also act directly as a weak partial agonist at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor.
A head-twitch response assay in mice found that 1V-LSD has a similar potency to 1P-LSD and 1cP-LSD, with behavioral effects also closely resembling these structural analogs.

## Chemistry

### Synthesis

1V-LSD is the condensation product of valeric acid (pentanoic acid) and LSD, where the valeroyl group is substituted on the NH position of the indole moiety.

### Detection

Ehrlich's reagent is used to identify the presence of an indole moiety; the chemical backbone of the lysergamide and ergoline molecules. However, as with other N-acylated lysergamides, 1V-LSD reacts very slowly to Ehrlich reagent and may not give reliable results if the reagent isn't fresh.

### Analogues

Related compounds include 1B-LSD, 1cP-LSD, 1D-LSD, 1P-LSD, and AL-LAD, among others.

## Society and culture

### Legal status

#### Germany

An amendment to the NpSG banned the sale of 1V-LSD in Germany in September 2022. Due to a interpunctation error in the actualised NpSG, the ban never took effect. The law was amended in March 2023, now banning 1V-LSD.

#### North America

1V-LSD is not a controlled substance in North America (United States and Canada), unless sold for human consumption in the US.

#### South Korea

1V-LSD was placed under legal control in South Korea in July 2022 on a temporary but renewable basis.

#### Sweden

Since March 2nd 2022, 1V-LSD has been under investigation in Sweden and may therefore soon become controlled.
