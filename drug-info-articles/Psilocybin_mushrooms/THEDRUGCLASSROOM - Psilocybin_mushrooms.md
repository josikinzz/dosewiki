*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/psilocin-psilocybin/*

Psilocin is a naturally occurring psychedelic that has been used for hundreds of years. It is found alongside psilocybin in a number of fungal species, particularly of the Psilocybe genus. Psilocybin is a prodrug for psilocin.

It has a very low physical harm potential, though psychological concerns do exist. Acute issues like psychosis and panic attacks have been recorded. Lasting psychological problems are rare.
