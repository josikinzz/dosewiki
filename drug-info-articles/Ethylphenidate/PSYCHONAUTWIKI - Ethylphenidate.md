**Ethylphenidate** (also known as **EPH** ) is a novel [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) substance of the [phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Phenidate) class that produces traditional [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Route_of_administration) .

It is a closely related analog of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) (brand names Ritalin, Concerta). The two substances have very similar pharmacological mechanisms but discernible differences in their subjective effects with ethylphenidate often considered to be recreational.

Ethylphenidate is most commonly distributed as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) by online vendors, due to its grey-area legal status in certain countries.

## Chemistry

Ethylphenidate is a synthetic molecule of the [substituted phenethylamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenethylamine) and [substituted phenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_phenidate) classes. It contains a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino -NH2 group through an ethyl chain. It is structurally similar to [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) , featuring a substitution at R α which is incorporated into a [piperidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Piperidine) ring ending at the terminal amine of the phenethylamine chain. Additionally, it contains an ethyl acetate bound to R β or its structure. Ethylphenidate is structurally differed to [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) by elongation of the carbon chain. *Ethyl-* regards the side chain of two carbon atoms, *phen-* indicates the phenyl ring, *id-* is contracted from a piperidine ring, and *-ate* indicates the acetate group containing the oxygens. Ethylphenidate is a chiral compound, presumably produced as a racemic mixture.

## Pharmacology

Ethylphenidate acts as both a [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) , meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) in the brain by binding to and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. This allows dopamine and norepinephrine to accumulate within the brain, resulting in stimulating and euphoric effects.

All available data on ethylphenidate's pharmacokinetics are drawn from studies conducted on rodents. It has been found that ethylphenidate is more selective to the dopamine transporter (DAT) than [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) , having approximately the same efficacy as the parent compound, but with significantly less activity on the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Its dopaminergic pharmacodynamic profile is nearly identical to methylphenidate and is primarily responsible for its euphoric and reinforcing effects.

The following is ethylphenidate's binding profile in the mouse, alongside methylphenidate's. Figures for both the racemic and the dextrorotary [enantiomers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Enantiomers) are given:

Ethylphenidate can be formed within the body (in the liver), when [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) and [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) are co-ingested. This is most common when large quantities of [methylphenidate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylphenidate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) are consumed at the same time, such as in non-medical use or overdose scenarios. A similar process is also known to occur when [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) are consumed together, forming [cocaethylene](/w/index.php?title=Cocaethylene&action=edit&redlink=1) . However, only a few percent of the consumed methylphenidate is converted to ethylphenidate, so a pharmacologically significant dose with measurable physiological effects would never be produced.

## Subjective effects

The general headspace of ethylphenidate is described by many as one of extreme mental stimulation, increased focus, and powerful euphoria. It contains a large number of typical [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. Although negative side effects are usually mild at low to moderate dosages, they become increasingly likely to manifest themselves with higher amounts or extended usage. This particularly holds true during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of the experience.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - Ethylphenidate is usually reported to be energetic and stimulating in a fashion that is distinct but much weaker than that of [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) or [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) and stronger than that of [modafinil](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Modafinil) and [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) . At lower to moderate doses, it encourages general productivity and at higher dosages it encourages physical activities such as dancing, socializing, running, or cleaning. The particular style of stimulation which ethylphenidate presents can be described as forced. This means that at higher dosages, it becomes difficult or impossible to keep still as jaw clenching, involuntarily bodily shakes and vibrations become present, resulting in extreme shaking of the entire body, unsteadiness of the hands, and a general lack of fine motor control.
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Norepinephrine reuptake inhibition causes the sympathetic nervous system to constrict vessels and puts strain on the cardiovascular system with prolonged use.
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate dosages as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The euphoric rush associated with ethylphenidate use, as result of [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibition) , is very short-lived and compulsive, similarly to that of [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) .
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - This can be described as the experience of time speeding up and passing much quicker than it usually would when sober.
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)** ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational ethylphenidate use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because ethylphenidate has a very limited history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from people who have tried ethylphenidate within the community suggests that there do not seem to be any negative health effects attributed to simply trying this substance at low to moderate doses by itself and using it sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed).

It is worth noting that ethylphenidate crystals are particularly abrasive and somewhat caustic to mucous membranes. Careless use will deteriorate the chosen [routes of administration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) so it is important to practice routine maintenance such as soaking the sinus cavity with water prior to and following insufflation.

It will also irritate lung tissue if inhaled, resulting in the production of phlegm and an irritated cough.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of ethylphenidate can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to many of the effects of ethylphenidate develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). ethylphenidate presents cross-tolerance with all [dopaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopaminergic) [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , meaning that after the consumption of ethylphenidate all [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) will have a reduced effect.

### Psychosis

Abuse of compounds within the stimulant class at high dosages for prolonged periods of time can potentially result in a stimulant psychosis that may present with a variety of symptoms (e.g., [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , or [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) ). A review on treatment for amphetamine, [dextroamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dextroamphetamine) , and [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) abuse-induced psychosis states that about 5–15% of users fail to recover completely. The same review asserts that, based upon at least one trial, [antipsychotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) medications effectively resolve the symptoms of acute amphetamine psychosis.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with Ethylphenidate should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Ethylphenidate may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.

- **[MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs)** - This combination may increase the amount of neurotransmitters such as dopamine to dangerous or even fatal levels. Examples include [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , and some [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressants) .
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - The neurotoxic effects of MDMA may be increased when combined with other stimulants.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.
