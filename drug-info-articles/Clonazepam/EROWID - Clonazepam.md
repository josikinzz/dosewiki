The Netherlands #
 
Clonazepam, like most benzodiazepeines, is available with a prescription in the Netherlands. Preparation, possession, adaption, delivery, providing and transport, of benzodiazepines are prohibited, because they are scheduled on "List II" of the "Opium Law". Possession of small quantities (for personal use) of prohibited substances is typically not prosecuted. Recreational use of benzodiazepines, is, as with any other substance, not prohibited in the Netherlands. 
Norway #
 
Clonazepam is considered a Class B prescription drug and considered a "narcotic" in "P IV", like schedule IV, which means that it is illegal to possess without a prescription in Norway. See [http://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2013-02-14-199](http://lovdata.no/dokument/SF/forskrift/2013-02-14-199) (thanks oe) (last updated Oct 23 2014)
