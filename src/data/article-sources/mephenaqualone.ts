**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) or [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Mephenaqualone** is a central nervous system (CNS) [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) of the [quinazolinone](/w/index.php?title=Quinazolinone&action=edit&redlink=1) class that acts as a [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) and [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) . It is an analogue of methaqualone, sharing a similar chemical structure and pharmacological effects.

## Chemistry

Mephenaqualone, or 3-(2-bromophenyl)-2-methyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone, is a compound of the quinazolinone class. Quinazolinone is a bicyclic structure containing a phenyl ring bound to another six-membered ring with two nitrogen members and a ketone group bound to R 4 . In mephenaqualone, this structure is substituted at R 2 with a methyl group and at R 3 with a 2-bromophenyl group, which differentiates it from methaqualone.

## Pharmacology

Mephenaqualone acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) sites, similar to methaqualone. It increases the activity of the GABA receptors in the brain and nervous system, leading to sedative and muscle relaxant effects. This interaction is responsible for the compound's sedative-hypnotic effects, which can lead to feelings of relaxation and drowsiness.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Mephenaqualone induces a strong sense of sedation and relaxation, making users feel lethargic and often leading to sleepiness or even unconsciousness at higher doses.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - Users may experience a mild to moderate physical euphoria, characterized by pleasant bodily sensations.
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)** - Muscle relaxation is a prominent effect, contributing to its use as a sedative.
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)** - Higher doses may result in a noticeable loss of motor control and coordination. ### Visual effects
 
- - **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - Users may notice a decrease in the sharpness of their vision.
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - At higher doses, mephenaqualone can cause double vision or a blurred visual field.
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports may be available on forums and websites dedicated to substance experiences.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity profile of mephenaqualone is not well-documented, but it is assumed to be similar to that of methaqualone. Overdosing on mephenaqualone can lead to severe sedation, respiratory depression, and potentially life-threatening symptoms. As with all CNS depressants, combining mephenaqualone with other depressants like alcohol or benzodiazepines significantly increases the risk of overdose and fatal respiratory depression.

## Tolerance and addiction potential

Mephenaqualone is highly addictive. Tolerance to its effects develops rapidly with repeated use, leading users to consume higher doses to achieve the same effects. Tolerance to the sedative-hypnotic effects develops within a few days of repeated administration. It presents cross-tolerance with all [gabaergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) , meaning that after the consumption of mephenaqualone, all compounds of the same class will have a reduced effect.

Abrupt discontinuation of mephenaqualone after prolonged use can lead to withdrawal symptoms such as increased anxiety, insomnia, and potential seizures, similar to withdrawal from other GABAergic substances.

## Legal status

- **Germany:** Mephenaqualone is currently legal, as it is classified as a designer drug and not specifically controlled under the BtMG (Narcotics Act). However, its legal status could be subject to change as more is learned about the substance and its effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **Other countries:** The legal status of mephenaqualone in other countries is largely unknown. It is not widely documented and may vary significantly depending on local laws regarding designer drugs and analogs of controlled substances.

Mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen) is a quinazolinone-class GABAergic and is an analogue of methaqualone that was first made in 1960 and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, hypnotic, and anxiolytic properties caused by its agonist activity at the β subtype of the GABAa receptor, and was used for the treatment of insomnia.  Mecloqualone is faster-acting but shorter-lasting than methaqualone and so was used only as a sleeping pill, in contrast to methaqualone, which was used as a general-purpose anxiolytic as well. Mecloqualone was never as widely used as methaqualone and is no longer prescribed because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose. In the United States it is a Schedule I non-narcotic (depressant) controlled substance with an ACSCN of 2572 and 30 grams annual aggregate manufacturing quota.
