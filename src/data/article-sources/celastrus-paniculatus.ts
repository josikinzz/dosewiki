## Subjective Experience

Celastrus Paniculatus has been used in traditional ayurvedic medicine for many
centuries. It has long been considered to offer a variety of benefits and address a
range of ailments, but it is most well known for the stimulation of both intellect and
memory. Indeed, to this day, Indian students are known to use it prior to revision
study and academic examinations.

My first experiment comprised the multi-dosing of 20+ 20+10 seeds over several
hours. For my second, I consumed a single dose of 40 seeds. In each case I chewed
the seeds for a few minutes and then swallowed with water.

On both occasions the outcome surprised me.

With nootropics generally, and certainly on a single dose, I usually feel that there
might be something there, and often I believe that there is, but it is not clear enough
to absolutely dismiss the chance that this is a placebo effect. It does tend to be
border-line.

Not with this.

I was absolutely certain that it was effective.

It induced an on focus clarity, and it delivered this the day after a fairly heavy night. I
should have been feeling a little fuzzy, but having munched down the seeds, the
opposite was the case.

The second exercise, which was undertaken some weeks after the first, confirmed its
efficacy.

Celastrus Paniculatus has a positive reputation, and a wide variety of claims continue
to be made about it. Here is just one list, which I found via a random search:

\`\`\`
"appetizer, emetic expectorant, sodorific, liver tonic, aphrodisiac, stimulant,
powerful brain tonic, stimulate intellect and sharpen memory, cure joint
pain, paralysis, rheumatism, weakness; seed oil enriches the blood, cures
abdominal complaints, stomachic, tonic, treats cough, asthma, leprosy,
headaches, leucoderma" ~ celastrus.com
\`\`\`
Obviously I cannot confirm most of these, but I can state categorically that it is
psychoactive. Within hours, on the specified dose, there was a clear, unambiguous
and beneficial effect on my mental acuity.

There was no euphoria or obvious stimulation to it, as far as I could tell, but I felt
confident and content whilst under its influence.

On retiring to bed I fell asleep without difficulty, and during the night I experienced a
multitude of dreams. In some, the frequently claimed aphrodisiacal properties did in
fact manifest themselves.

Repeat experiments yielded similar results to these first two encounters, certainly in
terms of clarity, sharpened focus and cognitive enhancement.

It would appear that this is a nootropic that actually works, and is one which
produces a return from a single dose. Continued research on the Internet, with
reference to field reports, indicates that the same opinion is shared by a substantial
number of individuals.

This again is a plant that is deserving of further experimentation. It isn’t one which
produces a high or a recreational trip, but it does provide considerable scope for
intellectual exploration and research.

## Summary
Celastrus paniculatus is a woody liana commonly known as black oil plant, climbing staff tree, and intellect tree (Sanskrit: jyotishmati ज्योतीष्मती, Hindi: mal-kangni माल-कांगनी, Chinese: deng you teng 灯油藤). This climbing shrub grows throughout India at elevations up to 1,800 m (5,900 ft).
C. paniculatus is a deciduous vine with stems up to 10 cm (3.9 in) in diameter and 6 m (20 ft) long with rough, pale brown exfoliating bark covered densely with small, elongated lenticles. The leaves are simple, broad, and oval, obovate or elliptic in shape, with toothed margins.

## Traditional medicine
Oil from the seeds is used as a traditional medicine in Indian Unani and Ayurvedic medicine.

## Poisonous relative
Celastrus paniculatus has a relative that grows in the United States that is poisonous (Celastrus orbiculatus), so identifying this plant carefully can be important.
