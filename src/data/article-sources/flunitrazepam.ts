This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pharmacologic actions similar to those of diazepam that can cause anterograde amnesia. Some reports indicate that it is used as a date rape drug and suggest that it may precipitate violent behavior. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug.

### Indication

For short-term treatment of severe insomnias, that are not responsive to other hypnotics.

### Pharmacodynamics

Flunitrazepam is a powerful hypnotic drug that is a benzodiazepine derivative. It has powerful hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. The drug is sometimes used as a date rape drug. In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for medical use, and is considered to be an illegal drug. It has however been approved in the United Kingdom and other countries.

### Mechanism of action

Benzodiazepines bind nonspecifically to benzodiazepine receptors BNZ1, which mediates sleep, and BNZ2, which affects affects muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, motor coordination, and memory. As benzodiazepine receptors are thought to be coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors, this enhances the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA receptor. Binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the site opens the chloride channel, resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the cell.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

A cytochrome P450 monooxygenase involved in the metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate, and reducing the second into a water molecule, with two electrons provided by NADPH via cytochrome P450 reductase (NADPH--hemoprotein reductase) (PubMed:18577768, PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Catalyzes the hydroxylation of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Hydroxylates PUFA specifically at the omega-1 position (PubMed:18577768). Catalyzes the epoxidation of double bonds of PUFA (PubMed:19965576, PubMed:20972997). Also metabolizes plant monoterpenes such as limonene. Oxygenates (R)- and (S)-limonene to produce carveol and perillyl alcohol (PubMed:11950794). Responsible for the metabolism of a number of therapeutic agents such as the anticonvulsant drug S-mephenytoin, omeprazole, proguanil, certain barbiturates, diazepam, propranolol, citalopram and imipramine. Hydroxylates fenbendazole at the 4' position (PubMed:23959307)

Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol)
 
Basics
 
by Erowid
 
DESCRIPTION #
 
Flunitrazepam is marketed as "Rohypnol" by Hoffman - La Roche in Latin America and Europe. It is sold as a treatment for insomnia as well as pre-anaesthetic medication. One of its primary actions is to cause anterograde amnesia, as well as general feelings of intoxication. It is used by some in the rave scene as a recreational psychoactive. While it is perhaps best known as a 'date rape drug' due to its use by a small number of people to facilitate date rape, this use is relatively rare. 
 
[ [Main Flunitrazepam Vault](https://erowid.org/flunitrazepam.shtml) ]
 
Dose #
 
Flunitrazepam is available in .5, 1 and 2 mg tablets (although the 2 mg tablets were phased out between 1996-1999).
 
Price #
 
Rohypnol is available on the black market for as little as \$4-5 per tablet and as high as \$15 per tablet.
 
[Law](https://erowid.org/flunitrazepam_law.shtml) #
 
Flunitrazepam is Schedule IV in the United States, but more importantly it is not approved by the FDA for human consumption so it is not available by prescription and is not legal to possess. Reportedly U.S. customs seizes even small quantities coming across the borders, even by those with valid prescriptions from other countries.

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 0.2 - 0.5 mg
- Light: 0.5 - 1 mg
- Common: 1 - 3 mg
- Strong: 3 - 4 mg
- Heavy: 4 - 6 mg +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 8 hours
- Onset: 20 - 30 minutes
- After effects: 2 - 24 hours
**Fatal [overdose](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Overdose) may occur when [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) are combined with other [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) such as [opiates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opiates) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [gabapentinoids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gabapentinoids) , [thienodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thienodiazepines) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or other [GABAergic substances](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA#GABA_receptors) .**
 
It is strongly discouraged to combine these substances, particularly in [common](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Common) to [heavy](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Heavy) doses.
**Flunitrazepam** (trade name **Rohypnol** ) is a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) substance of the [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) class that produces primarily [hypnotic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) and [amnesic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesic) , but also [anxiolytic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiolytic) , [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) and [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) effects when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Administered) .

Flunitrazepam was first synthesized in 1972 by Hoffmann-La Roche. It is used for the short term treatment of [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Insomnia) and as a preoperative sedative in some countries. It is approximately 10 times more potent by weight than [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) .

Users should note that [the sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) can be potentially dangerous or life-threatening for individuals using regularly for extended periods of time, sometimes resulting in seizures or death. It is highly recommended to taper one's dose by gradually lowering the amount taken each day for a prolonged period of time instead of stopping abruptly.

## History and culture

Flunitrazepam was discovered at Roche as part of the benzodiazepine work led by Leo Sternbach. It was first marketed in 1974 and entered the commerical market in Europe in 1975 under the name Rohypnol. In the 1980's it began to be available in other countries.

It may be better known as the date-rape drug Rohypnol (with the street name “roofie”). In 1998, due to the abuse of the drug and recreation, Roche modified their 1 mg tablets to make them less soluble and added a blue dye for easier detection in drinks.

In studies in Sweden, flunitrazepam was the second most common drug used in suicides, being found in about 16% of cases. In a retrospective Swedish study of 1587 deaths, in 159 cases benzodiazepines were found. In suicides when benzodiazepines were implicated, the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and [nitrazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nitrazepam) were occurring in significantly higher concentrations, compared to natural deaths.

## Chemistry

Flunitrazepam is classed as a nitro-benzodiazepine. It is the fluorinated N-methyl derivative of nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include nitrazepam (the parent compound), nimetazepam (methylamino derivative) and clonazepam (2ʹ-chlorinated derivative).

## Pharmacology

Benzodiazepines produce a variety of effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site and magnifying the efficiency and effects of the neurotransmitter [gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) by acting on its [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) . As this site is the most prolific inhibitory receptor set within the brain, its modulation results in the [sedating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedating) (or [calming effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) ) of Flunitrazepam on the nervous system.

The [anticonvulsant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticonvulsant) properties of benzodiazepines may be, in part or entirely, due to binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels rather than benzodiazepine receptors.

Flunitrazepam is known to induce anterograde amnesia in sufficient doses (individuals are unable to remember certain events that they experienced while under the influence of the drug). This effect could be particularly dangerous, if flunitrazepam is used to aid in the commission of sexual assault, because victims may be unable to clearly recall the assault, the assailant, or the events surrounding the assault.

80% of the flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed but the bioavailability in suppository form is closer to 50%.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

The general head space of flunitrazepam is described as one of intense sedation, sleepiness, relaxation, anxiety suppression, memory suppression and decreased inhibition similar to the headspace of higher doses of [diazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diazepam) and [temazepam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temazepam) .
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Flunitrazepam can produce extreme sedation and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state. At higher levels, this causes users to suddenly feel as if they are extremely sleep deprived and have not slept for days, forcing them to sit down and generally feel as if they are constantly on the verge of passing out instead of engaging in physical activities. This sense of sleep deprivation increases proportional to dosage and eventually becomes powerful enough to force a person into complete unconsciousness.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)**
- **[Muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression)**
- **[Seizure suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure_suppression)**
- **[Decreased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_heart_rate)**
- **[Decreased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - Flunitrazepam is known to cause feelings of heaviness in the body. This effect can range from motor impairment and difficulty moving at lower doses to complete lethargy or inability to stand up or move at high doses.
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - The euphoria felt on flunitrazepam is significantly stronger than that felt on other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** ### Paradoxical effects
 
- Paradoxical reactions to [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) such as increased seizures (in epileptics), aggression, increased anxiety, violent behavior, loss of impulse control, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur (although they are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1%). These paradoxical effects occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with mental disorders, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of flunitrazepam can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. It contains a large number of typical [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - Flunitrazolam can cause considerable anmesia.
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - The cognitive euphoria felt on flunitrazepam is significantly stronger than that felt on other [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) such as [alprazolam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alprazolam) .
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)**
- **[Emotion suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_suppression)** - Although this compound primarily suppresses anxiety, it also dulls other emotions in a manner which is distinct but less intensive than that of [antipsychotics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antipsychotic) .
- **[Delusions of sobriety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions)** - This is the false belief that one is perfectly sober despite obvious evidence to the contrary such as severe cognitive impairment and an inability to fully communicate with others. It most commonly occurs at heavy dosages.
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** - Flunitrazepam primarily suppresses short-term memory, resulting in forgetfulness, and/or disorganized behaviors.
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - At heavy doses, flunitrazepam can cause confusion. This effect is a result of the drug suppressing basic cognitive functions at heavy doses, such as comprehension, memory, and reasoning skills.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Due to flunitrazepam's heavy sedation and lethargy, doing any type of activity that requires moving, or high amounts of effort may be difficult to do on this compound, especially at higher doses.
- **[Language suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression)** - Flunitrazepam causes slurred speech and difficulty communicating words in a clear or coherent fashion.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - While most people report that benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam tend to result in states of dreamless sleep, the opposite effect has also been reported, and seems to be particularly prevalent when a user is experiencing withdrawal from GABAergic substances (with alcohol being one notable example). The cause for these differences remain unclear at this point in time. ### After effects
 
- - **[Rebound anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** - Rebound anxiety is a commonly observed effect with [anxiety relieving](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) substances like [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) . It typically corresponds to the total duration spent under the substance's influence along with the total amount consumed in a given period, an effect which can easily lend itself to cycles of dependence and addiction.
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - While benzodiazepines can be used as an effective [sleep-inducing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypnotic) aid, their effects may persist into the morning afterward, which may lead users to feeling "groggy" or "dull" for up to a few hours.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** or **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)**
- **[Residual sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Flunitrazepam](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Pharms_Flunitrazepam.shtml)

## Usage

### Preparation methods

- **[Volumetric liquid dosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing)** - If one's benzodiazepines are in powder form, they are unlikely to weigh out accurately without the most expensive of scales due to their extreme potency. To avoid this, one can dissolve the benzodiazepine volumetrically into a solution and dose it accurately based upon the methodological instructions linked within this tutorial [here](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Volumetric_liquid_dosing) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Flunitrazepam likely has a low toxicity relative to dose. However, it is potentially [lethal](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) when mixed with [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants) like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) or [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Lethal dosage

The oral [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) (lethal dose in 50% of the population) of flunitrazepam is 1200 mg/kg in mice and 415 mg/kg in rats.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Flunitrazepam is extremely physically and psychologically addictive.

Tolerance will develop to the sedative-hypnotic effects within a couple of days of continuous use. After cessation, the tolerance returns to baseline in 7 - 14 days. However, in certain cases, this may take significantly longer in a manner which is proportional to the duration and intensity of one's long-term usage.

Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing usage abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. For more information on tapering from benzodiazepines in a controlled manner, please see [this guide](http://www.benzo.org.uk/manual/bzcha02.htm) .

[Benzodiazepine discontinuation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Discontinuation) is notoriously difficult; it is potentially life-threatening for individuals regularly using to discontinue use without tapering their dose over a period of weeks. There is an increased risk of [hypertension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypertension) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and death. Drugs which lower the seizure threshold such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) should be avoided during withdrawal.

Flunitrazepam presents cross-tolerance with all [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , meaning that after its consumption, all benzodiazepines will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

Although many drugs are safe on their own, they can become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with other substances. The list below contains some common potentially dangerous combinations, but may not include all of them. Certain combinations may be safe in small doses of each but still, increase the potential risk of death. [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

- **[Depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressants)** ( *[1,4-Butanediol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/1,4-Butanediol) , [2-methyl-2-butanol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2-methyl-2-butanol) , [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturates) , [GHB](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GHB) / [GBL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GBL) , [methaqualone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methaqualone) , [opioids](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Opioids)* ) - This combination can result in dangerous or even fatal levels of [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . These substances potentiate the [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) and [amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia) caused by one another and can lead to unexpected loss of consciousness at high doses. There is also an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - This combination can result in an increased risk of vomiting during unconsciousness and death from the resulting suffocation. If this occurs, users should attempt to fall asleep in the [recovery position](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recovery_position) or have a friend move them into it.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - It is dangerous to combine benzodiazepines with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) due to the risk of excessive intoxication. Stimulants decrease the [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) effect of benzodiazepines, which is the main factor most people consider when determining their level of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the effects of benzodiazepines will be significantly increased, leading to intensified [disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition) as well as [other effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine#Subjective_effects) . If combined, one should strictly limit themselves to only dosing a certain amount of benzodiazepines per hour. This combination can also potentially result in severe dehydration if hydration is not monitored.

### Overdose

Benzodiazepine overdose may occur when a [benzodiazepine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine) is taken in large quantities or concurrently with other depressants. This is particularly dangerous with other GABAergic depressants such as [barbiturates](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Barbiturate) and [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) since they work similarly, but bind to distinct allosteric sites on the GABA A receptor. Thus their effects potentiate one another. Benzodiazepines increase the frequency in which the chlorine ion pore opens on the GABA A receptor while barbiturates increase the duration in which they are open, meaning when both are consumed, the ion pore will open more frequently and stay open longer . Benzodiazepine overdose is a medical emergency that may lead to a coma, permanent brain injury or death if not treated promptly and appropriately.

Symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include severe [thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration) , [slurred speech](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Language_suppression) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) , coma or death. Benzodiazepine overdoses may be treated effectively in a hospital environment, with generally favorable outcomes. Benzodiazepine overdoses are sometimes treated with [flumazenil](/w/index.php?title=Flumazenil&action=edit&redlink=1) , a GABA A antagonist . However, care is primarily supportive in nature.

## Effects
Flunitrazepam has a calming, relaxing, antispasmodic, anti-anxiety and sleep-inducing effect.
Taking benzodiazepines increases the effectiveness of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor. This triggers sedative (calming), hypnotic, anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving), anticonvulsant (anticonvulsant) and muscle-relaxing effects in the body. Benzodiazepines have a depressant effect on the central nervous system. The flow of information in the brain between the brain cells (neurons) is thereby reduced / disturbed and feelings and perceptions are dampened.
The breakdown of the individual active ingredients of benzodiazepines in the body is age-dependent and therefore varies from person to person.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
There is little information available on risks, toxicity, side effects and long-term consequences. Therefore, the general information on benzodiazepines applies:
When mixing with other downers (alcohol, GHB/GBL, heroin) there is a risk of respiratory paralysis!
Taking benzodiazepines can cause numerous undesirable side effects. In addition, regular and long-term use carries a very high risk of physical and psychological dependence. Benzodiazepines should only be taken as prescribed by a doctor and only for a short period of time (max. 4-6 weeks). Longer-term use should be discussed with the treating specialist. The dosages and duration of action of the individual benzodiazepines differ considerably.
Side effects of benzodiazepines may be as follows: Prolonged fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, impaired reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, headaches, dizziness, motor difficulties, visual disturbances, slowed breathing, muscle weakness, confusion, sexual dysfunction, aggression, outbursts of anger, restlessness, random movements, allergies, skin problems/rashes and speech and movement disorders. Some benzodiazepines can cause seizures in epileptics.

### Long-term Risks
Regular and long-term use can lead to psychological and physical dependence (very high dependence potential). Immediate discontinuation of the drug after prolonged use can lead to negative withdrawal symptoms (including dizziness, physical weakness, inner restlessness, tremors, sleep disturbances, headaches, sweating, nausea, hallucinations and depression).
In addition, seizures and memory disorders/loss and listlessness (hangover effects) can occur. In case of possible dependence, withdrawal should be discussed with a doctor beforehand and the withdrawal should be medically accompanied. It is extremely important that the dose is reduced gradually.

## Safer Use
- If medicines are obtained on the black market or on the internet and not from a pharmacy/medical facility, the contents are unclear. Have the medicine tested for the exact ingredients in a drug check!
- Do not rely on dosage information from colleagues who regularly use benzodiazepines. Due to habituation or dependence, their doses can be much higher and fatal for new users.
- Blisters of counterfeits may look identical to the original packaging.
- The simultaneous consumption of depressant substances such as alcohol, ketamine, GHB/GBL, nitrous oxide, opioids and/or other benzodiazepines is dangerous as there is an increased risk of vomiting and unconsciousness. The risk of suffocation is high!

**Flunitrazepam** (Also known as Narcozep, Rohypnol, Rohipnol, Roipnol, or Roofies) Is a very fast acting benzodiazepine that is used mostly as a Hypnotic for short-term treatment of Chronic or Severe Insomniacs that aren't responsive for other Hypnotics. Which is why that it is almost always used on a short-term basis. 

## History

It was developed by a team lead by Leo Sternbach at Hoffman La-Roche in 1963. Which showed that an N-Methyl & 2-Fluoro produced the most hypnotic effects. It was used in hospitals when deep sedation was needed. First entered the commerical market in Europe in 1975 as Rohypnol. In the 1980's it began to be available in other countries. In the United States it appeared in the later 1983-84. It came in doses of 1mg and 2mg. But due to its potency and potential for abuse, most European contries changed their drug laws and limited the dose to 1mg. In my countries the maximum dose per package (Prescription) was limited to 20 or 30mg's. In Germany there had been two changes in availability during a short period in the late 1990s. Which restricted the dose to 20mg per package. Soon after it was made to limit the dose to only 1mg. While ampoules containing the 2mg solution were not changed by Roche and have been handled as a controlled narcotic like Morphine. In the where Flunitrazepam is available for prescription as both 1mg and 2mg tablets, such as the Netherlands, generic alternatives are available for the 2mg tablets. In Asia and South America there are the original 2mg tablets from Roche. 

The newly designed 1mg tablets introduced in the 1990's by Roche for the European market are identical in all countries. Which are green (which contain a blue colouring) So that the tablets can only dissolve quickly in hot liquids, while turning the drink a blue colour and leaving a green residue in the beverage, which was introduced to prevent use as a date rape drug, and abuse. 

In the 2000's some European countries started to treat Flunitrazepam as a strong narcotic. 

Since November 2011 the drug is only available with a special narcotic prescription in Germany.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Flunitrazepam is classed as a Nitro-Benzodiazepine. It is the fluorinated N-Methyl derivative of Nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include Nitrazepam (which is the parent compound) Nimetazepam (Methylamino Derivative) and Clonazepam (The Chlorinated Derivative) 

The main pharmacological effect of Flunitrazepam are the enhancement of GABA at at the GABA(A) Receptor. Like with most other benzodiazepines, Flunitrazepam's pharmacological effects include sedation, muscle relaxation, reduction in anxiety, and anti-convulsive effects. 

80% of Flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed. Flunitrazepam has a medium half life of 18-26 hours. Which makes the effect persist throughout the next day. Flunitrazepam is lipophilic and is metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. The enzyme CYP3A4 is the main enzyme in its phase 1 metabolism in humans.`,
  "wikipedia": `# Flunitrazepam
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flunitrazepam*

Flunitrazepam, sold under the brand name Rohypnol among others, is a benzodiazepine used to treat severe insomnia and assist with anesthesia. As with other hypnotics, flunitrazepam has been advised to be prescribed only for short-term use or by those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis.
Flunitrazepam was patented in 1962 and came into medical use in 1974. Nicknamed "roofies" or "floonies", it is widely known for its use as a date rape drug.

## Use

In countries where this drug is used, it is used for treatment of severe cases of sleeping problems, and in some countries as a preanesthetic agent. These were also the uses for which it was originally studied.
It has also been administered as a concurrent dose for patients that are taking ketamine. Flunitrazepam lowers the side effects of the anesthetic (ketamine), resulting in less confusion in awakening states, less negative influence on pulse rate, and fewer fluctuations in blood pressure.

## Adverse effects

Adverse effects of flunitrazepam include dependency, both physical and psychological; reduced sleep quality resulting in somnolence; and overdose, resulting in excessive sedation, impairment of balance and speech, respiratory depression or coma, and possibly death. Because of the latter, flunitrazepam is commonly used in suicide among the elderly. When used in late pregnancy, it might cause hypotonia of the fetus.

### Dependence

Flunitrazepam, as with other benzodiazepines, can lead to drug dependence. Discontinuation may result in benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, characterised by seizures, psychosis, insomnia, and anxiety. Rebound insomnia, worse than baseline insomnia, typically occurs after discontinuation of flunitrazepam even from short-term single nightly dose therapy.

### Paradoxical effects

Flunitrazepam may cause a paradoxical reaction in some individuals, including anxiety, aggressiveness, agitation, confusion, disinhibition, loss of impulse control, talkativeness, violent behavior, and even convulsions. Paradoxical adverse effects may even lead to criminal behaviour.

### Hypotonia

Benzodiazepines such as flunitrazepam are lipophilic and rapidly penetrate membranes and, therefore, rapidly cross over into the placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including flunitrazepam in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in hypotonia, also known as floppy baby syndrome.

### Other

Flunitrazepam impairs cognitive functions. This may appear as lack of concentration, confusion and anterograde amnesia—the inability to create memories while under the influence. It can be described as a hangover-like effect which can persist to the next day. It also impairs psychomotor functions similar to other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drugs; falls and hip fractures were frequently reported. The combination with alcohol increases these impairments. Partial, but incomplete tolerance develops to these impairments.
Other adverse effects include:

Slurred speech
Gastrointestinal disturbances, lasting 12 or more hours
Vomiting
Respiratory depression in higher doses

### Special precautions

Benzodiazepines require special precaution if used in the elderly, during pregnancy, in children, in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals, and in individuals with comorbid psychiatric disorders.
Impairment of driving skills with a resultant increased risk of road traffic accidents is probably the most important adverse effect. This side-effect is not unique to flunitrazepam but also occurs with other hypnotic drugs. Flunitrazepam seems to have a particularly high risk of road traffic accidents compared to other hypnotic drugs. Extreme caution should be exercised by drivers after taking flunitrazepam.

## Interactions

The use of flunitrazepam in combination with alcoholic beverages synergizes the adverse effects, and can lead to toxicity and death.

## Overdose

Flunitrazepam is a drug that is frequently involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. Overdose of flunitrazepam may result in excessive sedation, or impairment of balance or speech. This may progress in severe overdoses to respiratory depression or coma and possibly death. The risk of overdose is increased if flunitrazepam is taken in combination with CNS depressants such as ethanol (alcohol) and opioids. Flunitrazepam overdose responds to the GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil, which thus can be used as a treatment.

## Detection

As of 2016, blood tests can identify flunitrazepam at concentrations of as low as 4 nanograms per millilitre; the elimination half-life of the drug is 4–12 hours. For urine samples, metabolites can be identified for 60 hours to 28 days, depending on the dose and analytical method used. Hair and saliva can also be analyzed; hair is useful when a long time has transpired since ingestion, and saliva for workplace drug tests.
Flunitrazepam can be measured in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma flunitrazepam concentrations are usually in a range of 5–20 μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically as a nighttime hypnotic, 10–50 μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving and 100–1000 μg/L in victims of acute fatal overdosage. Urine is often the preferred specimen for routine substance use monitoring purposes. The presence of 7-aminoflunitrazepam, a pharmacologically active metabolite and in vitro degradation product, is useful for confirmation of flunitrazepam ingestion. In postmortem specimens, the parent drug may have been entirely degraded over time to 7-aminoflunitrazepam. Other metabolites include desmethylflunitrazepam and 3-hydroxydesmethylflunitrazepam.

## Pharmacology

The main pharmacological effects of flunitrazepam are the enhancement of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, at various GABA receptors.  All benzodiazepines work by enhancing the effect of GABA receptors, which, when active, allow chloride ions to enter the neuron. Negative ions such as chloride inhibit the ability of neurons to fire.  It is this stimulation of GABA receptors which is responsible for the depressant effects of benzodiazepines. Flunitrazepam shows high affinity for the α-5 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, which causes some of its unique side effects, such as amnesia.
While 80% of flunitrazepam that is taken orally is absorbed, bioavailability in suppository form is closer to 50%.
Flunitrazepam has a long half-life of 18–26 hours, which means that flunitrazepam's effects after nighttime administration persist throughout the next day. This is due to the production of active metabolites. These metabolites further increase the duration of drug action compared to benzodiazepines that produce nonactive metabolites.
Flunitrazepam is lipophilic and is metabolised by the liver via oxidative pathways. The enzyme CYP3A4 is the main enzyme in its phase 1 metabolism in human liver microsomes.

## Chemistry

Flunitrazepam is classed as a nitro-benzodiazepine. It is the fluorinated N-methyl derivative of nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include nitrazepam (the parent compound), nimetazepam (methylamino derivative) and clonazepam (2ʹ-chlorinated derivative).
Flunitrazepam has a melting point of around 170 degrees Celsius.

## History

Flunitrazepam was discovered at Roche as part of the benzodiazepine work led by Leo Sternbach; the patent application was filed in 1960 and it was first marketed in 1972.

Due to use of the drug for date rape and recreation, in 1998 Roche modified the formulation to give lower doses, make it less soluble, and add a blue dye for easier detection in drinks. It was never marketed in the United States, and by 2016 had been withdrawn from the markets in Spain, France, Norway, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

## Society and culture

### Recreational and illegal uses

#### Recreational use

A 1989 article in the European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology reports that benzodiazepines accounted for 52% of prescription forgeries in Sweden, suggesting that benzodiazepines were a major prescription drug class of abuse. Nitrazepam accounted for 13% of forged prescriptions, and accounted for 44% of forgeries specifically for benzodiazepines while flunitrazepam, diazepam, and oxazepam accounted for the majority of the rest of benzodiazepine forgeries. Prescription forgeries for other benzodiazepines marketed in Sweden (alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam, clobazam, and bromazepam) were negligible. When calculated in relation to utilization, the narcotic analgesics codeine, pentazocine, and ketobemidone were at the top of the list for the highest number of overall prescription forgeries, suggesting a higher abuse potential of these drugs. In neighboring Finland, temazepam accounts for roughly 40–50% benzodiazepine prescription forgeries annually, while flunitrazepam accounts for approximately ~15% of benzodiazepine prescription forgeries.
Flunitrazepam and other sedative hypnotic drugs are detected frequently in cases of people suspected of driving under the influence of drugs. Other benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines (anxiolytic or hypnotic) such as zolpidem and zopiclone (as well as cyclopyrrolones, imidazopyridines, and pyrazolopyrimidines) are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of potential for addiction for benzodiazepines and similar drugs.

#### Suicide

In studies in Sweden, flunitrazepam was the second most common drug used in suicides, being found in about 16% of cases. In a retrospective Swedish study of 1,587 deaths, in 159 cases benzodiazepines were found. In suicides when benzodiazepines were implicated, the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and nitrazepam occurred in significantly higher concentrations compared to natural deaths. Of the 159 deaths where any benzodiazepines were found, 4 deaths were caused by benzodiazepines alone (in the other 155 cases, benzodiazepines were combined with something else). One conclusion of the study was that flunitrazepam and nitrazepam might be more toxic than other benzodiazepines available in the Swedish market.

#### Drug-facilitated sexual assault

Flunitrazepam is known to induce anterograde amnesia in sufficient doses; individuals are unable to remember certain events that they experienced while under the influence of the drug, which complicates investigations.  This effect could be particularly dangerous if flunitrazepam is used to aid in the commission of sexual assault; victims may be unable to clearly recall the assault, the assailant, or the events surrounding the assault.
While use of flunitrazepam in sexual assault has been prominent in the media, as of 2015 it appears to be fairly rare, and use of alcohol and other benzodiazepine drugs in date rape appears to be a larger but underreported problem.
In a 2001 study, the benzodiazepines midazolam and temazepam were the two most common benzodiazepines utilized for date rape.

#### Drug-facilitated robbery

In the United Kingdom, the use of flunitrazepam and other "date rape" drugs have also been connected to stealing from sedated victims. An activist quoted by a British newspaper estimated that up to 2,000 individuals are robbed each year after consuming drinks spiked with powerful sedatives, making drug-assisted robbery a more commonly reported problem than drug-assisted rape.

### Regional use

Flunitrazepam is a Schedule III drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.

In Australia, as of 2013 the drug was authorized for prescribing for severe cases of insomnia but was restricted as a Schedule 8 medicine.
In France, as of 2016 flunitrazepam was not marketed.
In Germany, as of 2016 flunitrazepam is an Anlage III Betäubungsmittel (controlled substance which is allowed to be marketed and prescribed by physicians under specific provisions) and is available on a special narcotic drug prescription as the Rohypnol 1 mg film-coated tablets and several generic preparations (November 2016).
In Ireland, flunitrazepam is a Schedule 3 controlled substance with strict restrictions.
In Japan, flunitrazepam is marketed by Japanese pharmaceutical company Chugai under the trade name Rohypnol and is indicated for the treatment of insomnia as well as used for preanesthetic medication.

In Norway, on January 1, 2003, flunitrazepam was moved up one level in the schedule of controlled drugs and, on August 1, 2004, the manufacturer Roche removed Rohypnol from the market there altogether.
In South Africa, Rohypnol is classified as a Schedule 6 drug. It is available by prescription only, and restricted to 1 mg doses.

In Iceland, flunitrazepam is a controlled substance available from Mylan. It is prescribed for severe insomnia and is sometimes used before surgery to induce a calm, relaxed state of mind for the patient.
In Sweden, flunitrazepam is a List II drug (substances with medicinal uses) under the Narcotics Control Act (1968). It was previously available from Mylan, but has been removed from the market in January 2020.
In the United Kingdom, flunitrazepam is not licensed for medical use and is a controlled drug under Schedule 3 and Class C.
In the United States, the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is considered to be an illegal drug; as of 2016 it is Schedule IV. 21 U.S.C. § 841 and 21 U.S.C. § 952 provide for punishment for the importation and distribution of up to 20 years in prison and a fine; possession is punishable by three years and a fine. Travelers travelling into the United States are limited to a 30-day supply. The drug must be declared to US Customs upon arrival. If a valid prescription cannot be produced, the drug may be subject to Customs search and seizure, and the traveler may face criminal charges or deportation.

### Names

Flunitrazepam is marketed under many brand names in the countries where it is legal. It also has many street names, including "roofie" and "ruffie". It is also known as Circles, Forget Me Pill, La Rocha, Lunch Money Drug, Mexican Valium, Pingus, R2, and Roach 2.
