# Caffeine
*Source: https://thedrugclassroom.com/video/caffeine/*

Caffeine is a popular naturally occurring stimulant that is widely used in the form of coffee, tea, chocolate, and soft drinks. It is also used by itself in tablets and as a powder, which is a more potentially dangerous way to administer the drug.

It doesn’t offer particularly recreational stimulant effects and instead provides a sort of “pure stimulation.” Along with providing cognitive stimulation, caffeine can improve physical performance.

The drug is usually legal around the world, though there can be some restrictions on the sort of products that can be sold.

Caffeine’s stimulation is weaker than what’s provided by amphetamines and other common stimulants. High doses can cause strong negative effects that are similar to what’s seen with other stimulants, including restlessness, tremors, and jaw clenching.

Some deaths from caffeine have been recorded, but they are very rare. The LD50 is estimated to be around 150 mg/kg, which is equivalent to ~75 cups of coffee.
