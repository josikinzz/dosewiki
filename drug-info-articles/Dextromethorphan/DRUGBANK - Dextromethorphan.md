# Dextromethorphan
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00514*

## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as morphinans. These are polycyclic compounds with a four-ring skeleton with three condensed six-member rings forming a partially hydrogenated phenanthrene moiety, one of which is aromatic while the two others are alicyclic.

### Background

Dextromethorphan is a levorphanol derivative and codeine analog commonly used as a cough suppressant and also a drug of abuse.
11
Although similar in structure to other opioids, it has minimal interaction with opioid receptors.
11
Dextromethorphan was granted FDA approval before 3 December 1957.
11
,
17

### Indication

Dextromethorphan is indicated in combination with
brompheniramine
and
pseudoephedrine
in the treatment of coughs and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergies or the common cold.
14
Dextromethorphan is also used in combination with
guaifenesin
as an over-the-counter product to relieve a cough.
15
Dextromethorphan in combination with
quinidine
is indicated in the treatment of pseudobulbar affect.
13

### Pharmacodynamics

Dextromethorphan is an opioid-like molecule indicated in combination with other medication in the treatment of coughs and pseudobulbar affect.
14
,
15
,
13
It has a moderate therapeutic window, as intoxication can occur at higher doses.
10
Dextromethorphan has a moderate duration of action.
13
Patients should be counselled regarding the risk of intoxication.
10

### Mechanism of Action

Sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1
Agonist
Glutamate receptor ionotropic, NMDA 3A
Antagonist

### Absorption

A 30mg oral dose of dextromethorphan  reaches a C
max
of 2.9 ng/mL, with a T
max
of 2.86 h, and an AUC of 17.8 ng*h/mL.
7

### Metabolism

Dextromethorphan can be N-demethylated to 3-methoxymorphinan by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9 or O-demethylated to dextrorphan by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9.
6
Dextrorphan is N-demethylated by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, while 3-methoxymorphinan is O-demethylated by CYP2D6.
6
Both are metabolized to form 3-hydroxymorphinan.
6
Dextrorphan and 3-hydroxymorphinan are both O-glucuronidated or O-sulfated.

### Half-life

Dextromethorphan has a half life of 3-30 hours.
8

### Toxicity

A dextromethorphan overdose may present as nausea, vomiting, stupor, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, tachycardia, hyperexcitability, toxic psychosis, ataxia, nystagmus, dystonia, blurred vision, changes in muscle reflexes, and serotonin syndrome.
13
Overdose should be managed through symptomatic and supportive measures.

### Mechanism of action

Dextromethorphan is a low-affinity uncompetitive NMDA antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist.
13
It is also an antagonist of α3/β4 nicotinic receptors.
12
However, the mechanism by which dextromethorphan's receptor agonism and antagonism translate to a clinical effect is not well understood.

Substrate

### General Function

UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) that catalyzes phase II biotransformation reactions in which lipophilic substrates are conjugated with glucuronic acid to increase the metabolite's water solubility, thereby facilitating excretion into either the urine or bile (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:19022937, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:8798464). Catalyzes the glucuronidation of endogenous steroid hormones such as androgens (epitestosterone, androsterone) and estrogens (estradiol, epiestradiol) (PubMed:16595710, PubMed:18719240, PubMed:19022937, PubMed:23288867, PubMed:8798464)
