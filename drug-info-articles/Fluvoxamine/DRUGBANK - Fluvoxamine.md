# Fluvoxamine
*Source: https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00176*

## Overview

### Description

A medication used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

### Background

Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Fluvoxamine has been in use in clinical practice since 1983 and has a clinical trial database comprised of approximately 35,000 patients. It was launched in the US in December 1994 and in Japan in June 1999. As of the end of 1995, more than 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with fluvoxamine.

### Indication

Indicated predominantly for the management of depression and for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)
Label
. Has also been used in the management of bulimia nervosa
2
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Fluvoxamine, an aralkylketone-derivative agent
Label
, is one of a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that differs structurally from other SSRIs
1
. It is used to treat the depression associated with mood disorders. It is also used on occassion in the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder and anxiety
1
. The antidepressant, antiobsessive-compulsive, and antibulimic actions of Fluvoxamine are presumed to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin
Label
,
1
,
2
.
In vitro
studies show that Fluvoxamine is a potent and selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake
2
. Moreover, apart from binding to σ1 receptors
2
, fluvoxamine has no significant affinity for adrenergic (alpha1, alpha2, beta), cholinergic, GABA, dopaminergic, histaminergic, serotonergic (5HT
1A
, 5HT
1B
, 5HT
2
), or benzodiazepine receptors; antagonism of such receptors has been hypothesized to be associated with various anticholinergic, sedative, and cardiovascular effects for other psychotropic drugs
1
. Furthermore, some studies have demonstrated that the chronic administration of Fluvoxamine was found to downregulate brain norepinephrine receptors (as has been observed with other drugs effective in the treatment of major depressive disorder), while others suggest the opposite
3
.

### Mechanism of Action

Sodium-dependent serotonin transporter
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Well absorbed, bioavailability of fluvoxamine maleate is 53%
Label
.

### Metabolism

Fluvoxamine is metabolized extensively by the liver

### Half-life

15.6 hours
Label
.

### Toxicity

Fluvoxamine is a member of antidepressants that possess an increased risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and behaviour (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages including and and below 24) in short-term studies of major depressive disorder and other psychiatric disorders
Label
.
Fluvoxamine maleate tablets are not approved for use in pediatric patients except for patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)
Label
.
Side effects include anorexia, constipation, dry mouth, headache, nausea, nervousness, skin rash, sleep problems, somnolence, liver toxicity, mania, increase urination, seizures, sweating increase, tremors, or Tourette's syndrome
Label
.

### Drug Interactions

This information should not be interpreted without the help of a healthcare provider. If you believe you are experiencing an interaction, contact a healthcare provider immediately. The absence of an interaction does not necessarily mean no interactions exist.

1,2-Benzodiazepine
The risk or severity of adverse effects can be increased when 1,2-Benzodiazepine is combined with Fluvoxamine.
Abacavir
Fluvoxamine may decrease the excretion rate of Abacavir which could result in a higher serum level.
Abametapir
The serum concentration of Fluvoxamine can be increased when it is combined with Abametapir.
Abatacept
The metabolism of Fluvoxamine can be increased when combined with Abatacept.
Abciximab
The risk or severity of hemorrhage can be increased when Fluvoxamine is combined with Abciximab.

### Food Interactions

Avoid alcohol.
Avoid grapefruit products.
Limit caffeine intake.
Take with or without food. The absorption is unaffected by food.

### Mechanism of action

The exact mechanism of action of fluvoxamine has not been fully determined, but appears to be linked to its inhibition of CNS neuronal uptake of serotonin
Label
,

,
2
. Fluvoxamine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the serotonin reuptake pump of the neuronal membrane, enhancing the actions of serotonin on 5HT

Label
.

### Route of elimination

Nine metabolites were identified following a 5 mg radio labelled dose of fluvoxamine maleate, constituting approximately 85% of the urinary excretion products of fluvoxamine
Label
. The main human metabolite was fluvoxamine acid which, together with its N-acetylated analog, accounted for about 60% of the urinary excretion products
Label
. Approximately 2% of fluvoxamine was excreted in urine unchanged
Label
. Following a 14C-labelled oral dose of fluvoxamine maleate (5 mg), an average of 94% of drug-related products was recovered in the urine within 71 hours

### General Function

Catalyzes the transport of the major hydrophobic bile salts, such as taurine and glycine-conjugated cholic acid across the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes in an ATP-dependent manner, therefore participates in hepatic bile acid homeostasis and consequently to lipid homeostasis through regulation of biliary lipid secretion in a bile salts dependent manner (PubMed:15791618, PubMed:16332456, PubMed:18985798, PubMed:19228692, PubMed:20010382, PubMed:20398791, PubMed:22262466, PubMed:24711118, PubMed:29507376, PubMed:32203132). Transports taurine-conjugated bile salts more rapidly than glycine-conjugated bile salts (PubMed:16332456). Also transports non-bile acid compounds, such as pravastatin and fexofenadine in an ATP-dependent manner and may be involved in their biliary excretion (PubMed:15901796, PubMed:18245269)
