## SYNTHESIS
A mixture of 62.9 g N-methylformanilide and 71.3 g of POCl3 was allowed to stand for 0.5 h producing a light claret color. There was then added 30.9 g of 1,3,5- trimethoxybenzene and the mixture heated on the steam bath for 2 h. The reaction mixture then was poured into chipped ice, and allowed to stir for several h. The dark gummy mess was extracted with 2Ã100 mL Et2O (this was discarded) and then with 4Ã200 mL CH2Cl2. The latter extracts were pooled, and stripped of solvent under vacuum yielding 14 g of an amber solid. This was recrystallized from 80 mL boiling MeOH (with decolorizing charcoal employed and filtration of the boiling solution through paper) to give 10.0 g of 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde as a white crystalline solid with a mp of 115â116 Â°C. The literature values are generally one-degree ranges, and they are reported as high as 121 Â°C. The malononitrile adduct was prepared from a solution of 0.5 g aldehyde and 0.5 g malononitrile in 10 mL warm MeOH treated with a drop of triethylamine. There was an immediate formation of a yellow crystalline mass which was removed by filtration, washed with EtOH, and air dried. The yield of 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzalmalononitrile was 0.5 g and the mp was 174â175 Â°C. Anal. (C13H12N2O3) N.

A solution of 5 g 2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde in 20 g nitroethane was treated with 1.0 g of anhydrous ammonium acetate and held on the steam bath for 24 h. The excess solvent/reagent was stripped from the deep-red colored solution under vacuum yielding a residue that spontaneously set to a crystalline mass. This was well triturated under 5 mL MeOH, filtered, and washed with 3 mL additional MeOH to give 5.4 g of 2-nitro-1-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)propene as yellow crystals. The mp of the crude material was 135â142 Â°C which could be raised to 147â148 Â°C by recrystallization from EtOH. The use of an alternate procedure for the synthesis of this nitrostyrene, using acetic acid as solvent and a stoichiometric amount of nitroethane (and ammonium acetate as catalyst), gave very poor yields. The use of butylamine as catalyst gave considerably better results.

A suspension of 50 g LAH in 1 L anhydrous THF was placed under an inert atmosphere, stirred magnetically, and brought to a gentle reflux. There was added a total of 56.9 g 2-nitro-1-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)propene as a saturated solution in THF. This was achieved by letting the condensed THF drip through a Soxhlet thimble containing the nitrostyrene with direct addition to the reaction mixture. The solubility was extremely low. The stirred mixture was maintained at reflux for 36 h, generating a smooth creamy gray color. After being brought to room temperature, the excess hydride was destroyed by the patient addition of 50 mL H2O, followed with 50 mL 15% NaOH (still some heat evolved) and then 150 mL additional H2O. Stirring was continued until the insoluble salts were white and loose. These solids were removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with additional THF. The combined filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the 73 g of pale amber residue dissolved in 200 mL IPA, neutralized with approximately 50 mL concentrated HCl, and diluted with 2 L anhydrous Et2O. A lower, oily phase separated slowly set up as a crystalline mass. This was removed by filtration, Et2O washed, and allowed to air dry to constant weight. The weight of 2,4,6-trimethoxyamphetamine hydrochloride was 41.3 g and the color was an off-white. There was a tendency to discolor upon air exposure. The mp was 204â205 Â°C which was increased to 207â208 Â°C upon recrystallization from IPA. The literature gives a mp of 214â215 Â°C for this salt after isolation and purification as the picrate salt (with a mp 212â213 Â°C from EtOH).


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 35 mg) âMy body was tingling all over, and there were times when walking was unsteady. Thinking was a little difficult, as I was quite intoxicated most of the day (all of the day, now that I think that over). To accomplish anything, such as toasting the toast in the toaster, was difficult. And things were so funny most of the time. Setting the table for supper, six hours later, proved to be hilarious. I like to think of the day as a mixture of the mad hatterâs tea party, and a trip to the moon. We were all still intoxicated at bedtime, whatever time that was. Had difficult time sleeping. If I were to repeat, would go lighter in dosage, I feel.â

(with 40 mg) âThis experiment was begun at noon of a cool rainy day. Almost all of the day had to be spent indoors, without benefit of sunshine, This is worth mentioning because there was, for the first eight hours of the experiment, a decided feeling of inner chill which might not have occurred so strongly had it been a warm day. Most, if not all, of the other eight subjects also reported the same chill. There was some visual sparkle which persisted throughout. At the two hour point a minor but persistent stomach queasiness came on, preceded by a diarrhea-like bowel movement. There was no impairment of speech, but there was some halting quality to all thought processes. It was easy to talk about personal matters, but there did not seem to be a significant insight increase. Appetite for food was lessened. Sleep was decidedly difficult after the effects of the material seemed otherwise gone.â

(with 40 mg) âAs the experience grows in intensity for the first four hours, I feel a strange mixture of plateaus, exuberance, and strong negative feelings, all replacing each other. I found myself inside a stout, hemispherical shell, curled up in the solid part, thoroughly walled off but absolute master within the shell, calling all shots, making all decisions, in complete control. Moving beyond the half-shell meant becoming vulnerable, which I refused to do. Consequently my difficulty in hearing what other people say, becoming involved in their perceptions and lives. I keep relationships shallow, pull away inside my shell rather than become involved. I like to be by myself. This was a great revelation; I had never seen it before. This material had an enormous drive. I feel extremely grateful for exposing a very deep personal problem.â

(with 50 mg) âMy previous try at this level produced a record that said, âalteration of consciousness, but no visual, no anything,â and oh my, surprise! It was very, very active, visual, colorful, etc., etc. Good talking, clear and steady control of body, despite intense energy flow. Extremely funnyâgreat humor, wonderful laughter.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
Here, there is the blatant, parallel call from TMA-6. It can serve, as the 2,4,6-counterpart, as a similar template compound. And the first indicators are that, in keeping the 2,6-dimethoxy aspect intact, a completely analogous series could be made, again with modifications of the 4-position. These have been named the psu-series, or psi-series, as an abbreviation for the prefix, pseudo, and can be differentiated from the 2,4,5-things with the use of the Greek letter âPsiâ. Thus there is the Î¨-DOM (called Z-7 in this book, and certainly an active compound), and Î¨-DOB, Î¨-DOET, Î¨-DOI, and the Î¨-ALEPH. And, of course, the Î¨-2C-X counterparts (Î¨-2C-D, Î¨-2C-B, Î¨-2C-E, Î¨-2C-I, Î¨-2C-T)). I would expect all of them to be active and, certainly, some of them interesting. They will be considerably more difficult to synthesize. However, some of them, specifically things such as Î¨-2C-T-4, have already been prepared, and are being evaluated.

([Erowid Note: Gamma vs Psi Greek letters : The original digital transcription of PiHKAL included an error throughout that the uppercase Greek letter Psi was transcribed as âGammaâ. Hopefully we have fixed these problems now.]

One of the guiding premises of this Book II was to make all recipes employ commercially available materials as starting materials. And in the case of TMA-6, the required benzaldehyde (2,4,6-trimethoxybenzaldehyde) is an easily obtained trade item from any of several supply houses. Why not start the recipe there? Why tell how to make it from 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (also presently available from commercial sources) and how to make the ether in turn, from phloroglucinol? This simply reflects a valid paranoia of our times. Today the aldehyde is available (at \$2/g) and can be easily purchased. But tomorrow? What about in the year 2003? Who can tell what will, or will not, be easily available then? There might be a world-wide acknowledgment that the âwar on drugsâ is more destructive than any drug itself could ever be, and every law that had been written in the attempt to dictate human behavior will have been transformed into a force that truly educates and allows choice. This might really happen. But maybe, on the other hand, no fine chemicals may be permitted to be held in any hands, at any price, except for those of licensed chemists and in authorized laboratories. The black market price for the aldehyde might be \$1000/g with another \$1000 for protection.

But, it will be impossible to remove phloroglucinol from availability. It is available as a natural component in the free form, in sources as diverse as the cones of the Sequoia sempervirens (the coast redwood tree) and species of Camillia (that provides the leaves of our morning tea). And combined with a molecule of glucose in the form of its glucoside, it is called phlorin, and it is present in the discarded rinds of almost all citrus fruits as well as the resins from many of the Eucalyptus species. And one step yet further back into nature, there is a dihydrochalcone glucoside called phloridzin which practically drips out of all parts of the apple and pear trees except for the apple or pear itself. It, on base hydrolysis, gives phlorin, which on acid hydrolysis gives phloroglucinol, which when dissolved in methanol and sulfuric acid gives â Q. Nature is indeed most bountiful.

The phenethylamine homologue of TMA-6 is well known, but is virtually unexplored pharmacologically. The above benzaldehyde with nitromethane in glacial acetic acid containing ammonium acetate gave the appropriate Î²-nitrostyrene as yellow crystals with a mp 177â177.5 Â°C. This, with LAH in ether, gave 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenethylamine (2,4,6-TMPEA, or 2C-TMA-6) as the picrate salt (mp 204â205 Â°C) or the hydrochloride salt (mp 234â235 Â°C). It has been shown not to be a substrate to the soluble amine oxidase from rabbit liver, a property it shares with mescaline, but whether it is or is not active in man is at present unknown.

**2,4,6-Trimethoxyamphetamine** (also known as **TMA-6** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) class. It has been reported to produce a complex mixture of [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [hallucinogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects that distinguish it from other psychedelic phenethylamine derivatives like the [2C-x](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-x) or [DOx](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DOx) series.

TMA-6 has no history of human usage prior to the 1991 publication of its synthesis and pharmacology in the book [PiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PiHKAL) ("Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved") by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) , who called it "one of the most rewarding and pleasurable of the methoxylated amphetamines". Since then it has been regarded as a novelty in the psychedelics community and is made available for sale only rarely by clandestine laboratory operations.

In terms of its subjective effects, it is known for its lack of classic psychedelic visuals compared to other hallucinogenic phenethylamines and is known instead for its unique stimulating body-high and intoxicating headspace.

Anecdotal reports suggest that TMA-6 is unpredictable and dose-sensitive substance that can produce uncomfortable amounts of body load, nausea, overstimulation, and inconsistencies between experiences.

In modern times, TMA-6 is used rarely as a [recreational drug](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recreational_drug_use) and a putative [entheogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogen) . It has no documentation of being sold on the streets [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] and is almost exclusively obtainable as an obscure gray area [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) through the use of online vendors.

## Chemistry

TMA-6, or 2,4,6-trimethoxyamphetamine, is a molecule of the [substituted amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine) class. Amphetamines are substituted phenethylamines, being comprised of a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH 2 ) group through an ethyl chain and a methyl group bound to the alpha carbon R α . TMA-6 contains methoxy functional groups CH 3 O- attached to carbons R 2 and R 4 and R 6 of the amphetamine backbone.

## Pharmacology

TMA-6's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . However, the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the user, TMA-6 is usually considered to be extremely stimulating at levels which do not become overwhelming, resulting in a shakiness and unsteadiness of the hands but encouraging one to move around, run, dance, climb and generally engage in physical activities. In comparison, other more commonly used psychedelics such as [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) are generally sedating and relaxed.
- **[Spontaneous tactile sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_tactile_sensations)** - The "body high" of TMA-6 is manifested as somewhat intense in comparison to most classical psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . The sensation itself can be described as a constantly present yet somewhat mild energetic pins and needles sensation that encompasses a person’s entire body. It is usually felt over every square inch of the skin, but occasionally manifests itself in the form of a continuously shifting tingling sensation that travels up and down the body in spontaneous waves.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - Feelings of enhanced tactile sensation are consistently present at moderate levels throughout most TMA-6 trips.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Mild to extreme nausea is reported when consumed in moderate to high dosages and either passes once the person has vomited or gradually fades by itself as the peak sets in.
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)** - This effect is usually only present at higher dosages, but can be particularly uncomfortable.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of TMA-6 are described as powerful mental stimulation along with undertones of intoxication that can increase the connectivity and rate of conceptual thinking without being overwhelming. The total sum of these cognitive components regardless of the setting generally includes: 
- **[Empathy, love, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_love,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This component is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are weaker and sharper than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) , but still can elevate one's mood.
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)** 
- **[Ego death](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_death)**

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational TMA-6 use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because TMA-6 has very little history of human usage. Anecdotal evidence from people within the psychonaut community who have tried TMA-6 suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

Though largely unstudied TMA-6 is largely considered to be not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with consumption. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of TMA-6 are built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). TMA-6 presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of TMA-6 all psychedelics and stimulants will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol lowers the seizure threshold and [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) may act as triggers for seizures, particularly in those who are predisposed to them. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Stimulants affect many parts of the brain. Combined with psychedelics, stimulation can turn into uncontrollable [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [panic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) , [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) and [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) . This interaction may cause elevated risk of psychosis. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Lithium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_(medication))** - Lithium is often used as treatment for bipolar disorder. It may possibly cause elevated risk of seizures and psychosis due to its [glutaminergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Glutamate) and [GABAergic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .

## Summary
2,4,6-Trimethoxyamphetamine (2,4,6-TMA), also known as TMA-6 or ψ-TMA-2, is a psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine, amphetamine, and Ψ-PEA families. It is one of the positional isomers of trimethoxyamphetamine (TMA).

## Use and effects
In his 1991 book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved), Alexander Shulgin gave a dose range for TMA-6 of 25 to 50 mg and a duration of 12 to 16 hours. Threshold effects occur at 20 mg, a full hallucinogenic state occurs at 30 to 40 mg, and erratic results have been reported for 40 to 80 mg. The drug is said to have about 8 to 10 times the potency of mescaline.
The effects of TMA-6 have been reported to include ease with concepts and writing, body tingling, walking unsteadiness, thinking difficulty or intoxication, difficulty with tasks, funniness, hilarity, and laughter, difficulty sleeping, inner chill, visual sparkle, stomach queasiness, diarrhea, reduced appetite, fluctuating emotions, personal insights, visuals, colors, and feelings of "energy flow". Additional reported effects include enjoyable lightheadedness, euphoria, perceptual distortion, synesthesia, and nausea.

### Pharmacodynamics
TMA-6 shows affinity for serotonin receptors in rat stomach fundus strips (A2 = 525 nM) as well as in rat brain membranes (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 25,000 nM). In a later study, it showed no affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A or dopamine D2 receptors (Ki = >10,000 nM). Subsequently, it was reported to be a potent serotonin 5-HT2A receptor full agonist, with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration of 29.2 nM and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 107%. The drug was inactive as a monoamine reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent in rat brain synaptosomes (IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration and EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = >100,000 nM, respectively). The drug is a potent monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitor, with an IC50Tooltip half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 400 nM. This is in contrast to TMA (3,4,5-TMA) and TMA-2 (2,4,5-TMA), which are inactive in this regard.
TMA-6 fully substitutes for the psychedelic drugs DOM and 5-MeO-DMT in rodent drug discrimination tests. It also partially substitutes for dextroamphetamine in rodent drug discrimination tests.

### Synthesis
The chemical synthesis of TMA-6 has been described.

### Analogues
A number of analogues of TMA-6 with a 2,4,6- substitution pattern have been described, such as Ψ-DOM and ψ-2C-T-4, among others. Alexander Shulgin only limitedly explored the 2,4,6- substitution pattern.

## History
TMA-6 was first described in the scientific literature by 1954. Alexander Shulgin discovered its psychedelic effects in 1964 and first described its hallucinogenic effects in the literature in 1969, where he stated its potency relative to mescaline and noted that these findings were previously unpublished. Shulgin subsequently gave the drug the name TMA-6 in 1970. He more thoroughly described TMA-6 in PiHKAL in 1991. The drug was encountered as a novel designer drug in Europe in 2009.

### Legal status
As a positional isomer of TMA, TMA-6 is said to be a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States.
