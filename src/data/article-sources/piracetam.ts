## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as alpha amino acids and derivatives. These are amino acids in which the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (alpha carbon), or a derivative thereof.

### Background

Piracetam is a nootropic drug in the racetams group, with chemical name 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide. It shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid and is a cyclic derivative of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However its mechanism of action differ from that of endogenous GABA. Piracetam has neuroprotective and anticonvulsant properties and is reported to improve neural plasticity
1
. Its efficacy is documented in cognitive disorders and dementia, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell anemia although the clinical application in these conditions is not yet established. Piracetam has effects on the vascular system by reducing erythrocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium, hindering vasospasms and facilitating microcirculation
1
.
Originally marketed by UCB Pharma in 1971, piracetam was the first nootropic drug to modulate cognitive function without causing sedation or stimulation
1
. It is not approved for any medical or dietary use by the FDA. In the UK, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus, but is used off-label for other conditions such as learning difficulties in children, memory loss or other cognitive defects in the elderly, and sickle-cell vaso-occlusive crises
4
. Evidence to support its use for many conditions is unclear.

### Indication

Indicated in adult patients suffering from myoclonus of cortical origin, irrespective of aetiology, and should be used in combination with other anti-myoclonic therapies
5
.

### Pharmacodynamics

Piracetam is known to mediate various pharmacodynamic actions:
Neuronal effects
:
Piracetam modulates the cholinergic, serotonergic, noradrenergic, and glutamatergic neurotransmission although the drug does not display high affinity to any of the associated receptors (Ki >10μM). Instead, piracetam increases the density of postsynaptic receptors and/or restore the function of these receptors through stabilizing the membrane fluidity
1
. In the forebrain of aging mice, the density of NMDA receptors was increased by approximately 20% following 14 days of piracetam treatment. Based on the findings of various animal and human studies, the cognitive processses including learning, memory, attention and consciousness were enhanced from piracetam therapy without inducing sedation and psychostimulant effects
5
. Piracetam mediate neuroprotective effects against hypoxia-induced damage, intoxication, and electroconvulsive therapy
5
.
In two studies involving alcohol-treated rats with evidences of withdrawal-related neuronal loss, piracetam was shown to reduce the extent of neuronal loss and increase the numbers of synapses in the hippocampus by up to 20% relative to alcohol-treated or alcohol-withdrawn rats
1
. This suggests that piracetam is capable in promoting neuroplasticity when recoverable neural circuits are present
1
. Although the mechanism of action is not fully understood, administration of piracetam prior to a convulsant stimulus reduces the seizure severity and enhances the anticonvulsant effectiveness of conventional antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and diazepam
3
.
Vascular effects
:
Piracetam is shown to increase the deformability of erythrocytes, reduce platelet aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, reduce the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium and capillary vasospasm. In healthy volunteers, piracetam mediated a direct stimulant effect on prostacycline synthesis and reduced the plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand’s factors (VIII: C; VIII R: AG; VIII R: vW) by 30 to 40%
5
. Potentiated microcirculation is thought to arise from a combination of effects on erythrocytes, blood vessels and blood coagulation
1
.

### Absorption

Piracetam displays a linear and time-dependent pharmacokinetic properties with low intersubject variability over a large range of doses. Piracetam is rapidly and extensively absorbed following oral administration with the peak plasma concentration is reached within 1 hour after dosing in fasted subjects. Following a single oral dose of 3.2 g piracetam, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 84 µg/mL. Intake of food may decrease the Cmax by 17% and increase the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) from 1 to 1.5 hours. Tmax in the cerebrospinal fluid is achieved approximately 5 hours post-administration
4
.
The absolute bioavailability of piracetam oral formulations is close to 100% and the steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within 3 days of dosing
4
.

### Metabolism

As large proportion of total piracetam administered is excreted as unchanged drug, there is no known major metabolism of piracetam
4
.

### Half-life

The plasma half life of piracetam is approximately 5 hours following oral or intravenous administration. The half life in the cerebrospinal fluid was 8.5 hours
4
.

### Toxicity

The cases of overdose with piracetam is rare. The highest reported overdose with piracetam was oral intake of 75g which was associated with diarrhea and abdominal pain; the signs were most likely related to the extreme high dose of sorbitol contained in the used formulation. In cases of acute, significant overdosage, stomach emptying by gastric lavage or induced emesis is recommended as there are no known antidotes for piracetam
4
. Management for an overdose will most likely be symptomatic treatment and may include hemodialysis, where the extraction efficacy of the dialyser is 50 to 60% for the drug
4
.
Oral LD50 in a mouse acute toxicity study was 2000 mg/kg

### Mechanism of action

Piracetam interacts with the polar heads in the phospholipids membrane and the resulting mobile drug-lipid complexes are thought to reorganize the lipids and influence membrane function and fluidity
1
. Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide
2
. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion
1
. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function
4
such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation
1
.
Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level
1
. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow
1
.

### Volume of distribution

Vd is approximately 0.6L/kg. Piracetam may cross the blood-brain barrier as it was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid following intravenous administration
4
. Piracetam diffuses
to all tissues except adipose tissues, crosses placental barrier and penetrates the membranes of isolated red blood cells
4
.

### Protein binding

Piracetam is not reported to be bound to plasma proteins
4
.

### Route of elimination

Piracetam is predominantly excreted via renal elimination, where about 80-100% of the total dose is recovered in the urine. Approximately 90% of the dose of piracetam is excreted in the urine as unchanged drug
4
.

### Clearance

The apparent total body clearance is 80-90 mL/min
4
.

U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**Piracetam**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Un-Scheduled
 
Piracetam is an uncontrolled sustance in the United States meaning it is legal to possess without a license or prescription. Sales, distribution, and labelling are regulated by FDA rules if sold for human consumption. 
 
 Piracetam was available from vendors inside the United States during the 2000s, but in 2010 we were told that the FDA told vendors to stop stocking it. One vendor reports that in May 2011 the FDA seized their Piracetam and Aniracetam stocks. (unconfirmed) (thanks PT) (last updated June 13 2011)
 
INTERNATIONAL LAW #
 
Australia #
 
Piracetam (Nootropil) is currently available for sale in Australia only by prescription, but may be imported legally for personal use amounts (up to '3 months supply'). As of May 1, 2007, Piracetam will be placed in Schedule 4, requiring that importation for personal use will also require a prescription. See [Australian Government "Importing medicines for personal use" guidelines](http://www.tga.gov.au/docs/html/bringmed/intoaust.htm) and [Notes on Piracetam Legal Status in Australia](https://erowid.org/piracetam_law1.shtml) . (thanks TG)
 
Belgium #
 
Piracetam (Nootropil) reportedly does not require a prescription to legally purchase and possess in Belgium. (unconfirmed) (thanks J)

## Dosage & Duration

### Oral

**Dosage:**
- Threshold: 0.25 - 0.5g
- Light: 0.5 - 2g
- Common: 2 - 3g
- Strong: 3 - 5g
- Heavy: 5g +

**Duration:**
- Total: 4 - 8 hours
- Onset: 30 - 90 minutes

**Piracetam** ( **2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide** ) is a [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) substance of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) class. It is a derivative of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) .

Piracetam was first synthesized in 1964 by Corneliu E. Giurgea and other scientists at the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

In the United Kingdom, piracetam is prescribed mainly for myoclonus (spasmodic jerky contraction of groups of muscles), but is used off-label for other conditions. In the United States, it is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for any medical use and it is not permitted to be sold as a dietary supplement. However, it is still readily available and sold through online vendors. As a "smart drug", it is reported to enhance cognitive functions including memory, intelligence, and attention.

The active dose of piracetam is 100 times than that of [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] making it both the earliest and least potent [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) . The standard piracetam dose for adults is between 1,200-4,800mg a day. The largest effective dose is 1,600mg taken three times a day for a total of 4,800mg.

## Chemistry

Piracetam, or 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine-acetamide, is a synthetic compound of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family. Racetams share a [pyrrolidine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pyrrolidine) nucleus, a five member nitrogenous ring with a ketone bonded oxygen at R 2 . This 2-pyrrolidone ring is bound to the terminal carbon of an acetamide group, an ethyl amide chain with a ketone bond (C=O) at the alpha carbon.

Piracetam shares structural similarity to the neurotransmitter [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) , its pyrrolidine core is the cyclic counterpart of [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) and could theoretically be converted into an acetamide chain through a hydrolysis reaction into [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) .

## Pharmacology

Piracetam's mechanism of action, as with [racetams](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a [sedative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedative) or [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) . Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. [GABA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/GABA) brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by piracetam.

Among other things, it has also been found to increase blood flow and oxygen consumption in parts of the brain, but this may be a side effect of increased brain activity rather than a primary effect or mechanism of action for the drug. Piracetam also improves the function of the neurotransmitter [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes.

Although it is not fully understood how, it's these multiple complex mechanisms of action which result in piracetams [nootropic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) effects.

## Subjective effects

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

In comparison to the effects of other nootropics such as [noopept](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Noopept) , this compound can be described as focusing primarily on physical stimulation over that of cognitive stimulation.
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - The stimulation which piracetam presents can be considered as primarily subtle, comparable to that of [caffeine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Caffeine) .
- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** - Some users suggest that this effect may be alleviated with a choline source such as [choline bitartrate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Choline_bitartrate) , [alpha-GPC](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alpha-GPC) or [citicoline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citicoline) .
- **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** ### Sensory effects
 
- - **[Acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Auditory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- - **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)** or **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)**
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Memory enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Thought connectivity](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_connectivity)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: Piracetam](https://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Piracetam.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Adverse effects, although rare and of short duration are limited to [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [insomnia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness) , [drowsiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches) and [agitation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability) . It may be safe for up to 18 months in humans at doses of 3.2g daily with one year-long study in ambulatory patients with Alzheimer's using 8g daily reporting no side effects. However, a possibility for adverse drug-drug interactions persists for piracetam due to it interacting with blood in an anti-clotting manner. Therefore, caution should be taken when pairing piracetam with pharmaceutical blood thinning agents such as Warfarin or potent nutraceutical options and individuals prone to brain hemorrhaging are discouraged from using piracetam.

Patients with renal insufficiency should also not use piracetam.

No fatal overdoses associated with piracetam use have been reported as of 2016. In animal models (rodents, dogs, and marmoset), an [LD50](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LD50) failed to be established at the dosage of 8-10g/kg.

Regardless, it is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Lethal dosage

The median lethal dosage (LD50) of piracetam has not been officially published as it has low abuse potential, but the typical dosage is two grams once to three times a day.

### Dependence and abuse potential

The chronic use of piracetam can be considered as not addictive with a low potential for abuse. It does not seem to be capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users.

Tolerance to many of the effects of piracetam develops with prolonged and repeated use. This results in users having to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the same effects. After that, it takes about 3 - 7 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 1 - 2 weeks to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). Piracetam may presents cross-tolerance with all [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropic) , meaning that after the consumption of piracetam certain [nootropics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nootropics) such as [aniracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Aniracetam) and [pramiracetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pramiracetam) may have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

Piracetam showed nonselective MAO activity in a rat study. Piracetam and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) are a potentially dangerous combination. It is likely that MAOIs could increase the effects of piracetam unpredictably. Taking this chemical while on prescription MAOIs is strongly discouraged.

## Legal status

Piracetam, being a member of the [racetam](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Racetam) family, currently is legally available to buy and sell in most countries, but may still vary by region.

- **Czech Republic:** Piracetam is not regulated and can be bought in a pharmacy.
- **Germany:** Piracetam is a prescription medicine, according to Anlage 1 AMVV.
- **Switzerland:** Piracetam is listed as a "Abgabekategorie B" pharmaceutical, which requires a prescription. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **United Kingdom:** Piracetam and other racetams are prescription only drugs; however, there is no penalty for possession or importing them.
- **New Zealand:** Piracetam is considered a prescription drug, and as such will be seized by the Ministry of Health. It is not able to be imported without a signed note from a doctor.

**Piracetam** was the first Racetam created, and has since served as the basis for other more potent racetams created after its discovery in 1964. It has been known as a "staple" in the nootropic community, along with [caffeine](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Caffeine).

## History

Piracetam was first synthesized in 1964 by scientists at the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB, led by Corneliu E. Giurgeal, who were struck by its ability to boost mental functioning in healthy individuals along with its apparent safety, Fiurgea coined the term nootropics to describe it and similar substances.

Piracetam (Trade name "Nootropil") was launched clinically by UCB in the early 1970's, and is now used in many European countries.

## Usage

Piracetam has wide variety of uses, varying from Clotting to Depression to Cerebral trauma. However, it is primarily used off-label as a nootropic. It has a history of being used to treat cognitive impairment; according to a meta-analysis of human studies, it improves general cognition when given as a supplement to people in a state of cognitive decline. Piracetam enhances cellular membrane fludity - this mechanism explains why Piracetam is able to improve cognition. Piracetam is as effective as aspirin when it comes to preventing blood clotting, which makes it a useful supplement after cardiovasular trauma.

## Dosage

Dosages from 400mg to 4800mgs are considered safe. Some literature recommend an "attack dose" in the range of 1600mg to 2400mg for the first few days to initiate a response in people seeking cognitive enhancing effects. Start with a low-normal dose around 800mg's. Some report that they could feel strong effects at 800mg's on the first day. On subsequent days at the same dosage the effects were not as noticable. It is unclear wheather "optimal" benefits are obtained from daily use over time or if occasional use has the most benefits. If possible work with your doctor.

## Duration

It is recommended to take three times daily, at 800mg-1600mg. The duration is around 3-5 hours.

## Effects

It's recommended to take a Choline source with Piracetam and most other Racetams.

### Postive

- Help with memory recollection

- Spatial memory

- Learning capacities

- Intelligence boost (In some)

### Neutral

- Increased libido

- hypersexuality

### Negative

- Anxiety

- Insomnia

- Irritability

- Headaches (Which can usually be avoided with Choline)

- Agitation

- Nervousness

- Tremors

- Hyperkinesia

### After Effects

There may be discontinuation symptoms if used for a prolonged period of time, it is recommended to taper in these situations.

## Harm Reduction

Start low with this substance and work your way up to your "optimal" dosage. As with most of the Racetam family, it will take a week or more to reach full effects.

See [Dissociative Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Dissociatives#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

### Potentiators

Piracetam is said to increase the effects of alcohol and amphetamines. It's recommended that alcohol be avoided as one of the reported effects of piracetam is increased flow of blood to the brain, which could increase damage and intoxication. Piracetam supposedly reduces the effects of dissociatives.

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

IUPAC: 2-(2-oxopyrroliin-1-yl)acetamide.

Shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure as Pyroglutamic Acid. It is the cyclic derivative of GABA.

It's MOA is not fully understood (as with most Racetams). The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. A positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels, thus leading to an increased neuron excitability. It has been found to increase blood flow and oxygen consumption in parts of the brain but this may be a side effect of increased brain activity, rather than a primary effects of MOA of the drug.

Piracetam improves the function of the neurotransmitter Acetylcholine via Nuscarinic Cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. It may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. It is also thought to increase cell membrane permeability. It also may exert its global effect of brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels. While in the brain, it appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which is a part of the electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of the mitochondria of some intermediaries of the Krebs Cycle.

Some research shows that it may be clinically useful in treating alcoholism and alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

### LD50

In rats 5600mg/kg (Orally)

In mice 20000mg/kg (Orally)

### Reactivity

It is stable at room temperature, best way to store would be in a cool place inside an amber vial.

Reactive with oxidizing agents.

Non-corrosive in presence of glass.

### Polymerization

Does not occur.

## Legal status

- Australia: Prescription only.

- UK: Prescription Only but not controlled.

- US: Not FDA approved, yet is not prescribed. Legal to posses/use.

Piracetam is a drug that has efficacy in cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell anemia; sources differ on its usefulness for dementia. Piracetam is sold as a medication in many European countries. Piracetam in the United States is not approved for general use.
Piracetam is in the racetams group, with chemical name 2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide. It is a cyclic derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA and shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Related drugs include the anticonvulsants levetiracetam and brivaracetam, and the putative nootropics aniracetam and phenylpiracetam.

## Efficacy

### Dementia

A 2001 Cochrane review concluded that there was not enough evidence to support piracetam for dementia or cognitive problems. A 2005 review found some evidence of benefit in older subjects with cognitive impairment. In 2008, a working group of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the trials of piracetam for dementia were flawed.
There is insufficient evidence of piracetam as a treatment for  vascular dementia.

### Depression and anxiety

Some sources suggest that piracetam's overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety is higher than on improving memory. However, depression is reported to be an occasional adverse effect of piracetam.

### Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

Several clinical trials have looked at piracetam's efficacy as a treatment for ADHD. Many of these have found that the drug fails to deliver the same therapeutic effects as current standard treatments for the disorder. However, more than one study has found piracetam to be highly synergistic with standard ADHD therapies, accelerating and potentiating their therapeutic effects. One 2008 clinical trial found that the combination of piracetam and atomoxetine was more effective than atomoxetine alone.
While piracetam may be an effective adjuvant therapy for ADHD (when used with specific medications), there is no evidence that it is effective when used in isolation.

### Other

Piracetam may facilitate the deformability of erythrocytes in capillary which is useful for cardiovascular disease.
Peripheral vascular effects of piracetam have suggested its use potential for vertigo, dyslexia, Raynaud's phenomenon and sickle cell anemia. There is no evidence to support piracetam's use in sickle cell crisis prevention or for fetal distress during childbirth. There is no evidence for benefit of piracetam with acute ischemic stroke, though there is debate as to its utility during stroke rehabilitation.

### Anti-vasospasm

Piracetam has been found to diminish erythrocyte adhesion to vascular wall endothelium, making any vasospasm in the capillary less severe. This contributes to its efficacy in promoting microcirculation, including to the brain and kidneys.

## Side effects

Symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, headache, agitation, tremor, and hyperkinesia are occasionally reported. Other reported side effects include somnolence, weight gain, clinical depression, weakness, increased libido, and hypersexuality.
According to a 2005 review, piracetam has been observed to have the following side effects: hyperkinesia, weight gain, anxiety, somnolence, depression, and weakness.
Piracetam reduces platelet aggregation as well as fibrinogen concentration, and thus is contraindicated to patients with cerebral hemorrhage.

### Toxicity

The LD50 for oral consumption in humans has not been determined. The LD50 is 5.6 g/kg for rats and 20 g/kg for mice, indicating extremely low acute toxicity. For comparison, in rats the LD50 of vitamin C is 12 g/kg and the LD50 of table salt is 3 g/kg.

## Mechanisms of action

Piracetam's mechanism of action, as with racetams in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor, although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. GABA brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by piracetam
Piracetam increases the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. Furthermore, piracetam may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. Piracetam is thought to increase cell membrane permeability. Piracetam may exert its global effect on brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels (i.e., Na+, K+). It has been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain, apparently in connection to ATP metabolism, and increases the activity of adenylate kinase in rat brains. Piracetam, while in the brain, appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which is a part of the electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of some intermediates of the Krebs cycle through the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Piracetam inhibits N-type calcium channels. The concentration of piracetam achieved in central nervous system after a typical dose of 1200 mg (about 100 μM) is much higher than the concentration necessary to inhibit N-type calcium channels (IC50 of piracetam in rat neurons was 3 μM).

## History

Piracetam was first made some time between the 1950s and 1964 by Corneliu E. Giurgea. There are reports of it being used for epilepsy in the 1950s.

## Society and culture

In 2009 piracetam was reportedly popular as a cognitive enhancement drug among students.

### Legal status

Piracetam is an uncontrolled substance in the United States, meaning it is legal to possess without a license or prescription. Use of piracetam in food, supplements, medical devices, insecticides, infant formula, cosmetics, animal feed, animal drugs, tobacco products, and drugs is unlawful and constitutes an act of misbranding.

### Regulatory status

In the United States, piracetam is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Piracetam is not permitted in compounded drugs or dietary supplements in the United States. Like most research chemicals, it has been available over-the-counter, self-regulated, and third-party lab tested by many U.S. companies for decades. Nonetheless it is still, for the purposes of U.S. law, a "New Drug" as defined by 21 U.S. Code § 321(p)(1).
In the United Kingdom, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug for adults with myoclonus of cortical origin, irrespective of cause, and should be used in combination with other anti-myoclonic therapies.
In Japan, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug.
In the Czech Republic, piracetam is available without prescription.
Piracetam has no DIN in Canada, and thus cannot be sold, but can be imported for personal use in Canada.
In Hungary, piracetam was a prescription-only medication, but as of 2020, no prescription is required and piracetam is available as an over-the-counter drug under the name Memoril Mite, and is available in 600 mg pills.
