Higher doses I find relaxing and mildly visual, can be very nice. As someone mentioned on here I think things seem to be stretched and warped. Vaping is VERY intence. Did two hits last night and was very enjoyable, kind of like psychedelic crack. beware heart rate shot through the roof, not something you would want to be doing on the regular.

A social Enhancer lol!? Dude this shit makes it hard to even talk during the peak and even after. I do not think it feels like an Amphetamine at All it gives you Munchies. Whatever that above guy took I question.

try a low dose sometime then? i was never saying 75 mg would be good for a night out. 


tbh, tho i'm not even clear what you are trying to say... it seems like you may *always *have a hard time talking.


i agree its not actually amphetamine and it won't help anyone study. 

just try a low dose...im sure you'll figure it out.

**LSD + 5-Meo-DALT**


I researched 60mg of the 5-meo-dalt at a rave the other night [+00:00 40mg caps, + 01:20 20mg raw]. Raged out the hardest I have since August of 2011. The trip was very mild and stoney/energetic. Not much happening with OEV's; mebbe some movement/wall breathing/light color phosphors. When I closed my eyes and raged out, the CEV's were pretty fucking cool; but compared to something like 400mics of LSD and staring at a wall, I had a hard time fully examining the visuals/fractals from the 5-meo-dalt. it was like trying to remember an image from a dream. I remember during the show I would blink really fast and the CEV's would transfer onto OEV's, giving people auras around them and other things I cannot describe- it didn't last long though. The mindfuck was oh-so light and gave me a light "wow" sensation. coming down and looking out my apartment window; everything seemed jolly, fresh, and beautiful. interesting weird mild psyche.


I am going to another show soon and I am tempted to try around 60mg 5-meo-dalt with 200-300mics of LSD. Would this be a safe combination? I feel as if the L could help focus on the CEV's of 5-meo-dalt. IMO, that'd be AWESOME. Is this a silly notion or a valid research topic?

The combo should be fine, it's not dangerous or anything if that's what you meant to ask. Also, when trying combinations that you haven't attempted before, be cautious in your dosage.

thanks. and yeah I was not sure if it was safe or not, over thinking it. 


200-300mics LSD then at around 2-3hr[20-15min before main dj comes on] + 50mg 5-meo-dalt


I think that will be a good time~!

I am confident that i can handle this tryptamine combo. 300mic is how much i usually need for an enjoyable, not overwhelming trip. might do 200mic though... 

50mg 5-meo-dalt should defiantly be interesting admist an L peak, hehe.

I'm glad someone else likes 5-meo-dalt for a rave setting, I find it the tryptamine version of 2C-B. 40mg and liquor was good enough for me.

I smoked it, tastes MINGING. Intensely floral and synthetic tasting.


Found it to just be an anxious "rush" with the feeling of overwhemledness, intense hunger and muscle weakness. Along with hints that visuals might appear, but no, everything just looks a little more "sharp".


I'd compare it to a cannabinoid overdose without the fear or panic.

I took ~70mg (mixed with water, oral) on sunday evening and it was VERY intense. Everything was covered in bright coloured swirling patterns and the body high was awesome, I had that overwhelming urge to move coupled with the orgasmic loss of strength (named because it also happens to me after orgasm, you know, the weak knee syndrome ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)).


I read a lot of people here having crappy/boring/not-worth-it experiences and I just can't see how, it's a strange situation. As with all other Psychs, I find company potentiates the trip 100-fold, maybe you guys should try tripping socially?

I found the same, and drinking it (as above) also tasted disgusting. The only way I can see to avoid this is to bomb it in a rizzla maybe?

Bombing it works fine, I've always bombed it and it comes on in 10-15 minutes on an empty stomach.

The stuff doesn't give me very strong visuals, but it's more so mental tofu than 2C-D even.  I've vaped it and found that to be quite uneventful.  

@psychedelic crack: ya pretty much.  The first gram I got of this stuff, I killed in less than a week.  "Tripped" almost the entire time, and I never do that anymore.  It feels more like an ultra-nootropic than a psychedelic to me.  I can function perfectly well in society on it, drive fine, etc.

22mg made me feel pretty terrible. It gave me a bad headache. (I may have been due for a headache). 


18mg wasn't too bad for me... but it wasn't very good either.


This chem lack in comparison to the other chems I got. I'd rather eat 2c-c or even low dose foxy (if I want to stick with the tryptamine buzz)

I've been experimenting with this chem for some time now and several things have been noted:

1. set and setting are more important than any other chem I've come across, so much so that I thought I'd been ripped off with two purchases I made, only to be proven wrong at a later date....as a result I've now got about 20g to get through!!

2. I find 40mg is my comfortable dose - orally taken in gelcaps. Full/empty stomach makes a huge difference in on-set time. Feelings of nausea seem to be bought about by wind and a good burp will clear it, no problem ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

3. A night of partying, 1st dose of evening MDMA/mxe/mpa (200/20/40mg), followed about 4 hours later by 5-meo-dalt/mxe/mpa (40/20/40mg) is sublime, but a whole night (8 hours or so) is required. Just as the MDMA is tailing off, the 5-meo-dalt kicks in and makes it a whole wonderful something else - I can happily dance 8 hours solid on that at 50 yrs of age...and still be dancing on the way back home!! :D

4. It is perfectly possible to be taken by surprise by this chemical - I've had it from no effect at all, 2 hours to come on and coming on within mins, just as I've climbed in to the car for a 5 minute journey immediately after dropping the cap. I always take the dose orally in capsules. - As a result of this I will no longer be driving after taking it, no matter how long I think I've got before it hits - it can be fast and furious!!

5. It potentiates beautifully with mxe/mpa, if you like a fast n furious come up, followed by a sublime trip.

6. It appears to mix well with 3-meo-pcp - I've tried it twice now, again at reasonable doses, 2/3 my normal dose for each chemical and both times have ended up with a constant comfortable level trip where neither chemical has dominated and an evening of lovely headspace ensued with no probs eating, communicating or sleeping within a relatively short time of taking (around 4 hours).

7. I had the most amazing life affirming trip on it after a weekend of abuse - driving 250 miles, partying hard and no sleep for the best part of 48 hours - took it with a cup of tea, just before getting some sleep - it was my 4th dose of the weekend (40mg) didn't expect anything to happen due to no reserves left and tolerance levels due to repeated dosing, but thought I might wake up about 4 hours later in a nice post trip headspace. Before I'd made my tea it was hitting me fast n furious. Sat with cuppa in garden watching sunrise through mist and garden coming in to vital life - 1 hour of pure bliss, then a cold shower and slept like a baby that sleeps really well!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

8. I love this chemical.....I always feel well rested and recovered at the end of a 5-Meo-DALT trip - it's like someone has hit the reset button and all is understood and well with the world  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've played around with 5-meo-dalt a few times now and honestly I've taken a real liking to it, last night was the best I've had so far:


Took orally 20-22mgs at bout 4am coming down off a night on MPA & booze (had dosed orally 80mgs, 60mgs then another 60mgs + 15mgs 6APB + 20mgs mxe at intervals between 9pm and 1am roughly + a few beers)  also split 40 mgs MXE into 3 bumps which I had between 4 & 6.  Seemingly the DALT transported me from feeling pretty shit coming down to this state of carefree, calm, serenity.  I felt a relaxing warmth, and just layed around half watching a ridiculously good girl on girl porno.  Quite a trippy feeling with mild closed eye visuals, and with eyes open I twice hallucinated some geometrical shapes flying about - cool but literally they were like just there for a flash and then gone.  Looking through some photos was the coolest though, if you focussed on them they slowly seemed to have this dimensional depth, and this life-like look, & were moving really slowly.  I must've passed out around 6ish, I came to abruptly at about 7.15 with very little memory of the preceding night (this has come back by now though) and felt this wierd sense of panic like there was something I needed to urgently sort out, had all these complicated thoughts and didn't fully understand what was going on, but in trying to figure out what it was I needed to so I gradually realised that this was just some kind of dream and the scary feeling had pretty much dissipated within 5 mins.


When it was wearing off by 8 or 9 I got up and did a few chores cleaning the place (all be it moving quite slowly, possibly since I'd now taken 2 etizolams planning to go to sleep before deciding I didn't want to just yet), had a cup of tea and managed to force down a slice of toast and a protein shake.  Had a shower, then went and layed down with another 10mgs DALT & a couple of 10mg mexy bumps, was alright but not as eventful as the first time, was asleep by 12, and up at 5pm in a pretty good mood.


General thoughts:

- davem's advice posted above is good advice, I definately agree with what he's saying

- dosage is really something to consider with this stuff, bear in mind Shulgin only did amounts between 12 & 20mg!

- There really isn't that much info out there about 5-meo-dalt so all the more reason to be careful, start low, work up etc

- I've read that there's a lot of variation in the purity.

- There are both freebase and salt versions, & this coupled with chosen ROI can lead to considerable variation in effects.

 (above report relates to the freebase which I dosed orally)

I experimented a bit with 5-Meo-Dalt during the holidays. One 30+50mgs and one 85mgs insuflated trips, which were not really intense. And, one 110mgs insuflated dose. I was really sick on this one at the 1hour mark (puking), and after I've been in a confused state for an another hour or so. Overstimulated, and I guess someone less experimented with drugs than me could have easily loss it.


There's a sexual energy associated with this drug.


85mgs insuflated felt like the right spot for me. I looked at the midnight mass on TV at X-Mas on that dose, and it was so beautiful that I cried while looking at it.

**5-meo- DALT smoking question?**


I have just got hold of a gram of 5-meo-DALT and tried drnopping around 50mg which seemed to do nothing except provided nothing but weak stimulant effects. I tried snorting 15mg more and more of the same but barely felt any increase. I dont have access to a vaporizer and have no foil. So was thinking would it be possible to just sprinkle it in a rollie or something? Probably a dumb question but I'm pretty lazy lol

Aluminum foil is pretty easy to get, no? I've only tried this one a couple times but it vaporized from foil just fine. Very strange sensation; I could tell something was "off" but couldn't put my finger on it. Slight color and music enhancement, racing thoughts, etc.

How many people here have experience with > 100mg (orally)? My friend's been trying it at very high doses and seems to love it, so I'm wondering if maybe the people who seem unimpressed by this simply did not take a high enough dose?


Does that seem like a dangerous dose range?

I took around 100 milligrams last week and was just starting to get visuals. It seems pretty boring on its own. I really like it mixed with 4-Aco-DMT though.

I'd like to try it at >100mg but even 50mg makes me feel pretty nauseous a couple of hours in, I've tried taking on empty stomach, full stomach etc. I guess this stuff just isn't for me which is shame as it's quite nice.

Every single time I have amazing experiences on this drug. 130mg is a good strong trip for me. I have a friend who does 120mg spaced over 4-5 hours and says he finds it mediocre, I suggest not spacing these things out - do them all in one go.


On a lower dose of ~70mg I found the nausea almost unbearable but the higher doses are a lot more stable for me.


Tricks for lowering any ill feeling:

 - **Do not smoke or drink this shit**. Bomb it in a rizzla or IM or something. Avoid your smell and taste senses at **ALL COST!**

 - Turning heaters off or staying away from them for a while, especially fan heaters that will blow waves of air at you. You need some consistent temperature.

 - Don't eat right before and don't NOT eat. Perfect timing for me is around 2-3 hours prior.

 - Make sure you have a very comfy seat to sit in, or a bed to lay in. (This drug has the "Orgasm Effect", you will be so pumped with adrenaline-type energy but you'll not be able to move. Another analogy is the feeling immediately after a fight. Weak knees but so full of energy.)

 - Have some clean water to drink, don't bother yourself with any juice or alcohol until well in to the trip and the nausea is gone.

 - If you are going to watch a film, or listen to music, try turning it down a little or watching on a darker screen.


Visuals are stronger than 2C-E for me, patterns in everything. I see "rainbow bottle sparkling" like the spirit bottles behind the bar in a club will give out (If that makes sense xD). Duration at 130mg is a good 7 hours -> 1hr come up, 4 hours up, 2 hour down. Give or take a little while. On ~70mg I found the come down was shorter, with maybe an hour less on the main trip too.

Ah some good tips there Jinux, will try 2-3 hours after eating and drinking water instead of carbonated drinks (I drink carbonated drinks as a good belch usually reduces the nausea but they could well be part of the cause of it also)

4-aco-dipt is the worst tasting thing I've ever tasted in my whole life.  It was like concentrated garbage juice and it was a billion times more bitter than anything I can think of.  5-meo-dalt is pretty easy on the nose when insufflated, however, it has a definite mild caustic sensation, making me not want to snort it ever again.  I'll probably just orally dose this one in the future.

^^ Very strange, I suppose maybe some people aren't receptive? ![:?](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/confused.gif)


I strongly advise taking your doses all at the same time though, as opposed to spacing them out.

I agree that around 20-30mg in a rollie cigarette is amazing, it hits you hard and, albeit not explicitly visual, you do get in a really interesting headspace. I am rather curious about how smoking it frequently affects the heart, as around a month ago me and a friend smoked it 4 times in one week and after that I had some bouts of tachycardia.

What the hell did I smoke yesterday? I look at the picture on Erowid and what I had was more of a white, clumpy/chalky powder. I got it from a vendor who has given me good MXE a couple of times. When I first got it, I took a 40 MG capsule, smoked a blunt, stuck my finger in the bag twice to scoop someone (this was a while later), smoked a bowl with it on top of weed, and nothing. I have no idea why. Maybe it was because of the MXE I've been taking.


Then yesterday. That morning I took a good amount of MXE, not enough to make me get into a M-hole, but a good amount. By 3PM I was pretty much off of it, smoked a joint with a friend, then headed over to my other friend's house to try this 5-MeO-DALT stuff once more. Oh lawdy! I smoked a bowl of bud with a pancake of 5-MeO-DALT on it and watched as this stuff kind of melted. I then did the same thing again, except I just used the resin from the last bowl pack. This stuff melts on top of the weed and makes it so it can't turn into ash... it's weird. Anyway, that's when it started. I felt like I just smoked salvia. My stomach didn't feel so good either and I had urges to throw up, but never did. When I moved around it felt so fucking weird. I felt like I was tripping hard, HARD. I barely was able to go outside to go take a piss. I tried calming myself down after being in the fresh air, but shortly after my legs started to shake and I couldn't hold myself for too long. I went back inside and just laid down thinking that would save me. NOPE. It barely helped, I was laying down on a pillow and covered in a blanket and started furiously shaking. I calmed myself down but I still felt slanted on the ground. Just uncomfortable. The only way I could explain it to my friends was saying that I was just way to high. When it started to come down a bit, I noticed I could feel my heartbeat when I touched my throat. Just weird. I slowly started to come down and felt a lot better. My friends said I was on the floor for about an hour or two, and at one point I remember myself offering them tea.


Can ANYONE tell me what the fuck this was? A lot of it sounds like 5-MeO-DALT, but it seems like I really took it to the next level. Either that or the vendor gave me some shit to fuck with me.

Hmm. Smoking DALT usually only lasts a couple of minutes.

Maybe you packed the bowl with your MXE?

Very bizarre. Didn't take any orally before smoking it?

I'd have to lean towards it not being DALT at all.

Nope. I took maybe around 150 MG of it orally a couple days before last night and it did nothing for me. Maybe a tiny bit of euphoria, but that's it.


It was different from the picture on Erowid. Maybe the vendor sent me this on accident? It's white and has a chalky feeling to it.

I can't remember the consistency, as it's been years.

But I do believe it was fairly powdery. Could be an accident, could be that he doesn't even know what he has..

everyone is confused with this stuff, but I have to say, it is pretty damn good. 

Tried 40mg + 20mg in caps at a show and raged out really hard on it. Was not really able to focus on the high much but I was energized and euphoric with some interesting head space.


Then I tried 50mg capped and smoked weed at a show and I had an amazing time. I was really euphoric and energetic. The head space on this stuff is great. I felt very confident. I was engulfed in the music and had some interesting CEV's, although at one point it felt like I was having visuals of some sort... really social and friendly.


got to say this stuff is good, especially in a social environment.  fast come up and no shitty come down to speak of. only thing i think it has is it is a little rough on the stomach. whatever. defiantly would take again.

Please stop. Like altogether. You are just being destructive as shit. 5-meo-dalt always felt pretty straining on the come up. Your adding in substances that dont even mix.

My 5-MeO-DALT doesn't smell or taste of anything. It has almost a cotton-like consistency, brilliant white. It's not bunk either, definitely does the job, but it's odd how everyone seems to be complaining of the vile taste. Can batches really differ that much?

I tried this for the first time at the weekend and it was an awful experience.  It was after a session that contained 4x 100mg 5-IT, 750mg (in total) Mephedrone and 2x 50mg aMT between Saturday night and Monday afternoon.  It tried 25mg in a gel cap and about half an hour after ingestion everything started flashing and I had to lie down.  That kept on getting more intense for an amount of time I can't accurately gauge until I blacked out and awoke some hours later feeling fine.


Admittedly the heavy combo use in the previous couple of days may have been what caused this to happen but I'll be very wary of trying it again. (Although undoubtedly I will, but from sober this time)

That sounds likely to be related to that combo. That's a ton of serotonergics in such a short period of time. Just for reference, the 5-IT in particular I wouldn't go so overboard with it, it bears some resemblance to 5-APB/6-APB, which in turn are related to the MDxx family, is likely to work in a similar fashion on the brain, and as such, redosing, or using it more often than once a month, will likely lead to lower levels of serotonin transporters in the brain, as seen with heavy MDMA use. Be careful man.


That said - did you do an allergy test at ~1mg prior to this dose? If not, you should really get into the habit of that - it's not uncommon for vendors to mislabel chemicals, and you could easily get sent something 10x the potency of what you're hoping to consume. Plus, although rare, it's possible you can be allergic/extra sensitive to something, which could lead to at the very least an unpleasant experience, at the very worst, something much more serious - if you consume a regular dose.


If I were you, since you had such a severe reaction at 25mg, I'd try work your way up, 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg etc until you find a sweet spot. There's a good chance it's just the hefty combo that ruined it for you, but there's no sense diving back in at the same dose and risking the same happening again.

I just got 5grams of 5-Meo-DALT of 99.8% purity, it is n HCL form..  Does anyone know the vaporization point of this chemical, please? I'd really appreciate it. I am a research chemist and I'd like to collaboratively RESEARCH 5-meo-DALT with anyone else of knowledge of this particular tryptamine.

It looks like it was the combo as I tried 25mg again with nothing else in my system and it was fine.  The come up was a little rough for half an hour but then I enjoyed it and had a pleasant few hours.


I did do an allergy test prior to taking the first dose.

Done a fair bit of reading about this chemical and I'm intrigued. I've got 500mg on the way to test. I plan to start with a dose of 40mg, see where that takes me. Hopefully I will be taking it this Friday in the company of my girlfriend.

First time with 5-MeO-DALT this evening and couldn't be more disappointed with it. Completely underwhelmed. Source is absolutely reliable, supplied as pure white, opaque, tiny needle-like crystals, almost fibrous when clumped together, kinda like fibreglass maybe. Doesn't wanna chop into lines at all but easily insufflated as a big ball of fluff. Dissolved pretty readily in Lucozade far as I could see. I'm as sure as I can be then that what I've got here is exactly what it says on the tin


Decided I'd be cautious with it insufflating 30-40mg tops and gave it a good hour 'n' half before even thinking of redosing, then same amount again oral to see if that made a difference, chased 5-10mg off foil over a couple of hours, redosed again. Somewhere around 150mg total then over a 3 hour period which Erowid tells me is an insane dose and all there is to show for it is a warmer tinge to colour, bit of soft focus going on, almost imperceptible patterns overlaying themselves on surfaces but no OEVs / CEVs whatsoever beyond that. Music is definitely improved but it's subtle. Nowhere near as much as you'd get with shrooms / LSD / aMT. I've got a bit of a mood lift out of it and quite chilled out but that's it. Chasing it gives an immediate buzzy hit within seconds that's kinda rushy and perfectly nice but no more than that. It's teasing with the promise that something's starting to kick in without ever quite delivering. I could not call this a psychedelic on tonight's performance. No mental effects whatsover as far as I can tell, with none of the introspection, novel thinking or insightfulness I would expect of a true psychedelic. Disappointing.


Oh, and Alyxuk, good to see one more of the Leeds contingent swelling the Bluelight ranks BTW. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

You guys are not getting 5-meo-dalt from the sounds.  I know 70mgs for ME would be way Overwhelming. It takes about 20 minutes to start effects. Then at the 30minute mark it should feel a litttlllee like a mdxx type music appreciation..relaxtion as well. After that it gets confusing imho very very confusing for 20minutes after then you get mild but Very apparant psychedelic effects. Colors,textures all vibrantish. It lasts about 2hours total. It makes you eat to. I dunno. Im kinda glad I got what I did when I did the appearance of some of these descriptions of the chemical just sounds odd as well as the effects. Id contact whomever purchased from if unreactive.

Yea that sucks. Honestly I wont be taking it for awhile its a novelty and A Nice one at that but the confusion got a litttlleee overwhelming the last time I did it. I and a Mate took roughly 25mgs each. We both agreed we were very confused like drunk in a way for about 15-20minutes and it was only after I said lets hit the bowl. Which btw I want to say again--Weed Reaaallyyy Synergizes with this and brings out some very cool visuals as well as a better experience. I had got my meodalt a year ago? So I have no idea about what everyones getting now. I dont recall ever needing more than 35mgs. I did take it once with a mate as well and we underdosed ate too much and got nothing out of it both dosing 15mgs though. Its a rather unique substance. Try looking for another source. I promise once you get the real stuff you will get that short duration. Have some weed on you as well. I find if you hit the dank about 20 minutes Into ingestion you get more pronounced effects. Its possible you may just need to try again in a week same batch 30mgs and hit the bong Harrrdddd after 20 minutes. You kinda get a tingly effect while you blow out the smoke and while you inhale it feels like your toking on speed--like you cold just take a huuuge hit by accident lol. Idk. I am pretty experienced with this one but not like Everyday/month/week use...I have used it on 6-5 occasions. The first was the funnest and made me feel doope. Taking it at 8pm and getting to bed at Midnight is awesome lol.

I've never heard of 5-meo-dalt smelling like pain stripper so it was probably a good idea to chuck it. Mine doesn't smell much but the taste is disgusting, 40mg in a glass of water (didn't realize it was the freebase so it didn't even dissolve) was horrible to drink, made me gag.

I would consider that but seeing as how the meodalt I obtained replicated pretty much Every effect that its been said to and the duration comedown time was very accurate I dont see it. Theres a hcl kinda and a freebase dalt maybe some of you are eating it on a Full stomach? I really dont know. I know what I have tried is mos Def meodalt. I do know some people have a high tolerance to things. I saw someone eat up to 70mgs and nothing. Then they got up and heard all sorts of funky shit outside.....some of you I dunno but OI havent seen any meodalt around in awhile

I tried ~25 mg of 5-MeO-DaLT and was surprised at the quick buildup in intensity. Enough so that I didn't dose higher (had 75 mg in apple juice). After 10ish minutes I was really rushing and I kept on rushing for a little bit and then it pretty much stopped so I don't really know what happened. I'll try it again but I'm gonna cap it this time, even in apple juice it tastes like shit (75 mg/ 12 oz juice).

what do you mean it just..stopped? Your reporting what I call the confused part of meodalt but after that it just feels very mellow ... im telling you  WEEDD ..  get some hit it and watch tv if your not getting anything noticeable Id stop using that batch. The buildup or rush is fast but it usually takes 20 mins for me. After the confusion wears off you should be left with a buzzy shrrom like glow and small visuals ranging in effect of intensity depending on how much was taken...30mgs is the spot...

After the confusing part I just wasn't feeling much of anything, I could tell I had just tripped but wouldn't say I was anymore. It was very odd. If I had some weed I would have smoked it but I didn't have any on me.

Ok it sounds like you dont understand how SUBTLE it turns after the confusion. Again this chemical is useless without weed. Imo but some of these experiences sound odd. Its a tricky chemical but when you get it youll get it...did you Watch a movie...cheesy b horror movies are best on this chemical

I guess I don't understand how subtle it is but you wrote that their were "then you get mild but Very apparant psychedelic effects. Colors,textures all vibrantish" which makes it seem like I would notice more, weed or no weed. I know my batch is good (comes from a very reputable supplier who will hand out NMRs if I ask), I was just surprised at the effects. And I doubt I'm going to sit and watch a cheesy movie or TV on any psych, maybe a trippy movie but preferably I would just hang out with friends or go for a walk as I did with the 5-MeO-DaLT. 


I'm going to try vaporizing some soon and will report back on that.

Vaped a bit last night, not too much, just enough to get a decent rushing sensation. It tastes awful so I'm gonna try to infuse on some spearmint.

Lol it is fairly cheap and unless you have used a trypt or psychedelics before the meodalt I think 120mgs would fucking Rock someone but I have read odd reports and have had and seen different reactions. If it cant be felt through smoking id say its badly made or cut to shit but I dunno. Its not anything amazing but its really fun for an evening inside with movies and pot.

Smoked some weed and felt it a tiny bit more I think, but it could well have been psychosomatic. The dosages I've tried have gone so far in excess of the Shulgin data that I can't believe that it's the same chemical, or else it's cut to hell and back. I'm going to flush the rest of what I have and maybe order some more from somewhere else.

Yeah that sounds way too high. Though - did you take any other drugs recently? Are you on any medication? I'd bear these factors in mind before immediately jumping to the conclusion that you have a bad batch, though I suspect that may be the case.

Times way off for your trip dude. But you did put it in a gelcap. It always hits hard after about 45 minutes and Thats when confusion starts. This confusion would be VERY difficult to sleep on. Its like a overwhelming shroom come up while being drunk. There are oevs but its more subtle and relaxing. Dont dose that high again. Weed needs to be smoked like 30mins after consumed and consumes it on an EMPTY STOMACH . On an empty stomach it takes no longer than 30 to start feeling confused as fuck.

What's all this about confusion? I've never been confused on 5-MeO-DALT at all. Sometimes on the come-up I'll wonder if it's hitting me (until it does obviously xD) but I get those thoughts with every trip.

IMO i think 5-meo-dalt gets a bad rep because of its lack of visuals compared to other tryptamines, but i think its a unique one in that vaped it gives the tryptamine rush with complete psychedelic mindspace and self analytical aspects, while not blowing you off the the planet, although vaped at cerian doses it can be very intense, and oral is impressive as its a great alternative ti amp or any other phenyethlyamine stim, I like tryptamines in general so i might be a bit bias, but the rush is similar to DMT but lacks the visuals its just the typtamne high/euphoria, wich could be incredible during peaks of other psychedelics, there is one in the works ( 5-meo-malt) wich is supposedly active @ 1.8mg so there is alot to be done, not as visualt but definitly another unique tryptamine thats great in its own respects, dont go into it thinking 4-ho-dmt or 5-meo-mipt

I snorted 5-Meo-Dalt 3 times.


First time, I did a 30mg line + a 50 mgs line 1 hour later,

Second time was 80mg. Was uncomfortable for a few minutes around the 1h mark, and then had a nice trip.

3rd time: 110mg. Puked a lot with heavy sweating.


There's a potential to develop a bad habit (addiction) with this one because of the low duration, and no bad effects on the next day with low doses. I moved to low-dose 4-Aco-DMT, much more interesting in my opinion.

This sounds incredible. Pity am working all this week or else I'd try it one evening. 500mg arrived in the post today though. When I get a chance I'm only going to start with a 15mg-20mg dose.

I was hyperactive. I was moving constantly, walking, going, and going back. My mind was running at 100 miles per hour, someone not used to trip might have lost it. 


Also, there was a strong sexual energy going with the trip.


It wasn't bad for snorting, no worse than E pills for example. It was in the HCL form.

The only thing I really like about 5-MeO-Dalt is the rush when vaped. It's quite intense, but lasts only for some 5-10 minutes. After that there's just a very strange feeling, a bit like being stoned mixed with a 5-MeO tryptamine bodyload, without much visual activity other than a slight glow everywhere I look. When snorted it's just the weird feeling of being intoxicated but not really tripping. This is the only psychedelic I can be and have been in the company of relatives with.

I guess it's the Freebase vs. HCl Salt, that makes the a huge difference. I have been doing 20 and 30mg in Gelcaps and insufflated a bit and never felt anything. I even had ca. 40mg with Harmaline, nada. Only after I mixed some with Ascorbic Acid, it got very bitter, and a few minutes after ingestion I got pretty visuals. (My current batch is the freebase, long, glittering needles, that look like cotton.)

I got some of this the other day,i was walking past a twisted Japanese tree that held out it`s branch and gave me a free sample,nice little Japanese tree.


What i have is the very white fluffy cotton wool type,i vaped 30mg,i had a quite intense rush and was in a altered odd head space for a few minutes,everything took on that tryptamine glow but it was very short lived and not very interesting at all...A very odd chemical indeed,probably better taken with other chemicals like 2c-d is.

I see no reason for vaporising 5-Meo-DALT, since it works well when taken orally, with some Acorbic or Citric acid. But I will definitely repeat the Harmaline combination, now I know my stuff is active and reliable.

@latest: I did a dose of 25mg with a spash of lemon juice yesterday, right after the posting, and it was clearly active. I had no visuals, only a body rush similar to the onset of other psychedelics, but much stronger, very euphoric. I had taken 10mg of Medazepam about half an hour before, maybe that's why I got no visuals. Gonna keep testing. ;-)


It's clear to me, that the gastric acid should have been strong enough to make the 5-Meo-DALT soluble even when consumed as freebase, but so far I had 3 negatives when swallowing it in vegan gelcaps, and 2 positives when dissolving and drinking it.

How does this stuff compare to ecstacy? If they are similar in any way, does the unique effects of ecstacy come at least half way close to it?

I feel really tired. Is this normal? I can feel that mild triptamine buzz in the background, like mild tingles in my skin, feeling hot and my muscles feel quite stiff. No visuals. Next time I think I'll dose 25mg.


Well, 15mg oral is barely even active. I'm glad I dosed low anyway, now I can work my way up, next time 25 - 30mg for me.

Plugging is effective,30mg up the poop shoot and i was immersed for at least over an hour in a really good space,uplifting like MDMA with a very clean high,i noticed i was salivating a lot like when on LSD but the feeling was just suberb and the after glow still persists the next day.


30mg was dissolved in citric acid and water.

Hahaha!!


I'm going to dose in between 25-30mg tomorrow. I'm really tempted to try it out again tonight though.

It's hard to get a worthwhile buzz out of for a lot a people, let alone a profound experience. There are rc's on the market designed to approximate the effects of MDMA such as 6-APB. I've not tried it, but there's a big & dandy thread on it you could check out.

Thanks for the reply. Sad to hear about that as I had read people comparing the effects to a mild MDMA buzz.


I've actually tried 6-APB, but that was while on an antipsychotic which cancelled all of the psychedelic aspects of it. I've quit abilify now so there's a high chance I will retry it after a week or so.

If I took a 30mg dose, what kind of psychedelic effects am I expected to get? I understand that 5-Meo-DALT isn't very visual, but what kind of visuals are we talking? Morphing walls ect..?


Or 30 - 35mg?


I just bombed 32mg, I'll be back later to report my trip, my bluelight buddies ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for posting this, I've never bothered plugging it as I hadn't seen any reports on it so I'd assumed it would be similar to smoking it (i.e a short lasting hit). After seeing this I'll probably give it a go next week, sounds really good :D

20:05 - Just bombed 32mg of 5-meo-DALT. I have also drank half a bottle of wine over the past half an hour.


20:25 - No effects yet. 


20:30 -  Feeling something mild, time seems to have gone slower, objects seem slightly brighter, and music sounds a bit clearer.


20:40 - Can feel some slight neck tension. (Shit I've now forgot what else I was going to say....) Oh yeah, music is definitely becoming much more pleasant to listen to. I just got my first chill in my body.


20:50 - Objects have a sparkle to their surfaces, like a glistening beam reflected off a mirror. My glass of wine looks tasty. I take a sip. I watch my hands while typing this report, the hands look spectacular, they're definitely mine but rather pretty. 


20:55 - Still not much psychedelia going on. I'm just noticing things that I wouldn't have done while sober. Titanic is on TV and the violins sound very nice, as the ship is about to sink. My sense of Touch has definitely increased. I can hear EVERYTHING, it's fantastic how little sounds appear while on 5-meo-DALT. My body feels very clean, no body load whatsoever. (Maybe because I've drank 3/4 bottle of wine.)


21:05 - Chills go through my body still, its quite pleasant. Still hardly any psychedelic feelings. My skin starts to tingle a little more, like a pepper mint is circulating through my veins. 


21:15 - Feeling pretty tired, like stoned and a bit unsociable. I'll report back in half an hour. (no change in pupil size)


21:45 - It's ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT WHILE SMOKING A UR-144 BLEND!!!!!!!! WAAAAAAA!!!!!

The comedown was like a very mild aMT one. Feeling a little cold and stiff. I got to sleep around 2am, after two 7.5mg zopiclone tablets and 4mg etizolam (over the apace of an hour). I probably wouldn't have slept until 4am if I had no downers.


Probably a very bad idea but I have a feeling this would have a lovely synergy with MXE. 


I'm gonna give snorting a go next time. Is it painful and taste horrible when snorted? I have the cotton wool looking batch, pure white in colour.

> I had an extremely intense experience vaping this on top of weed last night. 50mg sandwiched between layers of pretty weak weed got me to a terrifying place.

No hallucinations, just this familiar sight made utterly strange, like seeing something on an alien planet. I said out loud "now that is fucking incredible. I'm really glad I saw that." But that was a very brief respite from the terror. My heart was pounding like a jack hammer, there was strange music and nonsense phrases playing in my head. I felt like I'd gone completely insane and it took every shred of willpower I have to keep myself together.

50mg smoked is an insane amount!!  I've only done 30mg orally so far, but I think I'll up the dose next time, maybe 40mg. If you're smoking it you shouldn't really have more than 20mg.

Ok, well ive just had my first experience with this one ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Its actually rather nice!

ROA: I stuck around 20 mg in a rollie (I have the freebase)

Smoked fine, not harsh at all. Just tasted like a normal smoke to me.

Onset was fast, infact as soon as I finished I felt effects.

I felt the sudden urge to lie down almost as if ive just smoked a strong indica, so I did. 

I looked up, the sky looked BEA-utiful! Its a glorious day over where I am, and I spent a good 10 minutes just looking at the clouds and watching the birds. 

Visually wise, it was not strong however. Only notable effect was there seemed to be little sparkles like the ones you get in arts and crafts falling from the sky. 

I closed my eyes, This was quite strange there was no real visualisations just colors, first bright red, then green, then grey. 

My thoughts also seemed much clearer, with a louder internal monologue. 

I dosed at around 3.15 pm, its now 3.40 and I am pretty much sober, Music maybe sounds slightly better but it is difficult to tell really. 

Overall pretty fun, and I love the short duration. 

Only warning I have is it seems slightly fiendish with this ROA: I have had to fight the urge to roll another. 

I had no side effects, I am also defiantly in a better mood than I was before dosing (however isnt this true for all psycadelics! ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) )

This is probably the easiest chemical I've ever snorted, no taste, no sting. Nothing ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Wow, 30mg snorted is pretty trippy. I was not expecting this! XD

I have to agree with you ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It produces such a lovely headspace, but yet feels so gentle and forgiving at the same time. Honestly i've smoked weed for the past 4 years and this is beginning to make me wonder why! I dont know why people seem to see it as a MDMA alternative, but I could defiantly see it as a cannabis alternative especially as there is no "stone over" or foggy after effects, with this one it seems once its gone, its gone pretty much ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 


Since my last post I have tried 35mg smoked, there was not much difference in intensity if im honest. Sparkles where still present, as was the lovely head space and once again I spent it watching the birds and the clouds ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Birds seem incredible for me on this substance for some reason, so majestic and graceful I could watch them for hours. 

However I did notice a definite increase in heart rate and some slight neck tension with this dose. My thoughts where also moving alot faster and lacked the clarity the earlier dose provided. Closed eye however was really quite pleasant, I was walking through a wood ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

But yeah overall I feel 20mg seems to be the "sweet spot" for me atleast.

Im looking forward to trying other ROAs tommorrow, glad to here such a positive report for insufflation will probably be the way I will go. 

My only gripe is the lack of a real visual aspect. Was this the same when snorted? Also would smoking a spliff perhaps help this like it does with MDMA?

^^ I snorted 30mg, it took about 10-15 minutes to come on, it was like the beginning of an aMT trip (only visually, without the dirty stimulation) but it never came. It was very relaxing too, I also noticed quite a lot of empathy. Food tastes very nice too. The best part lasted about one hour then after that gradually fading away, all together lasting no more than 2 1/2 hours. It was a very, very friendly experience. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I also feel in a really good mood 24 hours later, less anxiety and quite motivated in my job.

I took ~25mg orally at a festival combo'd with ~15mg of 5-MeO-MiPT a couple weeks ago and didn't really feel a whole lot from the 5-MeO-DALT. Maybe a little stoning effect but nothing major. The moxy was great when it kicked in but it almost seemed like placebo with 5-MeO-DALT. I'll give it another run on its own but at a higher dose orally when I have another opportunity.

Ok people. Well I finished my DALT today, and I went LARGE! I dissolved my remaining 200mg in some lemon juice and downed it. 

This really was an interesting experience, I took it at exactly 3pm. It is now about 10 to 6 and the effects seem to have faded alot (I would be fine to drive). So about 3  hours in duration for me.

Ok well onset was FAST for me, within minutes colours where distorted and tracers where apparent. It felt alot like MDMA, good MDMA. Everything also had a warm glow. Infact the onset was so rapid I vomited. This happens to me on several psychs though. 

Ok well this is where it got really interesting, It felt like being stoned almost body load wise, very lazy. I felt I should close my eyes so I did and OH MY GOD! CEV's where absolutely insane. Flashing patterns, swirls, Bears, Wolves, Cars. All made an appearance. Also clarity of thought like ive never experienced before and self analysis. I could prioritize everything and just let go of everything that didn't matter so well it was incredible (Ive had a really stressful week). I really feel ive learnt alot from this trip unlike my other experiences with the drug. I spent the majority of my trip with my eyes closed actually. But when opened visuals where defiantly present. everything appeared to be breathing almost and morphing and all kinds of weird stuff the sparkles where also present of course ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) 

In terms of negatives I didnt experience any really, I got abit cold at one point which was unusual as its a scorching hot day here, but that was about it really. Just beware though, this was VERY VERY INTENSE! Or to put it in laymans terms i was trippin my nuts off ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 

Im sorry if this report is abit breif and scattered! Im still trying to put into words what i just experienced! I will try and add more latter.


Also as I side note, I am now currently in the best mood of my life I swear! Its so hard to explain, I just feel literally so alive and happy to be its unreal! :D :D :D

No probs ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I find snorting is the best way to go with this chemical, I might go and sniff 30mg and sit in the garden with a few beers and headphones. That would be heaven!! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thread cleaned up a little. Please don't make multiple posts in a row guys. It clutters up the thread, try to fit your information into one post ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Also Michael, it's worth clarifying the DALT to 5-MeO-DALT, since DALT is another existing psychedelic and someone searching for posts regarding it might take your post as an example.

I disagree. It's short lived and pointless. Whereas it's actually an experience if you take a high dose of it orally.

I find this happens on most psychedelics. Eating food seems to bring on visuals with spectacular force.

I always thought it had something to do with the jaw massaging and relaxing the eye area.

I also thought this was something that only I ever noticed.

I liked this chem before but only used small amounts smoked in a rollup. But did not like it at all orally (but I was blind drunk when I did this which would explain why) anyway I put what I put in an uknown amount, but probably in the region of 40-60mg at a guess in my pipe last night and was absolutely blown away. I was smoking smaller amounts all night whilst on 10mg 3-meo-pcp via IM and that was rather nice but the 3-meo-pcp was already doing a very good job on it's own. But once the 3-meo-pcp wore off and I hit that big pipe, wowee. I was literally rolling around having a full blown body orgasm. I actually couldn't help but like, make this moan noise every few minutes in sheer bliss. CEV's were spectacular. Oh and this was the grand finale to a 4 day affair on M&M/6&5apb. Epic!

Maybe its because the like for food naturally increases our serotonin levels causing more psychedelia. I find snorting is the best way imo. It takes about 30 minutes to come on and lasts for about 2 1/2 hours

I believe, as lynx said, it has more to do with a sudden change in neurochemistry. It may be the glycaemic load of food causing a sudden stimulatory shift in brain activity, which would account for the fast onset of sensorial distortions and headspace change after eating (whereas serotonin synthesis would take a bit longer). And then any added stimulants such as theobromide in chocolate, and neurochemical precursors in the food, would add their effect slightly later.


It could also be tied to the immediate stimulation of the gut, where there are a lot of serotonin receptors. As soon as we eat, there are immediate hormonal changes taking place in order to direct bodily attention in to digesting the food. These hormonal/neurochemical changes are undoubtedly amplified in the psychedelic headspace.

From a PERCEPTION point of view, some of its characteristics are indistinguishable from cannabinoid activation (which of course, given the structure of the chemical, won't be the case), lots of people (myself included) reporting a very heavy "stoned" effect -- so I'm really interested to see what's actually going on.

Hey all


Ive got 1g of 5-meo-dalt sat here and waiting for my scales to arrive ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Been reading an awful lot on this substance over the last few weeks and tying to make some decisions.  I read a few pages back that it would be wise to do a 1mg allergy test.  If this was done how long should I then take before I take an additional dose? I will add that I am 100% new to the world of psychedelics of any type.  In the past I have taken lots of things like stims and smokes but have actively avoided psychedelics.  I am going to start with a low dose I am thinking 5mg and am thinking to snort it.  The reason for snorting is I cant be bothered with the twisted guts I remember from taking stims in the past.  Smokings sound like it could be a bit full on and too over bearing for a first psychedelic experience.  It might also help to say what I am looking for ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I am looking for the euphoria that has been reported with this substance but without too much psychedelia.  I want to know where I am what I am doing etc, I dont want to be off this planet.  What are the side effects from this when snorted? i.e. rapid heart? gastro problems? Do you get that horrible penis shrinking thing?  anything else?  My setting will be sat at home on an average eveing watching the TV and possibly playing some Xbox 360 later on, if possible lol.  My wife will be present and not taking anything in order to keep an eye on me.


One other important thing to note is I also take Levitra for errm those reasons which could still be in my system I guess.  Is this safe? I note Levitra affects the dilation of blood cells and as 5-meo-dalt can effect heart rate etc I wonder if there is a possible adverse side effect between the two? I also note that with Levitra I am a user that notices an onset or coming up as it were, a kind of honry feeling.  5-meo-dalt has also in the past been reported to have a aphrodisiac effect! Not sure I want to end up rageingly horny if the two combine.


Hints and advice welcomed please.  Hope to be ready to try this Saturday and will do reports as long as my scales arrive :D

Mixed 5meodalt with 2cb and 2cc recently


25mg 5meodalt with 25mg 2cc - Very nice combo. I ate 2cc then 5meodalt 30 minutes later. Visuals were fairly strong and quite enjoyable at t+1:45. Made me laugh a lot. Will take again at 40mg each next time but eat them together, this summer maybe?


28mg 5meodalt with 8-9mg 2cb - A combo I do not plan to take again, the body buzz was too strong for me, even at these low doses. Didn't get visuals really except up-close to the tiles in the bathroom while taking a piss. Perhaps in a different setting the buzz would have been enjoyable. 25mg of both would be very visual I bet.

Returning from a short break from Bluelight. Been lurking just without much time to post. 


Anyway, will be giving this a run out over the weekend. Have tried a couple of allergy tests this week in the single digit mg range. All seemed ok. The plan is to drop 30mg (orally). After reading through part two of the mega-thread and all thirty-one sides of the first, it appears there is very little consensus on the effects of this substance. Moreover, there seems to be little consensus as to the most effective method of administration.


As I've said on here before, such conclusions are telling and the use of most substances is extremely subjective - read through the 5 and 6 APB threads for additional evidence of this phenomena. However, I'm grateful for all the posts on here. The subjective weight of evidence is all we have with new (and old) RCs. I'll take care with this stuff and report back.


Alternatively, I might just eat some acid ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've found it extremely hard to find a workable dosage for this stuff. Orally I got nothing until I worked up to 120mg and then it hit me way too hard. With smoking I got very little until I took a fucking mega hit and got catapulted into a kind of hellish tryptamine breakthrough experience, like an ultra-dysphoric DMT trip.


If I decide to try it again, I will dissolve the freebase in lemon juice, as this is reported to help with oral dosing by more than one poster.

I've had 3 trips a few years ago. 


The first trip I had with 5-meo-dalt was about 30mg. I noticed the first effects 30min after ingesting. After another half hour I was peaking.

The peak effects were breathing walls and beeing very stoned. 


The second time I took 40mg and the effects were pretty much the same.


The third time though was not really fun. I took 50mg on an empty stomache and after 40min I just had to lay down because of the overwhelming depressing feelings. It kind of was like when you are really drunk and smoke a joint or a bowl. I rode this out and after an hour I was at baseline. 


I never touched this stuff since then. It's just too shortliving to enjoy properly and the last trip has turned me away from 5-meo-dalt.

This was seriously funky stuff.


Dropped 30mg. Come up within an hour. Body load and come up were possibly the most unpleasant I've ever experienced. Very intense. Never seemed to level out. Straight up and then straight down. The tripping qualities of the drug were present yet I couldn't access them. When I closed my eyes, I could feel CEVs were there yet I couldn't see them. Gentle hints at OEVs. Possibly some mild wall-warping etc. Very glad it was a short lived experience. 


Seemed to cause some degree of chest pain and made breathing a little difficult. I'm suffering from hay-fever and asthma so that may have been the factor. 


Certainly worth trying but not quite what I was looking for.

I've seen reports of people insufflating this and it seems to be a good RoA to try. Has anyone tried insufflating the freebase? I fancy giving it a go tonight but don't want to rack up a line just to find it burns like hell and is hardly active ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Insufflation is definitely the way to go, I find. The onset from vaping is too fast and I'd imagine oral dosing will increase any nausea the drug may cause. Insufflation (small doses) induces a nice buzz of stimulation that's subtle but very much appreciated.

Do tolerance build fast on this?


I took 50mg oral some days ago and had a blast. Then I tried it again with 50mg 10 hours ago, but nothing close to it happen.

I've tried this compound once and I thought I'd add my experience with it.


I did 26 mg oral dissolved in hot tea on a pretty empty stomach. After the tea had cooled down I drank it, and it tasted pretty horrible. Similar to MXE, but much stronger, and the tea did not manage to conceal the taste at all. The taste stuck in my mouth, though it did lessen after I used a little NaHCO3. After about 15 - 20 minutes I felt a bit of tingling, and after maybe 30 - 40 minutes I'd reached the plateau. Music sounded a bit nicer than usual, and I had some body high, but it felt pretty uncomfortable. Sort of like how you feel right before an orgasm; it is a nice feeling, but still you just want to "get there". This feeling persisted the entire time I was at the plateau keeping me from enjoying it fully. After I had listened to an album I started feeling rather horny. Around the 1.30 hour mark the tension left me quite suddenly, and it felt almost like letting out a deep breath. After that I felt calm and relaxed, and the effects very noticeably diminishing. I didn't notice much psychedelia. 


I thought the tension might have been caused by underdosing, so I tried redosing with 66 mg around the 2.10 hour mark. I felt the come-up pretty strongly after 20 minutes, but was still able to communicate when someone called me without much difficulty. In fact I felt talking was rather easy, and I mentally kept myself back from being too warm and friendly (something I'm normally not on the phone). When I hit the plateau I once again got the intense kinda pleasurable feeling in the body, but much stronger than before. However the "not quite getting there" feeling was equally stronger, and kept me feeling tense and keeping me from really enjoying it. I listened to music and found it to be very nice. I was lying on the sofa, and kept stretching my muscles. I didn't notice any changes in my vision with my eyes open, but with my eyes closed I was seeing out-of-focus shapes and patterns moving somewhat in tune with the music. They were quite faint, though, and in my journal I noted that I couldn't quite tell if they were "CEVs or thoughts". With my eyes closed I also noticed that dimensions were affected, and it felt like my body was morphing (growing longer, going up, twisting sideways a bit, etc.). These feelings disappeared entirely when I opened my eyes. I also generally felt like I was in a psychedelic head space, without being able to pin down exactly how or why. I felt horny once again, and I have a feeling sex would have been quite enjoyable. Again the tension and the pleasant/unpleasant body high left me around 1.30 hours after redosing. I got quite hungry and ate some sweet and sour chicken thing, which tasted good but somewhat different than usual. During this entire time I had a strange feeling of having to keep doing what I was doing until it was done, so when I was reading a thread on a forum I wanted to keep reading and keep reading (even though I wanted to do something else), and when I was listening to music I wanted to listen to the entire album, etc. Since it was pretty outside I decided to go for a walk. My sense of colours seemed somewhat muted during this walk, but my sense of smell seemed more vivid and I noticed (good) smells I normally don't when I walk here. The sunshine was however uncomfortably hot on my skin.  I felt a bit weak too, and so I didn't walk too far. When I got back I sat down in front of the computer. I thought the effects had pretty much left me, but then I noticed that I was periodically hearing parts of the songs I'd listened to before I went on the walk. Within 3 - 4 hours of redosing I felt completely back to normal again, and didn't feel any after effects. That is I felt completely normal, like nothing had happened at all.  I did however wake up with a migraine the next day, but this might have been due to caffeine withdrawal or something else. 


I will definitively try this compound again, but I'll probably bomb it as I don't think I could stand that taste one more time. Also, I don't think redosing is a very good idea.

^Thanks for the above. Most of what you wrote struck a chord with my experience. I didn't seem to arrive at a settled place. The whole 'trip' seemed constantly out of my grasp. I did bomb only 30mg but I just don't fancy going higher.

I'd compare it with 2C-B. It gives you a buzz that's pretty 'in your face' so to speak. Similar 'underwater' type visuals on walls but different mindset I'd say.

Yeah it vapes really well in my experience. I always have had the super white fluffy stuff. 25mg would be a fairly strong hit to vape for your first time. I tried using a vape pipe (glass dick) to smoke but I had better results just by either sandwiching between herb or just putting about 12-15mg on-top of some ashes and melting it with the lighter. It melts pretty quick but totally tastes like shit. I'd recommend having something to spit in and water or something to wash your mouth out with. It gives you a way more intense body high that I feel is different than with oral and nasal ROA. The visuals are also waaaay more intense and have a faster too obviously. I took a huge hit one time (not sure the dose, just eye balled) and before I blew the hit out the walls and the clouds on my TV were already warping. At that dose though the body high was unpleasant. If the body high wasn't so strong I would be down for smoking this stuff. 


Up the nose produces a nice gentle stimulation for a bit. Hard to sleep afterwards too. I bumped 40mg in 3 doses every 15-20 minutes or so. No visuals with this ROA but I have only tried it once. The best experience with this drug have been mixed with 2C-C (25mg each) or solo at doses around 65-75mg.

Hello.


I'm no blank palette.


50mg camfetamine plugged

~100mg etaqualone vaped

1 poppy pod extract plugged

A bottle of wine

~10mg MXE snorted

~10mg 3-MeO-PCP snorted


Why so many drugs today? Because I don't feel right, and nothing seems to hit the spot.


Until: 10mg 5-MeO-DALT dissolved in 5ml water with a drop of vinegar squirted up my arse:


YES. The spot has been hit! I feel zingy, zesty, zappy!


I will be focussing more closely on this chemical in future.

I think the word 'edgy' covers it.

Colour enhancement, noticing patterns, but with a lot of adrenaline, couldnt settle, had to keep busy to avoid negative thought loops.


Think of a rollercoaster....the first bit you're slowly climbing, everyone is a bit quiet, its a bit tense, then when you've finished climbing instead of the "WEEEE!!!" fun bit, you just get off feeling a tad disappointed.


Thats what 5meoDalt was like for me, very stimmy. I usually get on well with stims but was relieved when it was over tbh.


However the friend i was with was smiling, stretching having a great time and pestering me for another line.

Tried smoking some 5-MeO-DALT with AM-2201 today. Just eyeballed the doses, made them real small in equal parts. Melted with a lighter's flame and carefully vaped it. Really good mixture! I found it to be a fairly decent weed substitute. Nice mellow body high, they compliment each other nicely. I will try this when I'm tripping for sure. May try with a bit of oral MXE also.


If anyone tries this make sure you start super small. DALT has kicked my ass before accidentally smoking too big of a hit and from what I understand it is easy to do the same with AM-2201.


edit: Please heed my warning! You can seriously overdue it if you smoke too much. The combo can get you reaaaaal fuckin' high (which is upleasant to say the least).

I've been experimenting a bit with this one over the last year.

While I've found it to be hardly noticeable orally, smoking it makes for a nice buzz somewhere between a cannabis high and a mild trip with gentle breathing visuals and a nice headspace.

Not very functional socially, but very nice for total immersion in a movie for example.

And as I've seen others mention, the munchies one can get from 5-MeO-DALT are indeed completely ridiculous ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

My smoked doses have been from 10-30mgs rolled up with tobacco.


However, the only time I've combined it with another psychedelic was at the tail end of a quite mild 2C-D trip, and that blew me away.

Me, my girlfriend and a friend had done ~40 mgs of 2C-D, had a real nice evening with lots of laughs and just talking and having a good time, 

and when the effects started going away I suggested we share a little bit of 5-MeO-DALT to keep the magic going just a little longer.

The others agreed, and I rolled up 25 mgs that the three of us smoked.

Felt very good, just like it brought back the trip a little bit, until 15 minutes later... 

BAM! Melting, morphing, cartoony, rubbery visuals everywhere, and it brought on an unexpected amount of anxiety.


I noticed that my girlfriend looked uneasy too, and when I asked her she just said that something wasn't right.

I got her to describe what was happening, and I understood she had one of those trips where the body sort of disappears and everything dissolves.

I had experienced similar things on previous trips(on other substances) and was able to talk her through it and keep her grounded.


She has a bit of experience in psychedelics, but she hadn't been to that point before.

If we had pushed it to that point on purpose she'd probably not have been that scared of it.


Our other friend seemed to only have a good time though, but he's definitely less sensitive to all substances than us.


So anyway, I just thought I'd share this just so people know that it can really synergise a lot more than you expec with other drugs.

Oh, and another tip; if anyone else gets that horribly dry mouth that won't go away when doing this, a little chocolate is your best friend ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

85mg of this was pretty nice the other night. Comes up nice and gentle and is easy on the ol' noodle. No tremors like high dose phens tend to give me. Only complaint is it's pretty much over right when it gets going. It goes up, then down. I'm sure there are ways to make it peak for an hour at least! =/ Will try at 110-125mg next I imagine.


Bannanas, I find it mixes great with booze.

^Ever since last summer I have noticed when my tolerance is above normal it make my trips a lot shorter. I mean I definitely got visuals and all that and it's not like it went away instantly, it just didn't stay there for very long.

I've experimented a bit more with this compound now. At 75 mg I was finally able to get past the tension I mentioned in my previous post. At this dose I got mild visuals (mostly some dancing coloured dots), and music was enjoyable.

At 110 mg I got a very warm and cosy feeling, and had a lovely time. Playing games was very enjoyable and the visuals were noticeable, but hard to describe. The trip responded very much to music, but it always had a warm overtone and never felt the least bit threatening. Towards the start of the comedown I started wanting food and a cold cucumber from my fridge was absolutely amazing. When I tried to eat a slice of bread, though, I somehow ended up breathing it in. I honestly can't understand how, but it was incredibly uncomfortable and I didn't manage to cough it up properly. So it might be a good idea to be careful. The trip felt a bit dreamlike, and when I closed my eyes I didn't get CEV that I could notice, but I felt almost as though I could still see. It was like I had a sixth sense of how everything around me was. This extended to being able to recall quite vividly faces or places when walking around with my eyes open, and it felt very real. Like the person was there, or like I was in the room I was thinking of. The comedown was very gentle and quite gradual. Though it was a very enjoyable experience, I didn't feel like I was left with anything much of value at the end. A second try at a similar dose gave more or less the same results.

Just watch mixing it with mdxx chemicals. Very very Very straining. Be wise not an idiot people. Alcohol is soso with dalt. Dalts comup is smack in the face but I dont get visuals until the Annoyingly heavy I am moving slow or somethings wrong part is over with. Try to make sense on the comep to someone sober. youll find it hard.

Sorry to intrude thread folks, but I think it'd be a good idea if we avoid calling it 'DALT' , it's 5-MeO-DALT. You wouldn't call psilocin 'DMT', or 5-MeO-DMT 'DMT', would you? It creates needless confusion.

So is this stuff worth it? Read someone post its like a rollercoaster but doesn't reach the full peak. Also, what receptors does this chemical work on? Does it release serotonin? Dopamine?

Just vaped ~20mg of this for the first time. Measured 25mg but lost a little, don't think it could have been more than 5mg though.


A very intense pleasurable euphoric rush that feels similar to something between an MDxx like high and a strong Cannabinoid high, with some light tracers, colour enhancement etc.

The stuff I recieved today is yellowy and kind of like fibres, reminded me of damp fibreglass. I didn't examine in too much and will when i get back but I definitely won't be dosing until I'm sure it's 5-MeO-DALT.

SSRIs will not block the effects of psychedelics but may dull them, depending on the dose. It is very unwise for those suffering from depression to use psychedelics, as a bad trip can have powerful consequences which make things worse.

for me, i have to be off ssri's for a week + for mdma to work properly, but only say 5 days for psych's to work normally at normal doses (tried with 2c-b, 5-meo-dalt, LSD). once i forgot i'd stopped taking my escitalopram and bombed a large amount of 2c-b at a rave. needless to say, i was just toooo fucked, so be careful.


but ssri's don't seem to affect psychedelic's effects as much as the totally take away mdma's magic.

That's because SSRIs block MDMA from binding, but with psychedelics it's mostly just a result of receptor downregulation.

SSRIs cause a higher than normal concentration of serotonin which leads to a kind of tolerance to the effects of serotonin and anything mimicing it (psychedelics).


That make more sense?

Zyprexa isn't an ssri or any other type of anti depressant. It's an anti Psychotic..wondering if anti psychotics would be the same. Like I said I was only taking it for 7 days & I will have stopped taking it for four days when I drop this chemical

Crushed up a bit with the end of a paintbrush on a seethrough tray against black background and now looks very much like the numerous white powders that exist albeit very very clumpy. I think the hair like fibres formed from being forced next to each other for so long in the baggy. Doesn't taste *too* bad but the after taste is rather sickening. Will still be testing it before taking though.

received some today, inside the usual rc baggie, but wrapped in paper.. which i thought was odd..

the powder seems like very fine fibers, and a lot of it clumps together in flakes


very curious to test, took 5-htp earlier will that cause me any harm?

maybe i will just wait till tomorrow..


ease my mind i would like to try it now ![:P](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

well after a small allergy dose, then a 20mg dose can't say much


definitely a change in headspace, like a cannabis cerebral high

definitely noticed i had the tripping laugh and had general unease on come up

had a body load, that i didn't enjoy on my chest


look forward to testing it fully, maybe later today

orally 25mg, can't really comment on anything..


music enhanced a bit, empty headspace


from what i have read vaporizing is best roa, think my MFLB can handle it

my bulb still hasn't been unpacked

if you mean vaporizing no, 

might in a bit as i have two MFLB, this will obviously ruin one further

but i will only try vapor for possible visuals, and better roa as i have read


to me this is a substance for using in conjunction with others,

or for a subtle slight change in conscious 

feels like your a coming up on something and stuck in that in between state


it is interesting but not exactly satisfying anything,

 if what i got is in fact 5-meo-dalt, i have yet to do any reagent test


oh, this gives me the munchies

This totally depends on your individual metabolism and taste. After reading nearly all of the two B&D Threads I still am a little unsure for myself since the doses and preferred ROAs vary so much.


I for example, have not taken psyches in a while and only intend to have a light mellow trip. Thus I won't take more than say 20mg oral after allergy test and slowly titrating up.


But if someone can suggest a more common and/or reliable introduction dose to this substance I would be glad ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm not so sure. While it's not something likely to be something someone would buy with the intention of looking for euphoria, I think having experienced it people might use it that way. I certainly would, as I found the rush from smoking it to be intense and feel great, quite similar to that of 2C-B, albeit unique in its own way.


At the doses I tried with chasing it on foil it was much more of a recreational experience than a deep psychedelic one. Given that the actual information I'd heard of the psychedelic sides of the 5-MeO tryptamines mostly sounded uninteresting to me and I was more intrigued by how many of them had their body highs compared somewhat to MDMA - I was quite pleased with these results.


I'd like to try higher doses next time to explore the confusing/spacey headspace I experienced somewhat though ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tried 30mg orally a few weeks ago while on 20mg Citalopram and I didn't get any effects. I had never taken it orally before, even when not on SSRI's. I always used to snort it and get good effects.

Either it must be cross tolerant with 5 & 6apb or doesn't work good orally as i used 140mg orally after a night of 5&6apb and felt no effect at all. it's the legit stuff too, that clumped together fibreglass wooly looking stuff

hi.

im not a chemist but i dont think tryptamines are cross tolerant with phenethylamine / amphetamine....

could well be wrong.

The issue could be more to do with seratonin levels ?

again just guessing here


main reason for posting here though is to express my 'WTAF?' at your description of legit 5-meo-dalt. 

I hope you trust your source mate as my 5-meo-dalt has never looked anything like that.

Never had it tested but it has always done what you'd expect 5meo-dalt to do.


And yeah, it should work orally. I'm sure you know this stuff affects everyone differently, but i'd expect 140mg oral to be reasonably intense [ unless you'd just had a three course meal ]

Tryptamines can indeed cause cross tolerance and this definitely works orally.

I had some of this lying around for a little while, and after a bit of an all-nighter it looked like an interesting idea.


Unlike my massive tolerance to most drugs, I'm basically a lightweight when it comes to tryptamines. 25mg lines seemed pretty good going for me, of course being me I ended up doing quite a few of them but...


Actually really impressed, had me tripping pretty fucking hard far a little while there, I tried to take a walk into town at one point and got about as far as the next street before realising it was all too much and scurried off back home.


For all my years of stims and dissociative use, I've never really done that many trips or psychedelics in general but I really like this one. Quite short acting which for me is a plus cos I always tend to get bored of long-duration trips, and sniff-able too. Bonus!


Any advice on how to vaporise it? I tried chasing a bit on some foil but it kinda burned real quick. I'm not too hot on smoking/vaping drugs so a simple method would be appreciated.

I don't trust any source neither should anyone else unless you've seen them make the stuff. The description I gave was what a few other people have also described theirs. You can't really chop it into lines it looks like clumps of wool. How do you post pictures on here?

So, I read all two threads and still don't know how to start with this one. Allergy test was done a few days ago but I still want to titrate up slowly since I can't stand harsh comeups and nausea. Does oral dosing provide more of the latter compared to sniffing? Smoking is not an option.


I would appreciate any input on beginner doses and associated ROAs.

It should work on an antipsychotic, depending on which one.

Dixkyate:

Start with 5 mg, then just go up by five if you want to titrate. You'll be fine though, this chemical is more than forgivinh. I always dose orally but make sure to not eat for a while before hand cuz it seems to me that it becomes unnoticeable.

There hasn't been any formal profiling of the pharmacological action, but it should be a serotonin agonist like other tryptamines analogous to 5-meo-dalt. If you're worried about interactions and think you'll be fine with cessation, take 2-3 days off before dosing. Otherwise titrate the dose slowly upwards

I'm not certain about solubility, but it should be soluble. Snorting 5-meo-dalt as been a waste of time ime. I've tried it a few times and never received any significant effects.

Yeah only took anti psychotic for four days. Been off it for three days but the only thing id be wary of it not working is zyprexa has a long half life. Yes i will start at 50mg & see what happens. Only time it didn;t work was because i had 5 & 6apb the night before so most likely cross tolerance. Oh well will see & report back.

i don't really like it


every time i have taken it, 

i always feel like something is caught in my throat

making it usually just uncomfortable, 

along with the chest bodyload, neck tightness


definitely have had some euphoria and psychedelic tones 

after the 1h-1.30h mark, and generally good well being in the tail end

but don't really see a use for the substance


i generally take 30-40mg and have taken up to 70mg, mainly orally

this did not feel good in my lungs, have not pursued that route


i have reagent tested it, not entirely sure if it is 5-meo-dalt or completely that

Can anyone tell me if my picture is real 5-MeO-DALT? Like i said before it's hard to describe it clumps together & looks sort of like wool, not a powder, definitely not powder looking.

that picture does no justice, no one could ever identify if it was anyways

your description somewhat matches my batch of "5-meo-dalt" definitely not a powder

You're not getting any effect because you've been taking olanzapine. That drug will kill any trip, and prevent you from tripping if taken before a psychedelic.

Uh, that's all this drug is good for. It's a quick burst of euphoria and colors. It reminds me of nitrous oxide in many ways.


I don't understand why you'd do anything but vaporize this stuff. Quick onset and short duration are what sets this chem apart.

If you smoke it you get a nice but short-lived body rush.  Not as nice as 5-meo-mipt, though.

I only took olanzapine for five days. Then I stopped for seven so that's not the problem. New vendor me thinks as someone said my description sounded Dodgy. Posted pic on previous page but spose can't really tell.also does this chem release serotonine dopamine or what ?

My "5-MEO-DALT" doesn't appear "wooly" like the post above. I have a powdery substance that is almost sparkly with distinct grains.


Last week I tried Schulgin's 20mgs and had a similar experience to his - fast onset (20 mins), short duration (3 hours), no visuals and good sex with gf. (This is the main reason I think it was labelled correctly.) I took the oral route, mixed with water. The stuff tastes foul - strong chemical flavour (makes me shudder just to write about it). The onset/duration is the reason I believe this is DALT. I've never had such a fast/brief chem before.


Last night I took 50mgs (mixed in water - it doesn't mix especially well though - time for gel-caps!). Experience was similar. There's a "trippy" feel - a sense that you are "on" something and a sort of warmth in the chest. No negative somatic sensations. It felt good to relax with my gf & stroke her. The music wasn't especially enhanced or anything (it was Bach) but - again - sex was. Orgasm came after a longer build up and had a "flowing" rather than spasmodic intensity. No sort of erectile dysfunction. So far, this feels more like a sex drug.


Next I'm going for 70mgs. 


Note: I'm 5.11, 150lbs, on no meds & am typically a tryptamine "hard-head" who usually needs extra LSD, 'shrooms, etc.

As above, but 70mgs.


First hour - heavy tracers. Felt a bit shaky. White objects seemed to glow a little.


Otherwise the same as 50mgs.

I do not doubt my source in the slightest, everyone here would know the reputation instantly and I would agree the stuff supplied me as 5-MeO-DALT was bunk. Utterly worthless, not worth repeating even at apparently stupid doses and yet I've read TRs elsewhere on other UK sourced stuff of it being full on hallucinogenic? I can't understand it?

^ What was your dosage and ROA? It takes some really high doses if you're looking for a "fully hallucinogenic" side of it like you say - even at fairly strong doses the visuals have been almost non-present in my experience other than some slight changes in perception and an increase in brightness. 


Does your powder have a notable indole/tryptamine taste/smell?

With redosing about 150mg over a 3 hour period or thereabouts, tried insufflation, oral and chasing trying to bring the stuff up enough to produce some proper activity. Wrote about my experiences [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/611382-The-Big-amp-Dandy-5-MeO-DALT-Thread-%28Part-2%29?p=10546443&highlight=dalt#post10546443) before. I was trying to be cautious having read up on dosing but don't think even bombing the 150mg in one would have produced anything all *that* worthwhile. Described the look of the stuff which seems absolutely correct but never the smell. Can't actually remember how it smelled to be honest. It's strange because I've read TRs where seemingly people have been getting strong visual effects at 50mg. Nothing of the sort for me.

What was your initial dose? It's worth noting there would have been significant tolerance between your redoses. Insufflation I've heard reports of people saying it doesn't work with the freebase - I'm not sure whether that's true or not but something you could potentially bear in mind. Oral requires quite high doses - and if you vaped it you must remember the taste at least, it's a very strong tasting chemical when vaped, not like DMT or aMT where the taste isn't so thick. 


I'm not sure though, I haven't explored high doses yet, but at the doses I've tried it was pleasant. A friend of mine using the same batch (Jinux on here) said he found it to be a full trip with a high oral dose and said 70mg was his best dose yet - so maybe it is worth another try just with a single larger oral dose just to see?

have tried various doses orally 50mg - 150 mg eyeballed. it's a pleasant compound imo, kind of puts you in a tryptamine headspace and gives you a tryptamine bodybuzz without any tryptamine headfuck. also, like all tryptamines i've tried, there's no noticeable hangover. it's very recreational in my opinion - because it's short lasting, unchallenging, and not very intense. but quite pleasant and wonderful for sex. have to say the 150mg dose i tried was a bit much bodyload wise - i started getting a bit worried about my heart - this is from someone who will quite happily munch 1g of molly or m1 or 500mg of 6apb in a session. at that dose images on tv etc were getting a bit distorted also like in a funhouse mirror.

How long does this thing last if stored in a cool dry place? Is it like the 2c-x things that are really stable and stay good for a long time or has it already degraded to be useless?


Have some from a few years ago, tried 20mg back then, wasn't really impressed (only got some stimulation and a little swirling in my peripheral vision), but reading this thread, I guess my dose was too low. And am considering trying it again.

I had a few drinks & popped a 40mg (not 90) gel-cap last night. Everything visual had a clarity, almost a shine... Really enjoyed dancing/moving my body to music & felt very sexual. Was easy for things to keep my attention (in a visual way - I stared into the bottom of a wine glass for a minute because it looked so good). Really very enjoyable! I'm starting to see this chemical as something that lends a clear sensuality to a few hours and also gives things a nice visual *blush*. (That's a good way to describe it.) Had found it disappointing at first, but once you accept it for it's own character, it is rather enjoyable (especially with sex).

Yes: [http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84710](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=84710)


Note how the MAOI dose is pretty low though. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Took about 50mg 5-meo-DALT and 25mg 4-ho-met and it produced an unexpectedly strong trip. Took me completely off guard and I am pretty hard headed when it comes to dosing psychedelics. This combo produced very good results

Allergy tested 5mg buccal and lightly touched me within about 10-15 minutes, felt like a caffeine buzz with more a more relaxed feel.

I then dosed 10mg up me nose and another 10mg sublingually approx 45 mins from the initial allergy test.

It proves to be very mildly visual OEV and noticeable CEV with a fairly prominent relaxed euphoric feel. Could have definitely been at a venue dancing my arse off! Music has a definite amped sound and feel.

4 hours in and it's beginning to settle back down to base line. Really nice chemical for what it is.

I wanted to dose more but in my opinion it feels like it has a sweet spot and any more would have just been annoying. No noticeable pupil dilation, raised or heavy heart beat (in fact at the 70-80 mark) and my veins looked fine. Sweated a bit more than usual. Could definitely take it at work for jokes kinda thing.

So this is the first RC that ive ever attempted to purchase from a vendor online. im pretty excited. i just hope that i get what i actually bought. so anyways my question is, how much does say a 20mg dose look like? how much powder is that approximately? im buying a scale specifically for this drug but i want to know how much 20mg or so looks like just in case i make a mistake reading the scale or anything that could go wrong where i misinterpret the weight. i plan to dose ~20mg thats why im asking what that dose looks like.  and this is assuming its pure of course.

No-one can tell you what "a 20mg dose looks like"! Just make sure you get a scale that works and it'll be fine.


The powder I have is white with a sort of fluffy texture (not shard-like, not grain-like, not-crystaline) & tends to stick to the sides of the plastic bag.

The scale should start on 0.000g and go up to 0.020g to indicate 20mg has been added. We can't tell you what 20mg looks like because different batches vary in density and we won't know how dense yours is.

ryand123 -  for clarity, my scale displays like this:


start on 0.00g 

looks like 0.02g to indicate 20mg


So be aware that scales display differently.


 - just remember there are 1000mgs in a gram and make sure your scale is set correctly. 20mgs on DALT is not much powder at all.

Better be careful with it; it only takes 5-10mg to feel something; I've heard of people fucking up when they got a whole g and tried to 'guess' what 10 mg looked like because their scale wasn't accurate enough

Just tried this 25mg gelcapped. Started off feeling mongy then got intense e like euphoria. It went up and down depending on music just like e.


Two and a half hours I would say it lasted then 90mins of residual.


Lovely stuff. HCL I had.


Very very tired next day just like E.


Tried smoking 7mg tonight and what a beautiful smell from it very aromatic indeed.


Not much of a hit though just like a joint of weed.


Must try plugging next.


Very good stuff for the price!

If you're using a scale that displays like this, be wary, it won't show a change from 21-29 mgs.

Just got sent a couple of branded pellet from an RC vendor purporting to contain 29% 5-Meo-DALT. The packet says it weighs 160mg, but I weighed the pellet at 130mg, so allowing for my scales being wrong (they aren't always accurate on low doses) it has 37-46mg of active ingredient in it. From reading this thread that seems a sensible dose if maybe on the low side.


I'm intrigued by comparisons to 2-CB, as 2-CB is pretty much the only proper psychedelic I feel comfortable out in public on. As I've only got two of these pellets so I can't really experiment beforehand, what are the likely effects of taking one pellet while out compared to 2-CB?

Has anyone had any bad/dangerous physical symptoms when pushing this to higher dosage rains? It seems to be the consensus that dosages of 60-70mg+ are required to get to a state of relatively strong tripping with this substance, with many people even reporting incredibly high doses of 100mg+, 5x+ the dosage listed in TiHKAL. 


This seems very high particularly for a 5-MeO tryptamine and while people seem to say this is the preferable level in terms of positive effects I'm wondering if anyone has experienced complications at these dose ranges, and if so what. 


I still have some of this stuff left over, 100mg or 110mg if I recall correctly, and I was thinking about taking 60-75mg orally for my next experiment since I've only messed with this one a few times now at small vaporised dosages for the "rush" and body high it produces - and would like to see where a more full experience takes me. I'm a bit wary about pushing the dosage so high though.


Although I quite enjoy the body high and feel this is the main aspect that made this worth exploring for me after just a few uses the taste of vaporised 5-MeO-DALT has become incredibly sickly and disgusting, and I feel like oral is probably going to be the way to go from now on, but if I'm going to go for oral I may as well go for a full on trip and not the lighter stimulating/entactogenic experience that low doses provide - since I was never able to push that high with vaping due to how bad it tastes.

^ Jesus -here are my experiences with oral doses thus far:


Last week I tried Schulgin's 20mgs and had a similar experience to his - fast onset (20 mins), short duration (3 hours), no visuals and good sex with gf. (This is the main reason I think it was labelled correctly.) I took the oral route, mixed with water. The stuff tastes foul - strong chemical flavour (makes me shudder just to write about it). The onset/duration is the reason I believe this is DALT. I've never had such a fast/brief chem before.


Last night I took 50mgs (mixed in water - it doesn't mix especially well though - time for gel-caps!). Experience was similar. There's a "trippy" feel - a sense that you are "on" something and a sort of warmth in the chest. No negative somatic sensations. It felt good to relax with my gf & stroke her. The music wasn't especially enhanced or anything (it was Bach) but - again - sex was. Orgasm came after a longer build up and had a "flowing" rather than spasmodic intensity. No sort of erectile dysfunction. So far, this feels more like a sex drug.


Next I'm going for 70mgs. 


Note: I'm 5.11, 150lbs, on no meds & am typically a tryptamine "hard-head" who usually needs extra LSD, 'shrooms, etc.


As above, but 70mgs.


First hour - heavy tracers. Felt a bit shaky. White objects seemed to glow a little.


Otherwise the same as 50mgs.

I agree with Jesusgreen that the taste can be unbearable from vaping. My solution has been to vape single doses with an essential vaaapp vaporizer one vial at a time. By loading 25mg in a vial and using a jet flame lighter, up to 20mg could be inhaled in 1-2 successive inhalations, tasting fine. However, when reheating the 5-MeO-DALT and vaping the remaining amount there would be an overwhelming, truly terrible taste which would really dominate the experience. Try to avoid reheating 5-MeO-DALT and use single doses of fresh material each time.

Jesus,


I have gone to 100mg's. Enjoyable surreal trip. Wouldn't recommend for less experienced trippers. Body high goes into the background as the head trip takes center stage. Things seemed like they had plastic wrap over them, everything was more glossy. This is sim to other 5-meo's at high doses I have noticed. Also the confusion is more than I get at really high doses of phen's. I never have anxiety so not sure if it would cause anxiety in others. Confusion in the sense that things started to become unfamiliar. I could see objects in my kitchen fine, but I couldn't navigate to find things. As if I was in someone elses kitchen. Same way when I was outside. Streets and signed are all fine and readable, but everything seemed unfamiliar and it became easy for me to get lost. I guess this is almost like a disassociative type effect.


Because I enjoy to challenge myself mentally and never experience anxiety on psych's this experience was counted enjoyable for its uniqueness and challenging aspect.

I can find some comparisons with 2C-B and this actually. They're very different in other ways but they're both extremely tactile and have some empathy to them. Many of the 5-MeO tryptamines share that aspect with 2C-B and similar psychedelics, it seems to be a characteristic of this subset of tryptamines.


With regards to the taste with vaporising it - it can be dealt with fairly easily. What I do is keep a nice big chocolate bar to hand, vape small hits at a time, and after each hit I take a few sips of juice and eat a tiny block of the chocolate bar. The juice gets rid of the immediate gag reflex and the chocolate then gets rid of the remaining taste. I'm sure other things work just as well but chocolate worked the best out of everything I've tried so far for this.


It's still nasty when the taste first hits but it doesn't last long this way, so if vaporising this compound is the preferred ROA for you then you can always try this. The issue for me is that when attempting to raise my doses a little the taste added a negative psychological component to the trip and made me feel a bit weird and anxious, and getting rid of the taste didn't quite completely eliminate it afterwards.


With oral dosing there's of course the option to bomb/parachute it in a rolling paper, bit of tissue, or something similar.

^^ I found the taste of this compound to be actually quite pleasant except when trying to vaporise the compound in smaller sips over time. Vaped hard in one or two inhalations the compound remains fresh tasting. It was also necessary to throw the residual amount in the vial afterwards - that's truly disgusting (the taste of the 5-MeO-DALT gets worse as it is vaporised/subjected to heat over time). 

As well as remaining fresh tasting, sweet even, getting a big hit fast delivers an incredible rush. I heat the vial with the loaded material and, as it is liquified by the jet flame, draw steadily and deeply as well as continuing to heat. This minimizes the temperature and shortens the heating time. The resulting vapor is smooth, almost sweet tasting with no bad side-effect from the taste.

Again, JesusG is correct that this chem does have a little empathogenic quality... now that I come to think of it.


Bombing is best with a gelcap. Tissue paper can stick in the mouth/throat, resulting in a disgusting sensation.

Dunno if people are still interested in this stuff anymore. However I had never tried insufflation of the hcl. 1 cup of coffee first so I could wake up (caffeine needy in the morning!) Then ate a decent meal.

SO I 30mg'd up me nose. Instant burn and throat irritation. Nothing that bad.

20 minutes later I could not sit still. Music sounded amazing but kept changing from amazing to average to boring. I listened to Drum n Bass as it seemed to go with how fast I was going. Mild but appreciated visuals and couldn't tell facial emotions from people. Feeling REALLY sped up almost on the same level as mephedrone and the whole walking around a park thing. Felt chatty so chatted a lot of shit on facebook.

-BPM approx 90.

Then I went for a skate (board) with definite psychedelic properties coming around. I couldn't tell my speed I was going at as the roads stretched and flexed. I forgot half the time I was on a board, which is natural to me, but there was a serious disconnection that I am going fairly fast with traffic and I could be in danger. Just like LSD and skateboards!

-BPM checked after I stopped at a corner. Approx 110-120. No vaso constriction noticed. No heavy pounding or seeming palpitations.

Now that I am coming down I don't feel bad at all no loss of natural energy for this time of day. DOES give you the munchies!???? It seems to be a diuretic. So anyone suffering from an UTI or damaged bladder take note!

All round, an amazing drug for 3 hours of fun.

Peaked for around 2 hours with residual stim at 3 hours still feeling nice. <Actually the visuals are staying rather than the stimulation at the 3 hour mark.

Powder consisted of that tan tryptamine colour. The drug was acquired off of a trusted (as trusty as you can get lol) vendor.

Well I still have a bag of it a few years old and am kinda interested in it. Is it possible to get any worthwhile visuals and other psy effects from it? Most I ever got was uncomfortable stimulation + a little twirling in my peripheral vision.

i have done doses up to 100mg with no ill effects (might have a bit of a tolerance now though). before i had scales i eyeballed amounts could have been 125-150 mg and my heart rate went up pretty high, i was feeling a lot of physical tension. if you want a more intense experience than 100mg can give you just go for another drug. i would say 20-30 mg is probably too low and the main reason a lot of ppl says it doesn't do much.


i love this stuff. it just feels so clean. it's nowhere near as intense as shrooms or cactus can be but on the upside wonderfully functional.


i did all my doses oral. works great have no idea why you would want any other ROA.


one more thing i've noticed - i used to smoke a lot of pot but now i've stopped it lasts a bit longer.

I feel like every time I've tried this, it's one of those drugs that Shulgin developed and decided it wouldn't be worth looking any further. I find the body and head LOAD to be far too hefty for the actual wanted effects. I can't remember the oral dose I did but all I did was be uncoordinated and loved tensing the erector spinae, resulting in back pain. I recently vaped a small dose and it just felt like I'd stood up far too quickly. I might give it one more chance in the future with weed and nos though, maybe some drugs just arent for some people

I think I've developed a tolerance to it rather quickly. Got 2 grams last week - couple weeks ago, and am down to about a gram. I "smoked" it first, and while it was tingly and rushy and kind of reminded me of a dxm trip for about a minute, the taste was so nasty. Insufflated, even 80mg didn't do much for me. (After having developed this tolerance.)


I dropped some concentrated doses in my ear canal to see if it would do anything and all of a sudden I could understand what my dog was saying. <----- just kidding


Just had that thought while on it, though. lol

Hello,


I received a sample of 5-MeO-DALT from a reliable source (100mg). The powder is extremely white/shiny, it looks like snowflakes or cotton-like. First time I saw a "powder" like that ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I will try 5mg ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I see a lot of mixed results here. I can't really define the effects of this chem... Does it feels euphoric or pushy ? Does it have a great bodyload ?

Is it hard on the heart ? 


Anyway I will start very low (5mg) with oral consumption ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Thanks !

Just learned that in order for the plug ROA to work the freebase has to be converted to its salt. A little vinegar added to the solution and MAN I am tripping balls with just a small amount. Now I can skip the nasty smoking because it tastes so bad. (Orally it just doesn't have desired effect.)

Yes. 100mg with just enough water and vinegar (at about 50% ratio) to solute the 5-MEO-DALT.


Much more psychedelic. Visuals, auditories. Although very stimmy, too. and with lots of stress on the vitals, I can tell.


Very sexually stimulating. I mean, almost to the point where the ejaculatory reflex is engaged in the background of everything.

smoking 10mg of 5-meo-DALT reminded me of smoking 5-meo-DMT. very unpleasant onset. hard on the vitals, disorientating, vasoconstrictive (almost triggered a migraine). no visuals and quite nothing you might expect from a tryptamine, which lead me baffled. maybe i was not in the best shape that day, so i will try again.


is there a special ROA for this? vaping is not the way to go, it seems.

The rectal ROA seems to be the most effective, short of intravenous, which I haven't and don't expect to do.


Dissolved in vinegar (acetic acid) or lemon juice (citric acid), common household acids, with some water to dilute the acidity a bit, it's a very fast, rather long-lasting experience. (three-four hours for high >75mg doses)


Try it out. Use a small dose at first, and you will still be amazed. 2g of this chemical goes very far in a very effective way.

I plan on buying the scale mentioned elsewhere in this thread: 

[http://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM](https://www.amazon.com/American-Weigh-Gemini-20-Portable-Milligram/dp/B0012TDNAM)


But still, working with doses as small as 20-25mg seems both to require extreme diligence and tiny measuring spoons, etc., and pushes the scale's accuracy to its limits. Also, my eyes and hands aren't cut out for such tiny, delicate work!


So, just to get things on a more easily manageable scale for working with, can anybody see a flaw with the following plan? I intend to combine one gram of the active substance with 3g of rice flour, then subdivide the 4g mixture into 40 (100mg) capsules, which should contain very close to 25mg of active substance in each capsule.


Seems to me that this would be not only less strenuous in terms of working with it, but it should enhance the accuracy of the scale (for our purposes), since a 4mg error would only contain 1mg of active substance. Therefore if you can get accurate dosing within 5mg, you should be only +/- a little over 1mg!


How is that not a good thing?


EDIT: Forgot to mention that to facilitate mixing, I would use a food container (the kind of container with a snap-on lid), add the 3-plus-1 grams of ingredients, seal the lid and shake vigorously for a minute or so, and then get busy portioning onto a slick paper (with the scale tared to the weight of the paper) for filling the capsules. Anybody not with me?

The powders still won't mix perfectly unfortunately, it's likely you'll end up with hotspots and sometimes consuming pure rice flour. 

Honestly, unless you're fucked it's difficult to mess up the weighing process. I use a small screwdriver instead of a spatula, and it works perfectly. 1 heaped flat ended screwdriver = roughly 2mg, so I know roughly how many scoops it'll take to get 20mg or 40mg. I can then add that many heaped scoops and then change for the measure I want.


If your compound is stable in water and your scales aren't accurate, it's worth doing liquid measurements as found in the volumetric dosing thread somewhere

**solano**, I have that scale, and it's fucking good for the price. It seems capable of measuring doses as low as 4 or 5mg, and holds it's callibration like a bastard. It actually seems as good as the expensive Acculab VIC123 that I had a couple of years back! It just doesn't give you that sense of being in a laboratory, and doesn't take five minutes to set up. It *can't* be as accurate, but it always seems to get my calibration weights right.


If you're weight out single-digit milligram doses of a potent chemical you should use liquid volumetric measurement, but for chems that are just threshold at that level I think it's fine.

I got myself some of this stuff recently. Tried a 50mg dose and didn't really get anything at all from it. With most drugs where this has happened (most), I usually push the dose up higher and see what there is to be seen. With this though for some reason I haven't. I don't know why, but it just doesn't call to me like the others have. Dunno why. Would you guys recommend it?

Thank you, knock! I especially appreciate the feedback on the scale. Ordered! I think in addition to the scale, I'll get one of these scoops 

[http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00762WVYS/ref=pd_aw_sim_k_4?pi=SL500_SS115](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00762WVYS/ref=pd_aw_sim_k_4?pi=SL500_SS115)

so I don't have to eyeball it so much when loading the scale. My target dose is ~30mg, so the combo of a good scale and this scoop should make that fairly easy.

Out of all the chems, I find myself craving this one most. I've been chem-free for a couple of weeks, and I'm going to make a call to Mike E. Oldes-Dalton.

Never candy-flipped, so I can't answer that.

As this is my first post, I'd like to pass along some of my advice when dealing with any such experiments.


1) You can always add more, you can Never take back.

2) Don't eyeball quantities. Spend the 20 bucks to get a scale.

3) Don't take anything without careful study and consideration of other factors.


You get the idea.


There have been mention of nootropic like affects from other sources I must agree. 

Though the measurements were higher than normal (100mg+) orally, (I don't recommend unless you are experienced)

It may be possible to enhance this nootropic effect by adjusting the compound slightly, and/or perhaps even a highly controlled time released version. 


Indications of affects were quite impressive. (6-8hr) 4 of which at a true +4. I strongly believe this compound has true potential with proper and careful research.

Both the hydrochloride salt and freebase forms of 5-MEO-DALT will vaporize and will have psychoactive effects if inhaled. 


Keep in mind that the hydcrochloride salt has approx 12% less active 5-MEO-DALT by weight than the freebase when considering dosages.

from my experience, the hydrochloride salts of tryptamines can be vaporized, but of course freebase is to preferred for this ROA. when vaporizing tryptamine HCl salts, part of it will burn, resulting in material loss and harsh smoke.


that being said, I have already successfully vaporized 5-MeO-DALT HCl, but because of the mentioned problems, I did not push the dose very far; thus the effects were nothing to write home about.

Yesterday M received 2 grams of 5-Methoxy-DALT HCl and dosed with it several times. M feel's the strong need to weigh in on this chemical because of all the people who said it lacks a strong visual component. It seems many people's doses are not large enough to bring out the wonderful visual and truly psychedelic properties of this great drug. M started off with a line weighing 45 mg thinking he would need a second to get visuals. Initially there was no burn, but after 5 min. when it it his throat there was an intense burning sensation. Then BAM! M could hardly stand as he smoked my cigarette and began to enter visual land. The earth was breathing with him. Every wall turned to a rubbery material that was moving quickly inward and outward as if they were lungs. As M went into to my room geometric patterns emerged everywhere! He got up close to the wall and stood up against them watching the insane patterns form and change. He had rented Django the night before but only watched half so M started it back up. Holy shit! The movie was beyond amazing sober, but watching the second half's gunfights & and thick plot  and action at Candyland was orgasmic on 5-MeO-Dalt! Intense visuals lasted for about 45 minutes before beginning to decline. After about 2 hours M was becoming rapidly sober to the point it felt like I hadn't even taken a drug. M doses 20 mg orally, then 40 min. later another 10 mg sublingually and this brought him back to a beautiful, psychedelic state of mind but with far more mild visuals than before, like that of a good aMT trip. This drug also brought about a great sexual nature as well a strong entactogen state, not unlike MDMA. M bought 500 mg of aMT and received 840 mg of aMT freebase (crazy they sent him 300+ free mg) and 5-MeO-DALT blew aMT out of the water! Lately, the HCl salt is becoming rarer and the freebase is more available. M definitely prefers the HCl salt because he finds insufflation to be the most visual route with a dissociative empathogen aspect, needing only about 25 mg to do so . M highly recommends it at doses of 30-60 mg orally for those who want a more mellow trip with milder visuals and more grip on one's self. For psychedelic drug lovers, like M's self, he recommend 50-80 mg orally as this induces potent visuals and various types of hallucinations including wild visuals somewhat like shrooms. On one occasion M vaporized about 8-12 mg of the HCl on some cannabis and the effects were a bit speedier. They included a semi-rapid heart rate, a strange psychedelic glow on objects but not visuals, and a stronger dissociative effect. If one obtained several grams of freebase and wanted to convert it to the HCl salt it would be pretty simple and M, who loves chemistry plans on doing it. Hope my buddy M's been able to shed some light of this most delightful chemical...

My first post,


My roommate and I ordered a gram of 5-MeO-DALT from a trusted online vendor in HCL form, after collecting our research notes we invited over trusted friends who joined in the testing seasons.


Test 1, 70mg Orally ingested.

Subject has no heath issues and has plenty of Hallucinogen experience. 

Complaints about stomach pain, laying on his back makes the pain go away. Listening to music is very easy and the listener finds pleasure in the music.

Reports +.


Test 2, 70mg Orally, 20mg Nasal Insufflation.

Subject has a chronic pain disorder, Caution is used during this test.

Complaints about whole body pain, finds pleasure in music but the pain makes the whole experience undesirable. User drinks plenty of water and the pain subsides. 

Reports +.


Test 3, 70mg Orally.

Subject has no known heath issues, however user has drug abuse issues that effect his day to day life.

Slight closed eye visuals, music is pleasurable and the user spends a hour listening to music on his headphones, having no desire to talk to the rest of the group. 

Reports ++.


Test 4, 70mg Orally, 70mg Orally. 

Subject has no known heath issues.

No effects.

Reports +/-.


On his second dose user decides to distance himself from the group. He takes a walk and returns 20 minutes later. He reports no visuals but found conversation meaningless at the time, and needed some fresh air. This is out of character,

Reports +.


Few notes where made on this substance by our group, there wasn't any clear effects of the drug other then on Test 2, where the users tolerance to pain dropped, thus causing his chronic pain disorder to act up. Has anyone else experienced pain while on 5-MeO-DALT? It'll be pointless to get everyone together again to test this drug once more, nobody really felt any connection between how they felt and the drug.

^really strange reports, i'd seriously question the quality of the 5-meo-dalt; or maybe chalk it off to this certain drugs variable character?


30mg orally produces intense vibing body rushes and intertwines with strange rushes of energy throughout the body; that if focused upon become euphoric

and psychedelic. On 4 different friends or so 25-35mg produces very desirable results, especially for dancing or seeing live music.


pretty cool compound, it has it's own special place in the cornucopia of psychedelia

Quality may be questionable, though the vendor I work with has in the past been of best quality. Perhaps I'll need to dive into this substance again and give it another shot, though I won't make the order for a while.

Has anyone tried vaporizing a combination of this and 5-MEO-MIPT? I obviously need to sample some of this on its own first but from my experiences with 5-MIPT and from what I here about 5-DALT there seems to be potential for some great synergy.

True, but you dosed 20mg, and his doses were all ~70mg; also in my post i stated at least 25mg is needed to garner significant psychedelic effects, and 35mg is recommended.


I'm pretty confident you'd feel some rushing body feelings if/when you ever attempt 5-meo-dalt again at 30mg+,

please report back if you do because i'd be interested either way!

i'd always assumed all the people that got nothing from it were hard heads or tripping every weekend, but no. Its just the nature of the beast. It feels like i'm gunna come up then it suddenly fades to nothing.

If anything ive found higher doses even less effective [ i've dosed pretty high, gave up weighing it on the last occasion and just hoovered up huge lines ] The higher doses inexplicably seem to fade quicker, i know that makes no sense but thats what ive experienced.


I find it neutral emotionally, no mood lift or euphoria, so if body rushes were what i was looking for i can think of several better alternatives.


I never bothered trying to vape it because i lost all interest in it.


tl;dr


Its just not very good. I'm glad some people enjoy it but those people are in the minority. The people who get nothing from it probably never will, even if they do loads of it


in fact its so poor that im always surprised to see this thread bumped to the 1st page and the conversation always seems the same, its just the names that change =-]

Poor swines... 5-meo-DALT is the best sex drug I've ever found... more so than MDMA, MDA, the APBs... I just avoid too much food, otherwise it is shit-city. No fun... unless you like shit. ;P

 That's how it was for me originally.  very potent. I  must have developed a tolerance through too much use.

I have combo'd (vaped and orally) this many times, and you are right, there is great synergy here. I usually prepare a bowl of cannabis, with one part 5-meo-mipt and 2-3 parts 5-meo-dalt. Hold on tight, one helluva body rush incoming, watch your heart rate and temps. The dalt variant provides a lot more stimulation than it's mipt counterpart, but the mipt is still the stronger of the two effects. The DALT's effects will vanish quickly, within 15 minutes, so you may wish to vape more. MIPT's effects will last about an hour or so when vaped. Combined the two are highly sexual ime

^Thanks for the response, that's exactly what I was hoping to hear. I'm going to sample the DALT tonight and then give the combo a go in a few days when the mrs and I have a couple days off together. Might have to have a mini "laaay-cation"%)

Reading through all your previous posts in the thread, do you still use 30-40mg orally? I'm quite interested in the reports of nice experiences at doses in the 20-40mg oral range because I've still yet to try any ROA other than vaped with this one myself, and due to my limited amount of material I'm still unsure whether to go for a much higher dose like 70-80mg, or stick to one closer to the dose Shulgin himself tried.


The friend who gave me the material suggested dosing high to me, but at least with the vaped ROA I found when I pushed the dosage higher there was a very uncomfortable and nauseating bodyload, rather than the pleasant electric bodyhigh which I had at lower doses - and this is why I'm still unsure which oral dose range will be right for me.


Those of you who also get an unpleasant bodyload when taking higher doses, at what sort of dose range does this begin to appear orally? Or this this something mostly unique to the faster onset of the vaped ROA?

it is a psychedelic stimulant, so like any stimulant, this is a possibility. 


if your tolerance for Etizolam is already built up, it might work with vaping. More likely though is that the Etizolam will prevent (or at least mute) any action from the 5meoDALT.

I haven't taken this for well over a year now as it never worked when I was prescribed Citalopram, I gave it up 3 weeks ago. From what I remember I found 5-meo a great drug so I placed an order. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I would imagine it would go really well with codeine and akb48f.

Yeah, could be handy. Had a bit of anxiety towards the end last time I used it, and a couple of mg of Etiz had me cuddled up in my duvet and coming down easily.

A few moments ago decided to give 5-Me0-DALT a go, so I insuflated a tiny amount as a allergy test and all it has given me is a bit of a headache on around my right temple.. any thoughts? Also my DALT is pure powder and colour just of white.

Having said I agree with the dosages stated by Psyke I watched a uk doccumentary the other night about legal highs and one guy was talking about friends of his who were taking 10 x 40mg pills in one go!!!!


Obviously a wreckless dosage and not reccomended for anyone!

ok so i've used this stuff pretty extensively for nearly 2 years now, as often as multiple times a week. I cannot tell if there is any tolerance build up, if it is, it's minimal. 


I have stored it in the bag it came in, with no other special methods for storage. Potency appears unchanged. 


I find overall this to be an amazing drug. Vaping it is preferred over the oral; oral doses aren't strong enough. 


The only concerning thing about this drug is after using, sometimes my kidneys tender and sore. I would really like to know what this is, and if its a long term health concern. I have read a few other reports mentioning the same thing.

Anyone tried mixing this with MDMA, at high doses? As far as I know all tryptamines are MAOI's (or not?confirm please) so is it safe to combine 5-meO-DALT with an amphetamine or MDMA as far as maoi and serotonin syndrome is a concern?

Didn't want to start a new thread for this, but...


I've just taken somewhere in the range of 25-30mg orally (probably closer to 30mg). I just mixed it with a little lemon juice and water and necked it. I now plan to spend the new few hours playing games, playing guitar, doing whatever takes my fancy. I've never taken 5-MeO-DALT before but the short come-up and duration (and relatively light effects) makes it seem perfect for a bit of daytime faffing.


**Anyway, my question: how long after taking 5-MeO-DALT would it be safe to smoke some changa?** It's good stuff, and obviously a MAOI. I would imagine that 5-MeO-DALT has at least some serotonin activity so I wouldn't smoke the changa whilst actually on the DALT. Assuming that I'm back to baseline at 2pm, would it  be safe to smoke at... 3pm? 4pm? The next day? The day after?


Thanks!

kind of a threshold dose for oral, but duration is about 4 hours total. Vaping is recommended, esp for hardheads, duration is 15-45 minutes, but can redose safely, repeatedly.

Here's what happened to me if anyone fancies reading something long:


Here is my report on 5-meo-DALT, I’m writing this 3 days after taking it, to be completely honest I was a bit silly with my dosage, this is partially down to being an idiot and partially down to the last batch I had apparently not being very good.

I purchased 1g of this around a year ago, at that time it was a white, almost fluffy powder, extremely difficult to arrange in to lines, at that time I started with a small line, followed by several small bombs and can’t say I felt much until I’d taken quite a lot, roughly 200mg, at which point I had some minor trails in my vision and a very mild body buzz… That is where the similarities to this gram, which I bought about a week ago from a different online source end.

The current batch is a beige, almost tan coloured substance of the same consistency as the last, assuming (stupidly) that the potency wouldn’t be much different I poured (this was a bad idea, measuring is definitely the way forward) what I would say must have been 80-100mg in to a cigarette paper and washed it down. I had eaten a sandwich around 3 hours earlier so would have been on close enough to an empty stomach. While filling the rizla I also spilled a tiny amount on to the table, so proceeded to taste this, it was foul and had a strong, bitter, chemical taste which I fond hard to get rid of, this taste also leads me to think that snorting would be a terrible idea.

The first effects came on after roughly 30 minutes, my perception of distance completely changed, oddly corners began to look very odd, also small things such as a spider web on my wall stood out a lot more than normal. The body buzz was also quite strong almost immediately. The effects intensified in waves, my depth perception was changing rapidly and the buzz became more and more intense, I also noticed an increased temperature.

After about 30 minutes after onset I decided to go outside to smoke a cigarette, as I sometimes find with mushrooms I was concerned with what my neighbours would think if they saw me, however I was still capable of rational thought and deduced that I probably didn’t look as wrecked as I felt so carried on. My perception of time had changed by this point, but after half a cigarette I began to notice background noises becoming very loud so decided to put the cigarette out and go back inside to lay down. 

I sat on my sofa for around 15 minutes (I only know this because this is where I paused the music I was listening to) before everything became far too intense, I felt completely restless and was experiencing a massive body rush as well as strong audio hallucinations, I also noticed that completely made up words kept entering my mind. I wandered from room to room and kept thinking that if I could get comfortable I would start to enjoy the experience.

At this point I went upstairs and decided to lay in bed, I checked my watch at this point and it was roughly an hour after onset. The audio hallucinations became more and more intense and I had what I can only describe as a psychedelic overlay on my vision, shapes were completely distorted, edges became sharp and everything appeared to taper in towards the centre. Moving my hands in front of my face produced neon trails and I had visions of what I can only describe as 2 people made from several oval shapes, sitting together… I can’t really describe how I was seeing this however, as I knew it wasn’t there but was aware of it whether my eyes were open or closed. My muscles also felt very tense, especially my wrists.

I could not rest while laying down so continued to wander around the house, my perception was heavily altered still and I had to keep telling myself that the effects would eventually die down to a pleasant level. Although I did not feel sick I decided to try to vomit, but gave up very quickly.

I continued to experience heavy CEV’s, psychedelic trails and a complete distortion of perception for around 2 more hours before out of nowhere the body buzz significantly calmed down. At this point I was able to lay on my bed and relax, the visuals were still as strong, if not stronger, but the buzz was replaced with a feeling of relief at being over the worst of it and the experience actually became very pleasant from this point onwards. I could now focus on my watch and the screen of my phone again, however my phone did look completely different, the font appeared to change and everything was more clear. Something I also took great pleasure from was the trails, as it appeared as though I could throw neon fireballs if I pushed my hands forward… I spent around an hour laying on my back doing this (I’m glad I was at home along as I would struggle to explain myself to a sober person), before deciding that I was now in a fit state to go back downstairs and ride out the rest of the trip.

The next hour was spent listening to music, I decided to listen to some Venetian Snares, some of it is quite frantic, but this seemed to make perfect sense and sounded very tight compared to while sober. The visuals had dies down, apart from the text on my computer screen appearing to drop down, then expand periodically, my phone also still looked different.

At around 4.5 hours after onset I was standing outside when I came back down to earth with a bang… Sort of, the psychedelic layer over my visuals fell off almost completely and I felt slightly tired and quite hungry… This was not a gradual process, I went from feeling one way to feeling another within a split second.

At this point I decided to go and meet some friends as I was now feeling in control again, the walk from my house to the bus stop takes roughly 15 minutes, during the walk I felt very positive and was highly entertained by my own thoughts, enjoying picking apart the last few hours in my head. The feeling was similar to taking a small dose of MDMA, however it didn’t last much longer than half an hour before I gradually returned to baseline.

After the effects had worn off I stayed out for around 4 hours, had a few beers and was maybe slightly more chatty than usual, I got home at around midnight and had no problem sleeping and woke at around 8:45am the next day with no hangover.

In hindsight I really should have measured it, while I would say that overall it was a good experience, the come up got a bit hairy at times and was hard work. I would liken the experience to mushrooms, except the visuals were quite digital for me and seemed to be more distorted than I have ever experienced on any other psychedelic or hallucinogenic. The made up words thing I experienced has only ever happened to me before on LSD, however that is probably where the similarities between that and 5 meo DALT end.

I would be interested in trying a smaller dose, maybe half of what I took on this occasion, as I feel that if the come up had not been so intense and frantic that I would have enjoyed the entire experience and not just the end. 

I should also say that I do not recommend anyone starting on even half of the dose I took, especially if they are not experienced with large doses of other psychedelic or hallucinogenic substances. There were a lot of times during the first couple of hours where things could easily have gone the wrong way, however my internal monologue is pretty good at keeping me grounded even when my body and the rest of my brain have other ideas.

Hope this helps somebody. Take care.

How long do you guys find that cross-tolerance to other psychedelics last when you vaporize this one? I am planning on doing HOT-7 tomorrow and I dont want to have diminished effects. I'm considering vaporizing 1-2 doses of 5-MeO-DALT tonight. Do you guys find that it has a lasting tolerance or a tolerance similar to smoking DMT that dissipates very quickly?

I have done this chemical in 15 - 35 mg doses and it always was pretty strong for me. I know this varies from vendor to vendor but I believe what I have is very pure chemical. I like this one. The weird thing happened today. Dropped ~25mg today after about an hour and a half after having a light lunch and almost nothing happened. It was weird, because even at doses like 15mg's I always felt it. I had a bowl of soup maybe an hour later and after ingesting the soup I kind of started feeling trippy. But just a little bit. Now it's been 4 hours after ingestion and I still feel like just a little bit tripping, but just a little bit. There is this weird headspace I'm in right now and altrough I can't say I'm intoxicated, but I am not sober too! I feel like I'm on benzos or something , very weird feeling. This drug never lasted more than 2 hours for me and always kicked in like 15minutes, but now I'm in this weird rainy,sad but calm state of mind for 4 hours but I never reach full psychedelic effects. I have been taking 5-htp after the weekend but I didn't take it today ( altrough probably has nothing to do with it), and have no idea why this is happening. Has anyone been in a similar situation?


EDIT: I remembered that after dropping the initial dose I also took a little pill of valerian extract which I take from time to time just to calm me down a little bit, but I doubt that this may be the case??

Try to dissolve it in water. If it doesn't dissolve well, it's the freebase. Add a few drops of citric acid or acetic acid (lemon juice or vinegar) to convert it to its salt.

Hey guys,


...first post!


So I'm going to a rave/jungle night soon and am planning on taking some 5-meo-dalt. I'll be taking it for the first time, so what dosage would people recommend? I was thinking 30-40mg? Also, I might combine it with a line or two of MPA, is this combination safe? Do you think it's a good combination idea?


Thanks in advance ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have done this combo before and I quite liked it . THe strange thing is that 5-meo-DALT effects me differently in different settings. For instance, when I took it at home with my gf it was amazing, I can swear it was as nice as good dose of MDMA with some visuals. But when I took it at a a party it didn't feel as good, but maybe that was because I felt urge to vomit all the time, maybe because of alochol... Anyways have fun , I think this combo is OK

Hi all! I read all messages here, about 5-meo-dalt. Want to order 5gr of it, and 5gr of aMT. What would be the effect of this two chemicals combination? 40mg dalt and 30mg amt for example..

pretty unknown territory. I would strongly advise trying both them alone first. aMT is pretty stimulating, and so is 5meoDALT for me, esp at 40mg. Be careful and enjoy.

I think I've tried this... three times now.  The first time was 40mg orally, it had very little effect, I felt like I was coming up... then it stayed at that and wore off just as quickly.  I tried it again, I can't remember the dosage, it might have been 40mg, with some MPA and ketamine, but the effects of the other two overrode it.


However, on the third attempt, I was pleasantly surprised.  I took 70mg orally on a completely empty stomach having not eaten all day, and been to the gym, so I was starving.  It took maybe 20 to 40 mins to kick in, and it was fairly good.  It is definitely not that visual and more about the headspace, and somewhat euphoric in a way I've never really felt before, but it definitely had more of a psy than stim feel to it.  It didn't take away my hunger and I had something to eat on it and it was SO nice. Also, the experience was much more intense with eyes closed than open and music was even better on it.  


Fairly enjoyable drug, but I doubt I'll be re-purchasing it anytime soon.  There are just better drugs out there and I'm not sure what this drug has to offer really when there are other cheap psy RCs available like aMT.

This drug feels like it hits all the wrong 5-ht receptors.  Don't get me wrong, I kind of like it.  But with the ROA I have tried (only smoking) it gives no real trip before the side effects feel too "intense".  Makes you feel flashes if you get too much (you know, the panicky feeling like your brain is going crazy.. zappy), makes you feel WAY fucked up to walk, gives a heavy as hell heartbeat, great relaxing body high (while the tachycardia and wild mind high destroy any relaxation) and worst of all, when I did a somewhat heavy smoked dose my teeth felt like the nerves were vibrating and painful and my teeth were filled with electricity.


Still, it's good in small amounts as a supplemented high, and I'm guessing the intensity of body effects and "flashes" will prepare me for an actual tryptamine trip where I will experience all this and more without worry of danger.  Basically it gives you the intensity of a tryptamine high, with a fairly stimulating side, without the trip... it's like a major tryptamine buildup to an uncomfortable body high.  However, once it settles it is much more easy going.

hi everyone..

so I think I'm gonna order some 5 meo dalt as reading from tihkal and various TRs it seems an interesting substance with a short duration which I seek because I don't have experience with trypts and was looking for something that doesn't last for ages like amt for example...

so, how does tolerance build up with this one?

I mean, if I were to snort an amount and then another dose when I feel I'm coming down there would be any significant decrease in the effects?

I have never tried redosing with this one but I've read that it works just as good as first time. 


However, I never felt anything from snorting it. Has anyone felt anything from snorting it ? Freebase is inactive when snorted but Hcl is if I understand right? Can somebody clear it up for me ? Is there a way to turn freebae into Hcl easily for nasal ROA?

I liked this chem but it somehow makes me feel very sick on the stomach few last times... I wonder why

^^ 

mmh I don't have a great chemistry knowledge but I think adding an acid should turn it into the hcl form?

I'm not too sure tough, hope someone with a greater knowledge on the matter chimes in.

This chemical is FANTASTIC. I found it to be easy on the body (on low dose like 10 - 45mg ORAL). I like the subtle stimulation (feels like a tiny amount of MDMA), vibrant coulours and a nice euphoria. This chem is perfect to do in a rave party, festival, club, in nature!


The cheap price is also a great value, one of the best chem I tried so far!!

Alcohol ?

All the time. Never had any problems or surprises. I really enjoy mixing the two.

Bit of a tough one to answer.

I've done 5-meo-dalt so many times now that I feel fully comfortable with it so no longer weigh it.


I have found layering up by sticking my finger in a bag and just rubbing it under my tongue or into my gums works best for me.


A big one-off dose tends to just make me uncomfortable and I've found the alcohol flushes it through my system fairly quickly anyway so dosing large and hoping it'll see you through the whole evening won't work IMO / IME.


I think the best answer I can give you is to just try it at home first. Get a few cans of your usual tipple and your bag of 5meo-dalt and just experiment, don't go mad.

I kinda discovered it by accident TBH, it won't quite take the edge of the booze in that same way a stim does. But it *almost* does. I find I tend to wake up feeling refreshed rather than hung over if I'm sensible with the alcohol.


PS - as for the DXM. I honestly think that sounds terrible. But DXM just makes me ill anyway. I tend to see 5meo-dalt as a mild stim rather than a psych so, IMO it wouldn't be a disso / pych combo....

anyone tried with MDMA? I'm asking because I would like to prolong my roll dividing the MDMA dose in half, and taking 1 half + MeO-Dalt and when I'm beginning to comedown repeat. is this a good idea?

I've done it with mdma, I liked it. Popped a pill and then hour in to experience dropped 5-meo-dalt. Don't know whats your dosage so can't comment. 

However, I find that amphetamine and 5-MeO-DALT ir the superb combo. Extremely euphoric in it's own , unique and beautiful way.

I've finally gotten around to trying this one. 

I ate 25 mg in a gel capsule a few weeks back and the trip was extremely mild but definitely present. The body has sensations similar to light dose mushroom, or 5-MeO-MiPT might be a better comparison. No visuals. Little pupil dilation. 

Then last night I tried it smoked, 15 mg. It was pretty euphoric physically, but had the sensation of vibration occurring in the legs. Mentally it was clear, and The Simpsons was enjoyable to watch. No real depth of cognition or emotion.

This morning I again gave it a go, 20 mg smoked. The hit came out a little harsh and the taste of the chemical not properly burning made me slightly nauseous. The leg vibration sensation was noticed again. The euphoria is present, but it does not feel as clean or natural as 4-AcO-DMT (freebase) smoked. It is more similar to 5-MeO-MiPT smoked in terms of bodily effects, but the euphoria is certainly more prominent. Stretching feels good as it does on most other psychedelic tryptamines. No visuals noticed at this dose, slight depth of thought. 

Overall I am very impressed with how gentle this compound is when smoked, and how benign its actions are on cognitive processes.

Has anyone combined 5-meo-dalt with 5-meo-mipt? If so how was the experience? I ask because I think I may have accidentally mixed a decent quantity of moxy into my 800mgs of 5-meo-dalt bag by mistake. So here's the backstory for anyone interested, I was tripping on aMT one night and added a bit of 6-apb on the comedown... had a fucking fantastic time however I was overstimulated once the effects wore off so I dosed 3mgs of etizolam to help me get ready for bed which is an average dose for me, well I blacked out and woke up with a great deal of my moxy missing (I started out with 115mgs and woke up with 35). During this time I know I ingested both 5-meo-dalt and 5-meo-mipt as I had written down notes apparently but I never wrote down the doses.


For the longest time I thought I just ingested an insane amount of moxy during this blackout and/or dropped some but I'm starting to think that I may have accidentally placed the moxy into the 5-meo-dalt bag as they were the same color, I was using both substances, and I was obviously insanely intoxicated, I also wrote down that doses were insufflated so there's no way I snorted 80mgs of moxy, although people do stupid shit during blackouts so idk. I apparently spilled half of my 150mg etizolam vial in the process as well. Anyways, I'm sort of sketched out to take a dose of 5-meo-dalt in fear of a moxy "hotspot" and the fact that both of these chems cause some pretty nasty side-effects for me. I have mixed up the supposed cocktail 5-meo-dalt powder quite vigourously but the fact that there may be an insanely potent chemical in there makes me wonder if I should just throw it out. I wanna give 5-meo-dalt another chance, though orally so I'm just curious if anyone with experience with the combo can elaborate as to what sort of side-effects experienced as there's practically no info on the combo between moxy and 5-meo-dalt.

Never tried 5-MeO-DALT with 5-MeO-MiPT. Does your 800 mg of 5-MeO-DALT weigh more than it should? I know you dosed both, but if you mixed the 80 mg 5-MeO-MiPT into the 800 mg 5-MeO-DALT, the current mass should give some indication of whether it was spilled or mixed in.

The thing is I didn't know the weight, I just bought a gram and and only scaled out doses, never the whole batch. 800mgs is just a rough estimate to give you an idea of a ratio of -dalt to -mipt. There's litterally no way I could ever find out if did mix them besides sending it in but I could just get another gram for cheaper than what it would be to get it tested. I will be consuming it eventually, I know there's no way to homogenize powders without fancy equipment but I spent like 10 minutes shaking the powder in a loose bag, I will also repeat this process right before ingestion.

Maybe try doing an amount of the mix that, if the maximum possible dose of moxy that could be in there equals a dose of moxy that you would definitely feel, say, 5mg, and then if it feels about like that strong or stronger, you'll know it's in there.  Then again, what is the dose of 5-MeO-DALT you'd normally use?  You'd also have to take into account the strength of the accompanying 5-MeO-DALT, so you'd need to do a lower dose to account for possible potentiation.  But it seems to me that with some math you should be able to find a dose you could feel safe about taking and that would easily tell you if there was moxy present.

Ah dang. I personally enjoyed both of those compounds smoked, though I'm not sure how they would hold up together, especially in such ratios. Smoking the mixture could prevent any potential 5-MeO-MiPT hotspots from having devastating effects though, since you require a much larger dose of it smoked than you would orally.

Actually vaping would be the safest way as the dose for vaped moxy is 2x the oral dose which is why I experimented yesterday with vaping the "mystery" mixture, my results were pretty inconclusive as I had taken 6-apb and a small dose of 25D the day before. Anyways I started with 5mg doses and worked up to 20mgs, from what it felt like there was no moxy but I can only say thay by the lack of visual activity and euphoria... besides that they share that same body buzz although the body buzz was more on the uncomfortable side and felt exactly like plain -DALT. 


I'm gonna wait for tolerance to psychs to drop and try some more vaping doses before I give it a shot orally. Next week or two I'll vape 20mgs in one shot and compare it to the 20mgs I took when first recieving the -DALT and if there's any visual activity I'm gonna go out and say there may be some -MIPT in there as -DALT has produced zero visuals at all for me at any vaped dose yet -MIPT was very visual. I would just buy another gram of -DALT but all experiences were shitty (plugged, vaped, and insufflated), just thought I would give it one oral shot before calling this one a dud.


Edit: Sorry e's, I mis-read your post. You are correct that smoking would be the safest way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Notes on 5-MeO-DALT**


The compound I'm dealing with is white almost chalky 5-MeO-DALT from a very reliable vendor. I am coming off 200mg/day Zoloft — It's still in my system. I did not notice anything alarming regarding blood pressure or heart rate in any dose or ROA mentioned below. Neither did my SSRI-naive friends. Vasoconstriction is definitely present via all ROAs but it was not an issue with me nor my peers.


**INSUFFLATION**

The drug burns insufflated. I managed to stuff ~15mg up my nose and got a slight buzz. Nothing remarkable. A friend insufflated the same amount with similar results. I deem insufflation an ineffective ROA.


**ORAL**

Same friend and I parachuted 25-30mg 5-MeO-DALT with no remarkable effects. We felt good, a slight psychedelic headspace but nothing to write home about.


**Vaporization / Smoking**

Same friend and I hopped into my monster truck and drove to get a freebase pipe (meth pipe, glass stem with a bowl at the end. Google Images will show you what I'm talking about.)


An unmeasured amount of 5-MeO-DALT was stuffed into the freebase pipe and a propane torch was lit. Friend and I vaporized a good amount of the substance with interesting effects. I suppose some of the 5-MeO-DALT combusted but the majority was vaporized. The first few tokes taste like plastic but it numbs your mouth and further tokes are smooth.


Anyway, the effects include a psychedelic headspace, calming sedation and a "reset" of the senses. Colors are vibrant, etc. Again, nothing remarkable about the substance but it's a very nice buzz with some empathy and closed eye visuals. No open eyed visual distortions. The drug is similar to 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-MiPT but it lacks most of the sexual arousal of the latter substance in my experience, except when vaping A LOT. But this arousal doesn't last long. Meaning, you'll feel aroused, but that feeling will subside before you get to the club, or one of your girl/boyfriends arrives.


It's an interesting substance and I have maybe 700mg left to play around with. Perhaps a huge oral dose would really show me what the substance is all about but I don't find 5-MeO-DALT to be a substitute for Foxy Methoxy/MiPT. I myself am not a huge fan of 5-MeO-DMT.


I'm new to smoking tryptamines (minus N,N-DMT) but with so many RCs in the market, I don't see a place for this in my stash except as a collector's item.


I will be experimenting with 4-AcO-DMT in a few hours.

I have been experimenting with 5-MeO-DALT for the last 5/6 months. I have tried various ROA's: oral, insufflation (both with powder and solution), smoking in cigarettes and chasing on foil. I have used various doses at around Shulgin's recommendations as well as doses slightly above it, and doses that I will not post here for the sake of HR, in terms of lurkers who will take my stupid doses as a recommendation. I have used 5-MeO-DALT on its own as well as in combos with several drugs of various classes.


I DO NOT recommend insufflation for this chemical, at all. It has the worst burn I've ever felt, complete with corrosion of nasal passages at tiny doses, even when waterlined. If that's not enough to deter you: it is also completely ineffective. 


Oral: my preferred ROA, incredibly rapid come-up, as others have mentioned. Within 15 minutes, stomach contents irrelevant, you are rocketing upwards at such a rate it can be uncomfortable and worrisome if unprepared. However, once the come-up is over, you feel as you would expect. 


Smoking/vaping: Added to a cigarette does have effects, even as HCL it is easily vapable. Better effects are felt when vaped off foil; very rapidly becomes an amber oil which provides masses of harsh, acrid, smoke tasting of burned plastic and urine. The entire show lasts <10 minutes and isn't entirety enjoyable. There is a fleeting psychedelic headspace: in-depth analysis of all thoughts, dissection of consciousness and a great appreciation of visual stimuli which takes on a sort of rounded, plastic like appearance - like those fake plants you sometimes see. However, this is quickly overshadowed by a feeling of 'not quite right', before typical Tryptamine effects are felt on the GI tract. Smoking also provides a worryingly high HR - within realms of Tachycardia. Overall: not worth it.


Surprisingly, I find oral admin without standard GI distress from Trypts.


At low doses: a desire to communicate is felt, nature appears beautiful, colours seem brighter but the edges seem dull and rounded. There is intense tactile euphoria, stroking hair feels wonderful! Dependent upon dose, the visuals can be minor distortions to full-on fractal explosions, visual tracers, still images begin warping into visual animations, everything becomes slow-motion. Intense (!) nystagmus is present making concentration very difficult. It is rather hilarious trying to read when peaking, words change colour every few seconds before melting into goo and dribbling away.  There is a decent amount of music appreciation - at high doses it can be overwhelming, it ranges from unconscious dancing to Dance/Trance/Techno/EDM to singing along, loudly and carelessly, to emotionally charged (or cheesy and soppy, depending on your view ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) ) songs. However, my one bad experience was when a friend began playing Black Metal as I was peaking (Dimmu Borgir - The Serpentine Offering, for anyone interested), my visual field became swirls of purple and black, along with a sense of complete awe mixed with abject terror. A strange mix, I assure you.

At high doses there is incredible empathy (along the lines of MDMA, and that is not an exaggeration), the sheer euphoria from just thinking of someone you care about is incredible - I almost teared up just watching a couple kissing... ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


At *stupid* doses and when mixed with some other drugs (alcohol, MPA and 5-EAPB are good combinations at low doses) 5-MeO-DALT becomes an entirely different animal. Incredible gurning (worse than MDMA by far - I had to stand in front of a mirror for 15 minutes trying to remember where my jaw was supposed to be!), nystagmus is ridiculously prominent at the peak, pupil dilation is just obscene. 


I have had experiences ranging from mild, brighter colours and a bit giggly to full blown tripping alongside an *almost* 'rolling' feeling.

The dose-response curve is insane, and I feel the bad reviews come from people taking 12-20mgs an expecting something intense. However, it could be that the stuff on the market is impure and that Shulgin's doses would be sufficient for a pure sample.


If anyone has questions, ask away!

Did tokes of approximately 10mg (hard to tell. I measured ca. 15-20mg and put it on foil, but it wasn't easy to smoke at once as a matter of technique. Light bulb would be better, anyways). Awesome drug. Perfect body buzz, orgasmic waves vibrating through the cells, followed by peaceful calmness. Music feels perfect. Peak was ca. 5 minutes followed by a 15 minute comedown. Baseline reached after ca. 1-2 hours. Maybe longer, cleaned my room, cause I couldn't stand it while high. 

No CEVs, trees became freaking fractals, love 'em. 

With 5-MEO-DMT I felt extreme nausea, when smoking low doses, but with 5-MEO-DALT I haven't seen those rainbows coming out off my mouth. It was a bit of a stoner. Taste is like lovely plastic, as the experience. No profound activity, pure f*ck!ng hedonism ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Has anyone ever experienced heart burn from this substance. Tired about 15mg on friday and since then i have had constant heart burn and even omeprazole doesn't seem to help much. Im thinking maybe the bomb could have opened before it reached my stomach and possibly burnt my oesophagus? It was from a reputable source and all the effects where just as i expected so I'm pretty sure it is 5MeO-DALT. Iv got a Dr appointment in 2 days just incase its something else but any information or similar experiences would be much appreciated.

well my first experience with 5-meo-dalt was actually extremely lsdesque - and i'd dropped 40mg along with a friend in the park. lasted 2 hours, we dropped another. would have kept dropping over and over frankly if we had more pellets so i can see an addictive side to this stuff.


also noticed 0 diminishing returns with it too. bizarre substance. has been a big let down for me lately though, not sure if vendor to blame, or my tolerance.

hm, omeprazole is the right way forward. 40mg/day should be fine. you may also try adding a few oral antiacids and avoid other causes of hearburn.


personally ive eaten (too) many substances and not all were in foil. havent had one erode the oesophagus, though the worst offenrer was ah7921..

tryptamines may taste like shit but are rarely what you might call agressive to mucosa, and the dose you took was small enough.... u sure it wasnt something else?

Thanks for the reply. The Dr gave me more omeprazole and the heart burn went away a few days after. Still dont know if 5-Meo-DALT caused that but it was the worst heartburn i have ever experienced! lasted about a week or so if i remember right and it left me feeling like i had a throat infection but lower down in my oesophagus. As i said though the omeprazole did the job. I ended up flushing the rest because the subtle effects weren't worth the possible health complications for me.

Hmm... forgot about this thread. For anyone wondering if I tasted the potential moxy/5-meo-dalt mixture (highly doubt it), I did and I'm quite sure there is no moxy in it and I must've ingested a ton of moxy when blacked out, whatever you live and you learn. 


Anyways, I've tried it via all ROA's excluding IV/IM and still haven't found a use for it. It's kinda pleasant for a little while when plugged and slightly less when eaten but overall it hardly even feels like a psychedelic IME. Reminds me of cannabis and low dose dxm...in a way at least. It's very stoning...


The major downisides for me were that it causes quite a bit of tachycardia and chest/throat tightness, muscle tension, and a neutral feeling body buzz. By "neutral" I mean that it's not unpleasant but it's also not necessarily pleasant... likely because it was stimulating and I don't care for stims. Oh well, the only 5-meo I liked was 5-meo-mipt so I'm not surprised. Like most, I'm still puzzled by shulgins experiences with this stuff and at such low doses. I need at least 30-40mgs of this stuff for a plus one.

Poor adjective, replace stoning with buzzy if you wanna get nit-picky... though in all honesty was a bit of both. Stimmy but not so much that it's impossible to relax.

It seems a lot of you are doing it wrong & missing the point with  this, expecting effects that aren't there & missing the fact this is an amazing functional psychedelic - it has a single specific function, sex. It wont get you really high or give any interesting visuals, it  could be dangerous to try higher doses or smoking it looking for that  & you wont really get much from this.


At around 20mg oral, on  top of a moderate dose of a proper psychedelic/stimulant, I've tried it with bk-2c-b,  probably a low to moderate dose of 2CB or MDMA would work too, it's the ideal sex drug. If you  don't have a sexual partner there doesn't seem to be much point in doing  this drug. If you do, it's possibly the greatest drug ever.


The  powder I got was pure white & sparkly, it's a fine powder, but seems to clump slightly & it sparkles under light. It's quite dense & clumps together easily, so please make sure you measure your doses. Effects of the substance I got seem to be as most  people describe them. I had 2 doses at around 20mg each (measured, but  bad scales), once before bk-2c-b & once when I'd plateaued from a  moderate 120mg bk-2c-b dose. Little or no visuals (slight fishbowl effect), little euphoria,  pleasant body feeling (may turn bad at higher doses), a clear slightly  psychedelic head, almost like a powerful nootropic, so the first dose seemed pretty pointless, maybe a bit more powerful than a heroic dose of noopept. Hours later, when it had totally worn off & I'd plateaued off the bk-2c-b my second 20mg dose of 5-meo-dalt seemed to reduce  or even totally remove the light visuals I was getting from the bk-2c-b,  gave me a much clearer head & pretty much made me feel like  superman, amazing sexual effects, everything you could ask for if you want a few hours of hard sex. Re-dosing & tolerance don't seem to be a problem, so you can keep the effects going for longer.


It's an amazing drug if you do it properly, use a small  dose in combination with something else & have sex, but it'll be  disappointing if you're looking for typical psychedelic effects, they're  not there.


You have to understand Shulgin was a bit of an old hippy & looking for the ideal sex drug, he seems to have found it.


It also seems to combine well with standard doses of noopept & ginkgo, gingko may help with any vasoconstriction. Cannabis works well with it too. This is just a drug for wild drug fuelled sex.

Tried again at 50mg (oral), on a light (50mg) bk-2c-b trip, just to test if there's anything good at higher doses, my result was negative. Around 20mg seems perfect.


At 50mg it still killed visual effects from the bk-2c-b, but the body load was too much, it brought my back pain on again pretty bad. I felt tired, in pain & uncoordinated. My mind was confused too, it wasn't good at all. Body load was worse than a heavy dose of mushrooms, more painful for me & my head felt a bit confused like I'd had a light dose of mushrooms, but without any kind of visuals or euphoria. No particular sexual energy effects at this higher dose either.


120mg bk-2c-b & 20mg 5-meo-dalt taken when the bk-2c-b has plateaued seems ideal for me. I certainly wont try higher doses, I don't know how I'd manage the body load on 100mg+, it sounds a stupid idea to me. It's pleasant at lower doses & just gets unpleasant at higher doses. It's slightly stimmy at about 20mg, but the body load drags it down too much at 50mg.


I regularly supplement with noopept & I'm recovering from chronic joint pain, so that may have affected the experience, but I wasn't in any pain immediately before I took the 5-meo-dalt.

So is a vapourised dose roughly the same as an oral dose? What would people recommend to start with, for vaping?

Vaping this compound should be about 15-20mg max. This should deliver a strong tryptamine rush and psychedelic effects lasting for about ten minutes. You would be feeling very **Tranced** for the duration. Music is pretty good. The taste can be abominable so try to get one or two good lungfuls without needing to reheat the 5-MeO-DALT. I have never tried an oral dose.

Interesting. Think I'll try 20mg~ oral first, then give the vaping a blast... maybe when I take mushrooms. Cheers for the info.

It works pretty well like that, I love it. Sometimes I don't want to be hallucinating too much, want to be back to baseline in under 2 hours & just want some nice psychedelic euphoria. It's pretty awesome, like mdma-lite, shorter duration, lower intensity & none of the side effects.


It's properly amazing for sex too, or even a wank.


Better eat it up before it's illegal, today is 5-meo-dalt day for me, been vaping it half of the day & just swalled half a 40mg pill - the smallest half.


E-cig vaping it works well too for a 10 minute rush & I like the taste, but I'm weird. It's much more potent vaped, I'd guess about 4x stronger effects than oral, but not lasting as long.

I was having 10-20mg oral boosters & e-cig vaped boosters along with several drugs (ethylphenidate, bk-2c-b, cannabis, alcohol, cocaine), always seems to produce a warm euphoria, energy & mushroom-like body high without too much visuals, horny too. It was only at 50mg oral (in a single dose, on bk-2c-b comedown) when I got some bad feeling body load. It was best with cannabis and/or bk-2c-b. With bk-2c-b it dampend the visuals & gave me the horn.

This thread has reminded me I got a stash of this stuff from 2 years ago, would it be any good after that long? might give it a little try this weekend.


The last time I tried it I combined it with mdma and thought I was gonna die.

Still low doses, weed & 5-meo-dalt can make my heart race a bit. Quarter that low dose if you're smoking or vaping the 5-meo-dalt. I wouldn't take it at exactly the same time as another drug either, better to wait until the main course has reached it's peak & then add a little 5-meo-dalt if it feels safe to do so, even oral doses of 5-meo-dalt tend to work quickly.


One combo I forgot about that went wrong was with 5f-akb48 & nicotine, don't do that, but just stay away from 5f-akb48 & other synthetic cannabinoids in general.

So I experimented with 5-meo-dalt the other night.


I'd had a few drinks/etizolam with friends, and allowed the alcohol to wear off slightly before using.


We used a bong and lots of ash to carefully vapourise the 5-meo-dalt and my friend tried 10 mg with zero effects.


Eventually he got a hit out of it at 17 mg, so that's what I tried.


The effects were, I guess, similar to a psychedelic MDMA of some sort. I sat down and closed my eyes for the entirety of the trip. I seem to remember being very fucked and kind of focusing on the music. My friend Tom received similar effects.


The next time I tried 20 mg and received less of an effect. Music sounded cool, though not as cool as I hoped for. Either the smoking method was inconsistent (undoubtable, really) or tolerance builds fast. After the initial effects we were left with a cool sort of hedonistic feeling. Almost like a very, very mild candyflip.


My friend smoked 25 mg the next time, and received little effect.


So he decided that he wanted to smoke 50 mg [**!!Please do NOT do this!!**]. I talked him out of it and he settled for 35 mg. This was still too high. He became very confused and his eyes darted around the room whilst he repeatedly asked us 'what was going on'. My friend tried to talk him out of it and reassure him for five minutes to no avail. My other friend went quiet and then, again, asked us to tell him what was going on so I intervened and said 'right, basically you've taken a drug. It's called 5-meo-dalt. In five minutes it will ware off and everything will be normal. You are okay'.


A wave of realisation swept over his face and you could see the relief wash over him. He suddenly started talking normally and ecstatically as if nothing was wrong. This dose is far too high, although I do think my friend had trouble riding the experience out each time he smoked. He would have his eyes open trying to make sense of things repeatedly asking "what's this drug called again" and inevitably seeming very confused each time I uttered the words 5-meo-dalt (he know's what 5-meo-dalt is, but I guess it still sounds like a confusing jumbled mess when you're actually on the stuff).


To sum things up, I'd say a vapourised dose is 15-20 mg~, as per p-helix recommendation on the previous page. Tolerance builds fast and you need to make sure you smoke it all.


Now that I know it's active I will probably try about 40mg orally.

Lower doses are better, then you just tend to get the euphoria without the weirdness & problems, it's active at 1-5mg vaped. Oral doses are 15-30mg & last longer than vaping, up to about 2 hours.

Thanks for the detailed report, it can get quite scary at high doses as I found out the hard way eyeballing a dose whilst high on mdma which was too high and it was horrible, cold sweats, walls melting, struggling to speak. I was on my own too so made it worse, I just about managed to phone my mate to come down in case I passed out or done something stupid, I could hardly get my words out. by the time he arrived it had calmed down and I was feeling ok. I've not touched it since lol

40mg is a strong dose, getting close to weird/uncomfortable territory, for me. I had some 40mg pills & took them in halves. Different people may react differently, I'm pretty light & not the fittest young thing around, but I'd start with the Shulgin recommended 12–20 mg, orally.


For me 50mg oral gave me a weird bodyload, felt very heavy like I was carrying a load of extra weight, gave me joint pain, cold sweats & made people's faces warp/melt, wasn't terrible, just not much fun, was definitely weird, I wouldn't take that dose again & definitely wouldn't try more, I'd stick to max 30mg unless tolerance was a problem. 20mg is a nice light euphoria & warm comforting body high without any visuals or much headfuck, like vapourising about 5mg, but longer lasting. I'd rather have a low dose & mix it with a low dose of something else. I'm not sure if you were wasting some when you smoked/vaped it, maybe you were burning some off in the bong or some got dissolved in the water, but 10mg vaped should be very strong, maybe get a crack pipe or an e-cig to vape it without burning it.


It's not a chem you can eyeball, you need milligram scales, it's active at low doses & higher doses get unpleasant. The stuff I got was a little clumpy too, so it'd be impossible to eyeball 20mg.


Oral doses usually seem to start working after about 10-15 minutes & then last about 2 hours. Can redose once or twice without much tolerance problem, although you may get a tolerance from using it regularly.


It's not a very visual tryptamine, I think to get much visuals you'd have to go past the euphoric stage & well into weird bodyload territory.


BTW, it dissolves OK in PG & vapes in an e-cig. Around 25-35mg per ml seems to work nicely.

I tried it orally. One friend had work so just smoked a bit, and was able to relay what happened. He weighed out the doses but can't remember how much he gave us. I told him 30 mg was a dose though.


Basically, I was a bit drunk and had taken etizolam, as had everyone else. I don't remember anything except dancing for a bit. I assumed it hadn't worked.


Apparently, me and my two mates who were on the oral dose got stuck in a loop. I'd say I wanted to listen to psy-trance, and then my friend would say she wanted to listen to a tune they'd been working on. Then they'd realise they couldn't because it was an ableton project and wasn't finished. Then my mate would try to find it and remember it wasn't finished so he couldn't play it. Then I'd say just put psy-trance on, then my friend would suggest putting their tune on. Then my mate would try to find it on his computer... etc etc.


You get the picture. I'd have taken less if I'd seen your post. If you ask me we should have just left the set I put on, on and things would have been okay. I seem to remember enjoying myself.


I can't stand it when people interrupt to play individual tunes. Especially when they're fucking ableton projects!


But yeah, it was strange and confusing. It would have probably been uncomfortable if not for the etizolam, of which I took too much.

I have tried this chemical many times now. It is really interesting and enjoyable. I have mostly smoked it but have done orally a couple times, and have plugged it a number of times also. Smoking then plugging being my favorites, not necessarily in that order. Each has it's own merits. 


The most notable thing is the euphoria when smoked. It is really intense and enjoyable. It doesn't last very long at all, however. This chem can be dosed repeatedly via smoking with seemingly no build in tolerance (or at least not much) but there might be cross-tolerance with other tryptamines. I can't really tell you exact dosages because it has been all eyeballed (bad idea I know, but I started really low and very slowly edge my way up). 


One time I smoked 'too much' and actually started to trip! It was really fun though to be honest. I freaked out at first because I'm thinking "Shit! I don't know how safe this is, I'm tripping balls, this could be it, I've only read about like one other person who has tripped on this." After the initial panic though I really enjoyed it. I am trying to carefully push myself back up to that dose, and have gotten close a couple times, on the cusp of tripping but not quite there yet, just a lot of distortion and some melting (as apposed to seeing cartoony faces and some patterns and random shit). 


This shit is damn near therapeutic. Almost like crack but the euphoria hits right away and falls immediately afterwords, rather then building at all, and doesn't last as long. It doesn't seem to be that bad for the body though. Heart rate seems to go up a little for me but nothing serious, there is a feeling like my heart is beating hard but I bet that is from vasoconstriction or something similar as when I tested my heart rate during one of those times it was something like 70bpm (my resting hear rate is in the high 50s). 


Like some other people have said it does feel similar to mdma, but in more of a tryptamine way. It's like if molly was more of a tryptamine first, with the euphoria following in the wake of the tryptamine action. Not quite as intense though, although it damn near feels as good. It is sort of less of a physical euphoria, where as your body feels more tryptamine like, and slightly energetic, yet relaxed. 


Strange stuff but I really like it.

Never had a great time with tryptamines, though I haven't tried a huge range. When I obtained 5-meo-dalt about a year ago (still have most of it left and rarely touch it), it would add a light buzz smoking it with friends after a night at the bar or something, but doing it alone I kind of get fuzzy and then just want to sleep. I've tried a pretty big range of dosages, I smoke it off of foil leaving enough distance from the flame to just vaporize rather than burn it. I want to have these dancey happy feelings other people get, but it's never worked that way for me.


I'm not on SSRIs but I am on Wellbutrin and a couple of other "trip-killers," aka a light dose of benzos, not necessarily every day. Might be an issue? I don't know enough about the chemistry of the substance, all I know is it's never gotten me to the point of loving the shit out of music, feeling lovey with friends, etc., and definitely never gotten even close to an MDMA vibe. I also seem to get a heavier body load than what most people have described here. A feeling of general physical unease, tenseness or pain in my neck, spine, back muscles, etc.

Went back and tried it a different night, just smoking it off foil (which I don't really like to do but works in a pinch). Body load still there, but I got some mild OEVs, wavering lines and warping of text, and an enhanced enjoyment of music. Still not my favorite thing but it's nice to see the potential.

Since Shulgin invented 5-meo-DALT, I've always trusted it.

It was really nice to take - 4 hours of trippy feeling then gone.

It was also a great sex drug - surprisingly.

So what happened - did it get banned? I can't find any.

I thought it was gone but lately I've seen it pop up here and there. 


It used to be my go-to substance for a pleasant, but mild and short experience, like a psychedelic snack of sorts (sorry if that sounds sacrilegious) but over time it lost that position to 2C-D.


I haven't touched it in over a year; earlier today I took ~35mg (orally in a gelcap) to test its activity but I hardly felt any effects at all. Seems like it doesn't last for eternity. Now I kind of miss it, time to restock.

This one is so strange, I'm pretty sure Kaleida wrote a report about base DALT (not the 5-MeO), and definitely tripped.  But unlike every single other tryptamine family I can think of, in this case the 5-MeO seems to make it LESS potent rather than more.


I never found this one interesting-sounding so I never bothered to get any.  On the other hand, 5-MeO-MALT sounds like a good one.

Personnally, 80mg oral was wonderfull. Nice glowing experiences, not too long duration, easy comedowns.


But, I tried 110mg nasally one time, and it was too much. I puked and felt bad for a couple of hours.

Are you sure you're not thinking of 4-AcO-DALT? I wrote a few reports on that, but I haven't actually managed to get more than a high out of DALT yet. It does definitely feel like there's something to it though, though it may require a high dosage.... I only have a small amount of it left to work with and will probably end up smoking it like the other base tryptamines. I have heard of at least one or two accounts of typical geometric visuals and such when used by this route of administration.


I'm still optimistic about 5-MeO-DALT personally, other than the possibility of body load which for this class can be kind of harsh for me. 10 mg didn't do much for me as a tester dose, but it does seem to have significantly reduced potency from most 5-MeO tryptamines as you say. In particular, I'm really excited about it now due to the fact that among the 4-substituted and possibly also the base tryptamines for me so far it seems that the DALT tail shares some of the more unique qualities of the DPT and EPT tails that separates them from the more classically DMT-like tails, which is a style I'm really coming to enjoy as of late and as I understand it is more mescaline-like than the typical indole (and it definitely applies somewhat to my 2C-C experience), and that's notable to me since 5-MeO-DPT appears to possibly be a dud due to physical toxicity from the scarce reports at doses that are far lower than would seemingly be required to produce effects alike a full dose of 5-MeO-DALT, which is apparently not unlike 5-MeO-DET, so 5-MeO-EPT while being a total unknown right now could be similarly bad too. On the other hand, 5-MeO-DALT seems remarkably safe by comparison, for whatever reason.... On top of all that, I'm also particularly drawn to it now given that I seem to have an uncommonly strong hallucinogenic response to 5-MeO tryptamines based on my experiences on 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-EiPT so far, so I'm hopeful that with a high but still reasonable dosage and some good cannabis and nitrous I'll be able to fairly easily enjoy a full-spectrum psychedelic effect out of it to make the most of these properties with. But, we shall see.... I'll probably come back to this in the near future, but maybe not before trying 5-MeO-MiPT again first.


5-MeO-MALT sounds great too, I'm really sad that I didn't get it when it was around in retrospect now having tried 4-AcO-MALT and MALT. It's been a pretty fascinating class for me so far.... Very sexy and strong but also subtle and mysterious. I really hope someone brings it back around some time.

I've got a night in, and am feeling experimental.  And then I realized I have some of this.  I'm thinking about 25-30mg orally.  Anyone have experience or opinions?  I read through much of this thread and reports seem mixed.  I am anticipating a slightly trippy, euphoric experience, with little to no depth.

This one is best Vaped from what i remember back when I'd been using it years ago. Would use like 20-35mgs depending on my tolerance and layer it into a bowl of Cannabis like you would DMT. Was very Euphoric and Tactile it was actually a favorite of mine for awhile. When taking it orally id dose between 80-100mgs and that was roughly the same strength as the Vaped dose for me just lasted 4-5 hours.


I'd prefer it that way when i had alot, once had a mindblowing empathogenic experience combining it with 4-MMC both oral doses like maybe 100mgs of 5-MeO-DALT and 250mgs of 4-MMC or something close to it. Was literally once of the best drug experiences of that sort I've ever had of that sort. It was basically like an Orgasm that lasted for hours only way to describe it.

I had about 45mg in total, 30 + 15 an hour in.  It was weird, I felt very mildly good, it was pleasant and lightly pleasurable but absolutely no headspace and it wasn't euphoric other than physically I felt nice.  Then I smoked some weed and also got a call for a work thing that was totally unexpected (and after hours) and I found it kind of hectic, I just felt very scattered and it was stressful completing my task.  I think I probably didn't dose high enough, but I didn't find it particularly great or worthwhile.  I took some notes but didn't feel like actually writing a TR afterwards.

I tested this one before it got outlawed. Orally was nauseating with overall little payoff, vaped it tasted like plastic. Rectal was the way to go, yet again. Had some nausea, but not to any significant degree with a little herb on top. I liked the duration as well, not many substances are over the peak in two hours, and pretty much completely gone by four. Fun to binge some fruit on it as well.


Low doses were best, 10mg to 20mg, sometimes even just 5mg. 30mg just didn't really add anything more but increased heart load, which became a bother with daily use. Very useful to rehumanize oneself after a day on dissociatives.

5Meo-DALT is a lot more potent than DALT; 150mg of the latter is extremely mild (maybe equal to 15-20mg of the 5 sub) and not much cop. I have only been up to 60 or so mg of 5MeO-DALT and it's very nice - certainly could go higher if I still had it since no problems what so ever. 5MeO-MALT I hated > vaped it induced movement but worrying tachycardia and was pleased when it subsided. 4AcO-DALT was really nice but again not very potent

I was looking through my notes today and saw that I took notes on a trial of this, my first time tasting it.  It wasn't anything special or even a full dose I don't think, but I thought I'd post it anyway.  I'm going to do a couple of more trials and then publish a full write-up of this compound.


**First trial of 5-MeO-DALT - 31mg + 14mg orally**

November 14th, 2019

by Xorkoth​

**6:07pm*** (T+0:00)* - Ingested 31mg orally.  The drug appears as an unremarkable, chalky white powder.  The taste is bitter and reminiscent of other tryptamines.  However it's odd because at first it didn't taste very bitter, it's a "slow burn" sort of bitter.  And when I rinsed my mouth out with water, it got **more** bitter which is strange.  It's lingering on fairly strongly, but it doesn't bother mer.  I'm going to go ahead and eat a spoon of peanut butter though, as that is my cure-all for lingering tastes.  About to run to the store, I'm hoping it starts to come up while I'm out.  I will be spending the rest of the night at home.  I had a small sip of propylhexedrine as a focus aid a few hours ago but it was just enough for a bit of energy and isn't really registering with me as being high (probably like 10mg of it if I had to guess).


**6:12pm*** (T+0:05)* - My tongue is numb now where the powder was on it, not totally numb, but notably so.


**6:45pm*** (T+0:38 )* - Redosed 14mg, for a total of 45mg.  About 20 minutes ago I felt the come-up begin.  A very smooth and pleasant feeling buzz, warm, pleasurable, but quite mild.  h\Hence the redose, though the first dose probably hasn't finished coming up yet.  So far there is nothing remarkable about this.  No visual distortions at all, no real headspace either.


**7:10pm*** (T+1:03)* - Feeling rather mentally scattered.  Physically I feel nice, but I wouldn't say I feel euphoric.  This stuff seems rather uninteresting, really.  I'm gonna smoke a little weed, maybe that will liven things up.


**7:15pm*** (T+1:08 )* - Now I'm feeling a little psychedelic.  Just saw a work email which made me feel a little anxious, timing for something moved a day earlier than I expected.  Should I be finishing this build now, rather than in the morning? 


**7:50pm*** (T+1:43)* - Okay I'm doing this.  It's kinda fun, programming.  Some wacky tinnitus.  Took 1000mg carisoprodol.


**8:35pm***(T+2:28 )* - Just finished making dinner, AND the work stuff.  Eating is sublime.  The Somas kicked in and I feel amazing right now.


**Notes from afterwards**​

This dose was pretty unremarkable.  Smoking weed did kick in the psychedelic nature of it a little bit, before then it felt almost kind of annoying, not unpleasant but I felt scatterbrained and a bit off.  After smoking a hit of weed, I felt a little anxious (though weed tends to produce anxiety very easily for me these days), but the headspace also developed a bit and so did the body high.  Physically I felt relatively good, nothing spectacular by any means, but nice.  Mentally I was having a hard time keeping my train of thought steady, and I got a work email suddenly even though it was after work hours.  I could have saved it until the morning but I decided to go ahead and tackle the task.  In the process I became more confident feeling and by the end of it I felt rather good, but it was still pretty uneventful.  As I was hoping for a bit more euphoria, I went ahead and took some Somas (carisoprodol), 1000mg in total.  Once those kicked in I had a better than usual Soma high, I really felt very good and spent the rest of the evening grinning and hanging out, and slept fine later on.  I certainly consider this dose to be an underdose.  With the remainder, I have plenty to dose sinstantially higher orally, and also to experiment with vaporization which I think may be the way to go judging from other reports.

I smoked 10mg (pretty drunk at the time though) and it was quite intense for like 5-10 minutes. 


Strong bodyhigh, kinda like the rush that I get from 5-MeO-DMT, but not as strong, kinda pleasant physically but I expected more from reading reports. Quite visual and the instant switch in headspace gave me some anxiety but despite the alcohol it was quite introspective. I should try smoking 5-MeO-MiPT sometime.

I tried to smoke about 15 mg's last night, I think I burned the majority, should've sandwhiched better. That plasticky taste I remember from 5-meo-dmt is infinitely worse with 5-meo-dalt, very sharp and acrid, lingers longer too. I didn't feel much of anything, expected a sudden onset and racing heart, but nothing of the sorts. Just slightly more mental acuity after about 10-20 seconds, bit of a bodyhigh, but it was definitely treshold. Too bad it's so horrible tasting, I might just do a dosage orally next time because of it, I still have a bit anyways.

For me and the couple of other people who tried it when I had it, smoking it on its own gave effects very similar to cannabis although slightly more psychedelic. Little visual activity, surfaces would appear to get a glossy coating. Comfortable body buzz. Doses tried ranged from 10-30 mg, with 30 mg producing no real increase in psychedelia than lower doses.


30 mgs rolled into a joint shared between three people while peaking on 2C-D however was something else entirely. Kicked a pretty mellow trip into high gear. OEVs out of this world, changing extremely rapidly. Also strong physical rushing, a bit too much really. There was quite a bit of anxiety for me and one of my tripmates, bordering on what I'd call a bad trip but not tipping completely over.
