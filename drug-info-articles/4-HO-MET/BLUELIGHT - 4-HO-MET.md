Thought since I had such a long day, I'd kick back with a tom petty cd and enjoy a few nice kush joints. Any ideas of anything to lighten up the night? Good movies to watch, activities to do. I'm all alone too, so solo activities.

I you have never listened to Pink Floyd the Darkside of the Moon or Meddle. Smoke up, put in the cd close your eyes and you will have an outer body experience especially by the time you get to "on the run"


Then listen to Echoes on Meddle. If you can find the film Pink Floyd live at Pompei, it is an AWESOME experience. The Wall is also good but not as good as the others.

If you want ideas hit up the social or the "Fun Things To Do While High Thread" or "Favorite Media" or w/e its called.


Don't make new threads about what to do!
