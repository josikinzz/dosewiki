**Welcome to the Small & Handy 4-HO-McPT Thread!**


![34dpyr9.jpg](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fi67.tinypic.com%2F34dpyr9.jpg&hash=86c940cce63d29fe6b1e6592291cd5e3)


*4-hydroxy-N-methyl-N-cyclopropyltryptamine

*​

This novel tryptamine has recently become widely available to those who know where to find it. I am not yet aware of anyone having taken it and come back to report on the effects, but I do know that many are interested and I know of at least one person who is planning to soon, if they haven't already. I also will be contributing my own experience to it some point, when I work my way to it. For that reason, I have decided to start up this thread in anticipation of what is to come. However, before I wrap this up, please heed the following warning.


This is an entirely novel  psychedelic so I must urge caution to all  those out there who intend to  or are considering trying it for  themselves. Though so far the class of  chemicals it comes from appears  to produce fewer risky physical effects  than many others on average,  there is no way to tell how anyone will  react to an entirely new  molecule until they actually do it and find  out. Please, if you do plan  to take this chemical, know your sensitivity  to these kinds of  psychedelics first and start with reasonable doses  before working your  way up.


That said, in the case that you do take  4-HO-McPT, please consider  adding any important information about your  experience to this thread  as well, so that others will be more educated  about its effects and  safety. Due to the popularity of many closely  related chemicals to this  one and the recent outgrowth of tryptamines it  seems likely that many  people will be trying this one for themselves if  they get the chance,  so the more information we have about it really  will greatly benefit  everyone, especially since we're starting from  basically nothing.


Alright, let the information gathering begin!

I might decide to snag 100mg of this along with 100mg of 4-HO-EPT.


Any clue on what a good starting dose will be for 4-HO-McPT?

I really could not say with any amount of certainty, but the only McPT trip report I'm aware of found it to be active in a similar dosage range to MiPT, but more alike the straight chain alkyl tryptamines in effect than MiPT is if I'm not mistaken. This would make enough sense to me since the structure is basically the same minus the extra bond which holds the two end carbons on the tail a bit closer together, so I figure you'd expect it to bind pretty similarly. So, for 4-HO-McPT, personally if I had no other reference I would probably go into it treating it like it had similar doses to 4-HO-MiPT, but maybe with the precaution that it could be a little more powerful of a trip by weight.


That's probably the best advice I think I could give with my level of knowledge, but again, it's all just theory. Just try to be as safe as possible when you try it! I doubt that this particular class of chemicals has much inherent danger based on past experiences and what I've read about them, but you never know what's going to turn out to be dangerous for some unforeseen reason....

Really cool that you're sampling these novel tryptamines :D

Not sure if they were sold out in an instant but they were gone when I got there.. but i have a budget to stick to anyway..

Thanks for reporting on them, at least for starters with the 4-HO-EPT..

You're telling me, I've been pumped 24/7 since they showed up. :D It's a shame that they're already sold out though, I wonder if there's plans to get more or if it will now come down to those who already got some to see how they go....


But yeah, I was definitely just really lucky to notice them when I did. I was already aware of the source and their adventurousness and had been watching them like a hawk. I managed to get myself a pretty good personal supply of most of them too, I think I'm going to be pretty satisfied without even having to seek out anything else for some time now. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


And no problem! I'm glad to contribute my experiences and thoughts. 4-HO-EPT really has been a cool one for me so far too, it's got me even more excited for the others. I'll also be soon writing about MET, MPT, EPT, and DPT which I actually haven't tried yet.... After I've done that, I'll actually have tried every base or 4-hydroxy tryptamine with a tail using every combination of only methyls, ethyls, and propyls except for DET, which I unfortunately cannot get as a research chemical as it has been illegal here for a long time. I still hope to find it one day somehow, but until then it will haunt my dreams.... But, at least I'll have my otherwise completely full checklist to hold me over until then. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

*BUMP*


Has anyone tried this one yet? Still eagerly waitingon trip reports so we can figure out if it's worth getting or not. It's definitely high upon my wish list along with the other novel 4 subs. so if you've taken it post! Kaledia, are you planning to trip with this one soon? I know you recently did 4-ho-EPT but I think it's about time for some reports on this one! Pretty please!

I know, I really figured we would have seen something on it by now! However, the person I mentioned in the opening post who was considering trying it recently reached out to me and said they got sidetracked with life but were now planning it again soon, so that's at least one source of information coming up.


fractal fountain, I am planning to use it relatively soon one way or another, though I haven't quite picked a date. The reason I actually didn't plan to go with it right after 4-HO-EPT was just to give someone else a chance to try a new chemical first, but after a long enough time without any new information I'm definitely getting a little antsy. I was planning to smoke MET some time this weekend before work and then take a high oral dose of MiPT next weekend, but I haven't been feeling it as much as I thought I would be honestly. I still definitely am interested in MET too, but I think if Monday (my best full trip day) rolls around and I feel like doing something fuller and more long-lasting, I might take 4-HO-McPT instead. Decisions, decisions....


I've definitely got high hopes for it too though, for a substance with nothing written on it anyway. The propyl and isopropyl derivatives are already quite interesting and worthwhile, I don't see why the cyclopropyl wouldn't be too!

I've got quite an itchy trigger-finger on this one, too. The only thing stopping me is the speculation that the cyclopropyl group might represent the potential for cytotoxicity / DNA alkylation. However, bluelighter Erny appears to indicate [here](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/398906-MCPT-Inexperienced-interesting-Rare-Compound?p=6452170&viewfull=1#post6452170) that the metabolism of a tryptamine with a cyclopropyl substitution is unlikely to pose any risk (if I'm reading that correctly).


Regardless, my pharmacology knowledge is pretty much nonexistent, so can someone who knows what they're talking about chime in here?

Possibly sometime either this week or next I will be doing my first experiment with 4-HO-MCPT (I am the one Kaleida mentioned above). I will treat this one very carefully and will try report back with some information!

I can't pretend to know much about the DNA alkylation, but the fact that he and a couple others don't seem to worried about it is comforting. Still, something to keep in the back of the mind.... However, after reading through that I am now personally much more concerned about the fact that N-cyclopropyltryptamines apparently act as monoamine oxidase inhibitors. If 4-HO-McPT retains this activity as well then that could make it a good deal more dangerous than other 4-substituted tryptamines, possibly on its own but more seriously I think in combinations, as these chemicals are often used. It would probably be very wise for anyone reading this and considering trying this molecule to not combine it with anything at all that you would not take with an established MAOI....

So with talk of the cyclopropyl group messing up dna, my question is what would be the harmfull side effects accociated with it. Im sorry but it just beyond my relm of knowledge. 

Also if its a maoi potentiating chemical then would do you have to worry about besides medication interaction? I think foods also can mess with maois. 

And lastly if it is a maoi and you (godforbid) have a bad reaction what would happen? 

Thx all

Nugz

I unfortunately can't speak to what damage could be caused, but I would love for someone more knowledgeable to chime in. All I know about these alkylating agents from the brief searching I've done so far is that they are sometimes used to kill cancer cells.... So, I guess it's probably not going to outright kill you if they already give them to people regularly, but just because they're worth taking to cancer patients doesn't necessarily mean they'll be worth it to people without some terrible health issues to get rid of to balance it out either.


From my brief reading on the MAOI activity of N-cyclopropyltryptamines, it looks like they're reversible inhibitors like the harmala alkaloids. However, I'm not sure if they only are functionally like them or if they actually work by the same specific mechanism(s). If they are like the harmala alkaloids then the dietary restrictions might not really be a serious issue, as much as people talk about the diet being important I've never heard of someone having a bad reaction to foods from harmalas, and I've known people to eat very tyramine-rich foods while tripping on ayahuasca regularly. But, if the mechanism is different and somehow does not allow for whatever causes the harmalas to be safer, then it could still be potentially quite risky to eat those foods. It still shouldn't last beyond the duration of the drug itself though, unlike the older pharmaceutical MAOIs.


If you do have a bad reaction from the MAOI effects, what would happen depends entirely upon what causes the reaction, because it's not going to be the MAOI effects themselves but whatever has its metabolism prevented by them. To my understanding, the primary result of having too high tyramine combined with MAOIs is a hypertensive crisis, and if you are worried about it I would very much recommend looking up some lists of MAOI diets, they are quite common. With anything else, it's either going to be that the drug you mix it with is directly potentiated enough to cause an overdose and whatever typical symptoms it would bring along with that, or it's going to be that some neurochemical effects of the drug you mix it with are potentiated, such as preventing metabolism of the serotonin released by an empathogen and causing serotonin syndrome.


Basically, if you start having a negative monoamine oxidase inhibition-based reaction, you should probably get yourself to a hospital pretty quickly. However, if you actually plan it properly going in ahead of time, it's extremely easy to avoid such a reaction. MAOIs with even heavier dietary and drug restrictions have been used medicinally for a long time and are not considered to be particularly dangerous to anyone who just follows the rules of their use like with anything.

When I do test it I want to do it in the best way possible... so I'll make sure I quite hydrated days ahead and the day of, empty stomach for a least 4 hours before ingestion, have a well balanced meal early in the day (I'll avoid food with any MAOIs), supplements/vitamins, 8 hours of sleep, etc. I've just been in a weird spot recently with my personal life so that's why I've held back on doing it already, but I feel like I'm back in a good spot again so I'm giving myself the green light. I'll also have a close friend of mine trip sitting in case anything does go wrong, and if it does either he or myself will report back here as soon as possible with details in hopes of helping others who read this. I also have a small stash of benzos on hand that I only use for bad trips so I will keep that close as well (if mixing benzos with this is a bad idea please let me know).


The only thing that I am unsure of at the moment is the dosage. I have already done the allergy test and there was no problems. I'm just worried that I might take too much but at the same time I don't want to take too little (you can always take more but you can never take less). I won't redose because I feel that like a tolerance might be built and would screw up my results. I feel like 20mg might be a good starting point but I also want to hear what others might think.

In Tranylcypromine ("Parnate"), the cyclopropyl group does indeed lead to Irreversible MAO Inhibition. However, the cyclopropyl in that drug is sandwiched between the Phenyl and the amine (it's essentially just amphetamine with the ethyl and alpha-methyl groups fused into a cyclopropyl ring). With 4-HO-McPT, on the other hand, the cyclopropyl is only connected to the terminal amine, so maybe it could get dealkylated/deaminated without permanently gumming up the enzyme.


As for DNA damage - there is a number of prescription pharmaceuticals with cyclopropyl groups attached to them that would probably have been taken off the market already if they were carcinogenic in any significant way; Prazepam, for one, comes to mind. Since the average psychonaut probably isn't going to ingest more than one-hundred miligrams of 4-HO-McPT in a month, I kind of doubt you're exposing yourself to a major cancer risk with it either.

Oh this is out...that it might be similar potency to 4HO-MIPT 'might' be correct since 25mg MIPT was mild and 20mg of McPT was at the point where I thought it was more than placebo but wasn’t entirely sure. I agreed with the original report that 40mg of McPT is more like a dose but not with them likening it to MIPT in effect; it was very different

Sounds like you've got a great plan there, can't wait to hear how it all turns out! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Also, to my knowledge benzos are generally not unsafe to mix with MAOIs, but you should probably at least do a couple quick web searches for the one you intend to use specifically to make sure that still applies to it.


As for the dose.... First of all, I feel I should point out that you probably also shouldn't redose for another reason: it could be, for instance, that 4-HO-McPT is not a MAOI but just a regular substrate that is metabolized into a MAOI, which would mean that if you spaced out the doses the successive doses would actually be increasingly more potent by weight than the first one. This is obviously not a good way to collect solid information on a brand new substance, nor is it really that safe of a possibility to take too many risks with at this point. So, yeah, I definitely think you should stick with that logic for whatever reason and not redose for now.


For a single dose, my best guess would be that 20 mg probably won't be too out of control. I'd feel comfortable starting at 25 mg myself, as I probably will, but I wouldn't go over that much for now. I probably wouldn't go under 20 mg either or I feel I'd risk being underwhelmed, but that is just based on my personal experience with other members of this chemical class, whereas for example I know someone who goes out of their mind on 15 mg of 4-HO-MiPT, so they would obviously be better off starting with a different kind of dose.

However, the cyclopropyl in that drug is sandwiched between the Phenyl and the amine (it's essentially just amphetamine with the ethyl and alpha-methyl groups fused into a cyclopropyl ring). With 4-HO-McPT, on the other hand, the cyclopropyl is only connected to the terminal amine, so maybe it could get dealkylated/deaminated without permanently gumming up the enzyme.

I've been trying to do a little bit of reading on the monoamine oxidase inhibitory properties of cyclopropylamines when I can, and it does seem like there's some variance, and it makes me want to be more cautious that 4-HO-McPT could be an irreversible inhibitor as well. Though, notably, I did find one saying that NcPT and 7-MeO-NcPT successfully inhibited the metabolism of serotonin whereas 5-MeO-NcPT did not, so I wonder if the 4-HO substitution being on the same side of the ring will also disrupt activity there? It's worth noting as well that a few of these studies that ascribe irreversible inhibitory properties to some of these cyclopropyl molecules actually also say that the corresponding isopropyl versions are reversible inhibitors, so it may be worth considering that if there were going to be any serious issues we might have already noticed them with 4-HO-MiPT. Lots of things to consider....


Thanks for pointing out the prazepam too, I was really wondering what some of the supposed pharmaceuticals containing cyclopropyl groups might be. That definitely does give me some more confidence with it.

I agreed with the original report that 40mg of McPT is more like a dose but not with them likening it to MIPT in effect; it was very different

Come to think about it, Prazepam is actually one of the more obscure drugs containing a cyclopropyl group.


Buprenorphine and Naltrexone also have one, and they're arguably far more widely used.

As is Ciprofloxacin (a highly effective broad-spectrum antibiotic) - granted, that one can actually be toxic a.f., but this seems to be related to the fluoroquinolone skeleton itself, not the little cyclopropyl. Plus, we are talking about a substance where a normal daily dose for an adult is 1,000 miligrams.

Sure perhaps I’ll put my trip report up but for now I will quote a relevant passage:


"It is worth commenting on the comparison that has been drawn between this and MiPT (on Bluelight) but it wasn’t really like it from what I remember. 

MiPT was “ok”; very mild (which is where the clumsy simile may come in) with a duration of 6-8hrs. It had a sort of generic synthetic trpytamine type signature and low key head space. You might be able to use it as a museum dose type thing or as a mild social or thinking type thing but it didn’t offer much. I don't know what a higher would do, it didn't seem it would necessarily provide much more. It didn't have the sensory aspect that some find in a couple of the 5MeOs. 


Concluding, McPT is odd stuff‘ as is oft said of experimental chemicals.

It’s largely simply stoning with some visual component, and the stand out feature of this trip was the sudden in and out. It's brevity (orally) is unrivalled. (edit) it seemed to come on very suddenly and then evaporate, the most notable level of effect being little more than 20min.” 


Worth noting the total duration was about 2hrs so the the ideal that the cyclopropyl turned to an isopropyl seems wrong (also plausably supported by some other data I’m aware of); most of the tests conducted by others were by insufflation and not considered outstanding but one party insufflated a very large amount and found it a candyflossDMT type experience of worth. Sadly never tried 4HO-MIPT but the fact it seems quite good when MIPT is modest suggests 4HO-McPT could be worthwhile but what alteration the hydroxy adds I don’t know. Hope that helps

Interesting, so theoretically one could try blasting themselves pretty far out without worrying much about getting stuck somewhere unpleasant for too long?  With acid for instance if one blasts too far they might be in for riding out a nightmare for hours on end.  I'm sure the mindstate this produces is nothing like acid either, but the brevity makes me wonder if going above and beyond what one is comfortable with isn't such a worrisome idea?

Wouldn't the real risk be the potentiation of the effects?  I remember reading somewhere about MAOIs and substituted tryptamines, basically unless you have a death wish of the ego variety sort, that is unless you want to potentiate the effects to a possibly mind damaging level (not brain, the risk isn't physical it is psychological as the effects can be potentiated to falling into a dimensional abyss and losing your damn mind levels) or at least according to a thread I read on this topic, could probably dig it up if I had the time using Google.  Edit (sorry for the spacing of this post editing it messed it up cannot alter the spacing now): Misunderstood the person asking about a MAOI concern.  Just do not take these compounds while taking an MAOI.  They are not like DMT in that taking a MAOI is favorable, or even like taking some Rue with fungus if one is feeling like a jungle shaman.  Substituted tryptamines + MAOI = Danger, danger you must be a deranged lone ranger!


I once took 4-HO-MIPT while taking a MAOI herb daily for sometime.  It didn't cross my mind the herb would have an effect on the compound but I was so eager to try I didn't really care to give it a second thought lol, be careful with herbs and drugs.  I thought I was going to die.  I thought I was going to lose my mind.  I've never felt that scared, scared to death, on any other drug before and I have experienced ego death and delusions that I actually died physically on mushrooms.  One time I called 911 and told them I was dying (some cops showed up with an ambulance and my friend ended up taking me home a half hour later from the hospital, I was coming down by this point)  after my sitter had left caused I wigged so hard and stripped myself naked and he was unable to control me, I was running around the neighborhood into neighbors garages (ate one too many grams of what must have been specimens of an underestimated potency) and then I thought I was really dying after I went into trance for what seemed like an hour, totally out of body and having a waking dream, inexplicable stuff, shamanic trance describes it pretty accurately there was no cohesion or control it was quite literally the dream controlling me and I had left the immediate environment in my mind as does happen to me when I eat a certain amount of mushrooms, out of body trances.

Passiflora? I don't think St John wort would be correctly called that but that might also cause interactions...


Yeah losing control is pretty much how I would describe psilohuasca myself, the MAOI undermining your natural resistance is also how it felt to me: being hopelessly compromised by the very trancy dreamy earthy more-spiritual-than-usual trip. Not sure if ayahuasca feels that way but I didn't appreciate it although I had pretty interesting visions full of symbolism.


fwiw I don't think the plain cyclopropyl moiety makes a compound carcinogenic or mutagenic, nor a MAOI. The placement matters a lot, also in relation to the amine probably... I imagine if the placement is just right, it might obscure and prevent normal activity of an enzyme for example.

I wonder if it matters a lot that the N-methyl could still get cleaved even if metabolic enzymes have trouble with the N-cyclopropyl. Unless the compound is abnormally weak itself and RIMA inhibition compensates for that, it doesn't seem like it's very significant but the dicyclopropyl might be another story? I would exercise caution with that until more is known. But, it's not available and don't really know how realistic it is anyway.

Yeah, I'd actually never even heard of prazepam before, that's not something that happens often these days with drugs lol. That's cool about the buprenorphine and naltrexone though too, and now that you mention I actually can recall seeing several opioid molecules that had that cyclopropylmethylamine in them. The ciprofloxacin seems particularly significant though, both because of the dose like you said and the fact that its cyclopropyl group is directly attached to the nitrogen just like in the McPT molecules. It sure makes taking doses like the 25-50 mg amounts these things would likely require seem a good bit less potentially risky.

Yes N-cyclopropyltryptamine and also 5,6 and 7 (di)methoxy analogues were found to be MAOIs but that is without the N-methyl. Also NcPT is supposed to be hypoglycemic. Not sure if there is any relation there but it would probably help if someone did a finger prick test and/or report if feeling woozy etc with this 4-HO-McPT.


Don't know how noticably MAOI activity may cause headaches or vasodilation or something like that, or what the chance is that McPTs are like NcPTs. Be careful I guess.


I should clarify that I didn't mean plain cyclopropyl compounds are no MAOIs, just that it doesn't automatically make them all a MAOI.

And I have to say, it was actually fantastic.... It was honestly one of the best trips I've ever had on any psychedelic ever, with both extreme euphoria and crazy intense closed eye visuals with a DMT-like sense of life to them. It sounds much like what you said someone was able to get out of insufflating McPT, which leads me to suspect even more than I already had that these chemicals are being chronically underdosed.

Did you have an afterglow like that beyond the main effects of McPT? I ask because I'm honestly starting to suspect that it may just be an effect of this class of molecules, like the afterglow from smoked DMT. I actually tried smoking MET earlier today after all and noticed the same kind of thing, a fairly quick trip followed by euphoria lasting several times longer.

It’s above - 25mg MIPT only one trial with friends - MIPT wasn’t flash but it started to have a trippy (mainly) mind set as mentioned in thikal - it wouldn’t surprise me that MIPT could potentially be better at a higher dose - I think it would have more intellectual capacity than with McPT which was more a sedate drift - there was the beginnings of experimenting vapping McPT but of the two drugs given the choice to try again orally I’d go with MIPT I think. Tried MAOI with several typtamines and a PEA; I don’t know if some of these plant MAOIs are really potnent enough to be reliable and I’d go betacarboline or moclobemide; they bring there own flavours though. The only thin g really beyond this is someone to actually try 4HO-McPT; originally I called 4AcO-DALT “Allacetin” following naming conventions - this is harder ‘Mcyclocin” I guess; not sure these names are more helpful than 4HO-McPT though

Awesome, thanks for the information once more. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I'd really like to try McPT one of these days based on what you say actually, even if I just get a few experiences in. The MiPT definitely is awesome though, and I do love that cognitive aspect of it, at that 50 mg for me it was still pretty lightheaded but I definitely could feel a classical headspace starting to develop. How much McPT did you try vaping? I think I'm going to try that with MiPT soon actually, since my MET attempt was pretty successful in that way.

You don't really follow up an "M" with a "c" for a trivial name though.


I already mentioned **Cipro**floxacin and Tranyl**cypro**mine which both shorten "Cyclopropyl" to "cipro/cypro".


Consequently, I'd suggest "Meciprocin" (or "Mecyprocin") as the trivial name for 4-HO-McPT.

A hypothetical 4-HO-N,N,-Dicyclopropyltryptamine would be "Ciprocin"/"Cyprocin", and 4-AcO-McPT would be "Mecipracetin".

Meciprocin/Mecipracetin isn’t right to my mind - your kind of grabbing a “i” out of no where confusable with the more common isopropyls despite other names alluded to; “i” & “y” are phonetically similar. “Mc” can be said “ma-cyclo” but probably there is fair argument for MEcyprocin or MEcycloprocin - I actually prefer the latter aesthetically but do wonder what what these common names are actually for apart from intellectual wanking; 4HO-McPT is short and clear and unambiguous - anyway but time someone took some : )

The MiPT definitely is awesome though, and I do love that cognitive aspect of it, at that 50 mg for me it was still pretty lightheaded but I definitely could feel a classical headspace starting to develop. How much McPT did you try vaping? I think I'm going to try that with MiPT soon actually, since my MET attempt was pretty successful in that way.

To be honest McPT wasn't that exciting to most testers - I felt a bit odd and ataxic at the peak - might have just been that trip - I tried vaping I think 20-25mg and did get much; I have enough to retry - perhaps my tech was off/or pipe grubby or something since it should have been active at that range based on other compounds that are closely related (and shall remain unspoken of for the present; I don’t know there fate) being pretty active; I think McPT and 4hO-McPT should be pretty effective that way

Haha, awesome Kaleida! That's my plan as well. Maybe we'll meet up in 4-HO-McPT hyperspace. What dose were you planning on taking? I'll probably go with around 16 mg, even though it probably won't be a full dose, just in case it's unusually strong, or has a nasty bodyload.


EDIT:


Yesterday was my sub-threshold (~1mg) 4-HO-McPT test. Two and a half hours after the test, I ate a meal with a generous serving of balsamic vinegar (high in tyramine, which causes hypertension with an MAOI), and two cups of strong green tea (caffeine also is known to cause hypertension with MAOIs). There was no unexpected change in blood pressure or pulse.


Now, this little test obviously doesn't rule out the potential that it has some MAOI properties, but if 4-HO-McPT were a potent irreversible MAOI capable of causing life-threatening hypertensive crisis in combination with tyramine at a psychedelic dosage, I would expect there to be at least some tiny measurable effect from eating a tyramine rich meal on 1 mg. Correct me if I'm wrong.


The other possibility is that the 4-HO-McPT was already fully metabolized by the time I digested the meal. Regardless, I'm not too worried about it.

Sweet, I'll see you there. :D It'll be cool to get two different perspectives on a new chemical at the same time! I'll be going with my standard dose for trying new 4-substituted tryptamines, 25 mg orally, so that I can make the fairest comparison to all my other first experiences. I'm not too worried about having an unexpectedly strong trip this time, my setting is actually so much better than normal even that I would welcome it. As for the body load, I'll have access to a good few MAOI-safe pharmaceuticals to counter it if need be, plus nitrous if it's just something like overly strong tremors.


Glad to hear that your test went well too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I can't say how much it would apply to recreational doses either, but since we honestly know nothing about what its MAOI activity could be if it does have it, it's probably in our best interests to know for sure that it's not already present at such a low dose too!

TheAppleCore, if you haven't dosed yet, you may want to consider going a bit higher. I'm sitting here right now on 25 mg at T+1:35 and this is honestly a solid +/-, with cannabis pushing it in to a +. There are no visuals and no real physical effects except maybe some placebo-level increases in sweating, and I felt like there was maybe a slight dreamy rush reminiscent of the other tryptamines coming on in the first fifteen minutes but then it settled down to a euphoria that was only present in my legs, which was definitely there but could only be felt when not using them. At T+1:00 I wasn't even definitely sure I was feeling anything, so I started smoking a bowl of cannabis that I just recently finished while listening to music. By about two thirds of the way through I felt I was at the +, there is definitely a feeling present in this experience that tryptamines give me at the peak that cannabis does not, most notable in that music sounds just a bit better than normal but I am more inclined to laze around than to get up and dance. I can also tell that my imagination is just slightly enhanced when I actually try to use it, but there's no real push to.


I don't have access to my stash right now and I wouldn't redose now if I did, but I am suspecting that this one may need to be taken at a higher dose than this next time for at least myself. It definitely does feel like something psychedelic is there, at what strength I can't really say, but something real. I expect this to be a pleasant day regardless, and will definitely report back with any further updates of significance.


Edit:


So, it's about T+2:20 now and it's been long enough that I'm pretty sure nothing else is going to unexpectedly develop with this now, I seem to be slowly returning to full sobriety more than anything. Something else notable though is that not long after I made this post I actually started feeling a pretty good amount of excited energy very similar to basically every other N-methyltryptamine I've ever taken, and that was quite fun to work with for dancing to the music, particularly songs like the above hehe. It's starting to pass now too, but I'm still feeling good from it.


I'm sorry I couldn't give you guys more than this for now, but I definitely will write a trip report about what I did get out of it when it's all said and done, and I'll definitely try it again at a higher dose soon. I am very much thinking also that if later today I am still in the mood I might try taking some other tryptamine to see if the effect is reduced, as it should be from slight tolerance alone, or enhanced, as it might be if this chemical does have MAOI effects at this dose. We'll see though.


I'm heading off to take a bath for now though, that should be nice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

^ Thanks for the update Kaleida! I was totally convinced that I felt something from my 1 mg tester, which I insufflated, so now I'm starting to think I might use another ROA for my experiment. Although, the power of suggestion is strong, so maybe that's all it was for me.

No problem, can't wait to hear how your trial goes! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It would be very interesting if it was that much more active insufflated, but it wouldn't be too unlike some other tryptamines with bulky tails. I wonder if that would actually be better anyway to avoid any potential gastrointestinal MAOI interactions, hmm....


I actually just finished eating a basic burger with American cheese, French fries, and a cookie, which seems safe enough based on some quick reading I did online, so we'll see if anything happens. I'm not anticipating too much at this point.


Still feel good too, there has been a bit of a wave-like pattern to the euphoria mentioned before. It's weak but still nice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Afraid not, I really was thinking about it but then I started to develop a bit of a rebound headache. Serotonergic drugs in general often give me this, and especially tryptamines of the psychedelics, but I didn't think it would be too bad with this one given the weak effect. It got annoying enough that I wouldn't really want to go into another psychedelic trip with it though, I actually recently started drinking a beer instead to help it go away. The night's not over yet, but I'm not expecting it at this point.


I'm considering maybe trying something Monday since that would still detect an irreversible MAOI effect, but I'm kind of hesitant now too. My last couple trips have had more noticeable rebound headaches than usual so I'm feeling like maybe I should wait a full couple weeks this time.


I'll definitely add any more relevant updates though. I'll probably keep pushing the foods over the next few days too to see if any concerning reactions arise.

I decided against experimenting tonight; if 25 mg is barely threshold for oral, then I'm not really interested in that ROA altogether... I was considering insufflation, but unlike most other 4-hydroxylated trypts, this one actually felt like snorting a bumblebee's arse, so that's also a little intimidating. I think, if anything, I would try sublingual, at some point if I were feeling particularly adventurous, and willing to endure the horrible taste and potential burn. But, not for now.


Went ahead and gave ALD-52 a go instead, another one I haven't had the chance to try (surprise surprise, it's really nice).

Yeah, as much as I'd love to be able to justify tripping every week, I'm starting to think that typically two weeks is about the period necessary for my body and mind to reach a proper equilibrium between trips.

Sounds  reasonable, I probably wouldn't want to snort it either lol. Never been  too big a fan of that route.... I don't suppose you've considered  trying plugging it? That might be something I give a go.

Hehe, I'm right there with you. Two weeks at least has actually been my norm for a while now, but I've been pretty excited with all of these novel molecules appearing on the scene, I've been making more exceptions to the rule than I had in a while. I definitely felt better with the two weeks though, both with myself and with the strength of the trips, so I think I am going to start doing that exclusively again.... I'm sure the experiences will be the most worthwhile that way anyway, and I definitely do want to get the most I possibly can out of these chemicals while they're still around. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Do you happen to know if 4-HO-DPT has a high rectal bioavailability? If 4-HO-McPT suffers from the same obstacle in oral metabolism that 4-HO-DPT does, then this might be a good indicator of whether it's a viable ROA.

Hmm, I'm looking around and I'm not really seeing any reports of people  having tried 4-HO-DPT rectally, so I'm afraid I can't answer that. DPT  does have good rectal bioavailability compared to oral though, doesn't  it? I'm not sure if that would say anything about 4-HO-McPT, but it does  seem like it might make a good argument for 4-HO-DPT being similar to  me.

Have any of you guys tried this yet? Kaleida's report doesn't sound too promising, but I still have hope for it. Back when the vendor first mentioned some of the new compounds they had synthesized, I sent them an email asking if any of the new cyclopropyl lysergamides and tryptamines would be put on the market. They told me they were going to test them to see if they are worth selling. So that means they didn't release 4-ho-mcpt just for the novelty of it. Somebody thought it was worthwhile.

It probably just has a higher dosage.  4-HO-DPT, for example, seemed like a total dud when it first came out but then people figured out how to use it and that it needs higher dosages and I've heard some say it's their favorite substance.  I certainly like it a lot in any case.  For that one, it works orally at very high dosages, and nasally it works at lower dosages but still higher than typical oral dosages of 4-sub-Ts.  It should be worked up slowly but my guess is it will show full effects at some dosage.

Smoking/vaping would also likely be a decent way to get effects out of this at a reasonable amount; find that preferable to snorting tryptamine and it works for other a subs although the only one I personally tried was 4aco-dalt and it was really rather lovely.

Most reports I've read say that vaporizing 4-subbed tryptamine salts is less efficient than oral. Not sure if that's true across the board though. (4-HO-MiPT?)


Given the reports so far, I'm actually thinking about plugging this this weekend, perhaps at 20mg. Kaleida, AppleCore, any thoughts on a good starting rectal dose?

^ Kaleida would probably give better advice than me, but I might use the bioavailability margin in 4-HO-DPT as a reference. Sifting through the Big & Dandy 4-HO-DPT thread, it looks like plugged 4-HO-DPT is roughly twice as potent as oral. So, assuming that 4-HO-McPT might behave similarly, if 25 mg was a threshold oral dose, something around 12 mg might be a threshold dose for plugging.


I would guess that you'd need at least a five or sixfold, if not tenfold, multiple of a +/- dose for anything decently psychedelic. So that might be in the realm of 70 mg and upwards. But all of this is a lot of theory with very little evidence to go by.

I've not seen many reports - I think MGS said 4aco or ho -det was effective  maybe (?) and like I say 4aco-dalt way more potent smoking (at least x4 probably more) could be a difference with HO and AcO mind

Most reports say that vaporizing 4-subs is not as effective as other methods of ingestion. I have tried it with 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MiPT and it was less efficient than dosing orally, although I did smoke the fumarate salts and not freebase. I have seen reports of people vaporizing freebase 4-HO-MPT and getting good results.


Anyway, I don't think vaporization would be the best method of using 4-HO-McPT. There's no reason not to try it, but I have a feeling it isn't the most effective way. One thing to consider is that cyclopropyl groups aren't particularly stable, so it's possible that the 4-HO-McPT will burn easier than the other tryptamines.

Wasn't point scoring-  this just made me laugh (since I'm on 4ho-dpt) - just adding to anecdote on vaping aco-dalt is potent with what I read on the 4ho-dpt thread but that's you cj187 !!! : ) 

hope you don't mind me quoting 


"I'm starting to think that vaporization is a very effective method for all tryptamines. Most people say it's not very efficient for 4 substituted tryptamines, but I think that's just because they are normally found as salts. There are reports of people successfully vaporizing 4-HO-MPT that was sold as a freebase. I think I read somewhere that Alexander Shulgin tried vaporizing psilocybin or psilocin and it worked. I have vaporized metocin and miprocin in their fumarate salt forms and I got some effects, but less than if I had taken it orally. I think as a freebase it would work pretty well."

Lol, yeah, I made that post, but afterwards I started to question whether vaporizing tryptamines is really as useless as most people say. I wasn't afraid to waste some 4-HO-DPT for the experiment because I stocked up on it without having much experience with it. It turned out to not live up to my expectations, and now I have more than I know what to do with.


I think there is a good chance that vaporizing 4-HO-McPT will work. Still, the relative instability of the cyclopropyl group is something to consider. I don't know that much about chemistry though, so I can't predict if the heat of vaporizing the molecule could cause a reaction. I would definitely convert it to freebase fist.

4acodet was very active smoked...the freebase.  Cant remember trying any other psilocin analogues that way.

Gosh my memory actually works - thanks MGS. I know of other drugs with a cyclopropyls in the structure that vapped fine too but can't say more. Not over excited about this being an MAOI either; it would have to be the right type and potently so before there was potential risk. monoamine or other modus operandi would be dangerous or a drug could be dangerous for all sorts of reasons.

Is it actually a significant MAOI though?  I mean AMT is talked about as an MAOI but I have never noticed any MAOI effects from it in combo with other things.  I mean everything broken down by MAO is an MAOI to some extent, technically, since it occupies some MAO enzymes.


Just wondering what evidence we have that this is actually an MAOI worth worrying about.

In regards to AMT's MAOI activity, three friends and I consumed 15-25mg of AMT as well as 100mg of MDMA six months back and ended up having the heaviest most mongy roll ever and then the next day feeling like total, literal, absolute shit. None of us having ever experienced any comedown/after effects even close to it. One of our friends even being in her early 40s and having partied a LOT in her day. MAOI effects of this I'm not sure, but with AMT, we need to be careful.

Pretty much none. Just vague speculation based on other related compounds showing MAOI activity.

'MAOI' gets bandied about like anything on forums, it is not always very meaningful or relevant and I can't see much vigorous evidence for this compound. AMTs been mixed with all sorts - maybe best avoided but aMT is a very weak MAOI and a reversible one anyhow. I suspect many effects would be more additive than potentiating. I've tried to learn a lot about MAOIs and it's complex (I am far from understanding it all); it isn't quite a case of a little knowledge being a harmful thing since it's best people don't risk things but "MAOI" is far from meaning dangerous full stop. drugs can be dangerous by different method; cutlery can be sharp.


Wondering how to approach 4ho-mcpt - 40mg oral mcpt gave reasonable effects some 4ho's are more potent (mipt,dipt etc.)than the base tryptamine but it's not guaranteed and I have very little; kaleidas 25mg report suggests it is about the same as mcpt. smoking is generally good but a freebase ideal and making it so could waste the material. With the exception of a few things like ket snorting is just awful. Never plugged and not that keen but it's looking better than some options as long as there isn't much to go wrong with them tech. If I had more I'd just go oral even if it took more. surprised we're still waiting on real results.

Has anybody tried this yet? I can't find any information other than Kaleida's trip report. It seems that people are scared to try it because it's supposedly dangerous, although I can't find anything at all to back up that claim. Does anybody have a source on some reliable information on the potential dangers of 4-HO-McPT? People claim that cyclopropylamides cause DNA damage, but I can't find any evidence of that. That rumor seems to be caused by the fact that cyclopropylpyrroloindole based anti tumor drugs bind to DNA to kill cancerous tissue. I'm considering getting some 4-HO-McPT, but if anybody has a real reason to believe it's not safe then I won't.

I guess people are wary because cyclopropane easily reacts with things because the ring is under strain. I wouldn't eat that stuff personally.

My intention is to take this one again soon, probably at 50 mg. I'm shocked that there still aren't any other reports by now.... It'd be nice to have a second opinion too, but I'll contribute what information I can for now when I have it. I can understand people being afraid of the novel structure for now, but personally I'm not too worried anymore.... I'm at least willing to get through the supply I have currently without being concerned about DNA damage or anything like that, so I will have more to say on it eventually.

That's good to hear. I'm really curious about it. I almost bought some the day it became available, but I decided to wait and see if it's interesting first, thinking it would only be a week or two before people started posting trip reports.

Yeah, I'm not too worried at this point. I do think there is some logic to the MAO stuff... but I can't speak to the DNA damage. It's not like I'll probably ever have this drug again once this stash runs out though, and I didn't notice any unpleasant effects of reactions from my 25 mg experience so far, so I'm at least willing to push a good bit higher.


I was originally planning for it to be a little sooner than this, but I think I'm ready for it now. If I have the ability to trip on Monday, which is generally my free day for tripping, I'll definitely try out that 50 mg. And if that doesn't work, I'll try something like 75 mg the week after that. And so on until we finally get some real information about this one. 8(

I did a quick research on cyclopropane, and the thing itself doesn't seem to be a mutagen/carcinogen, which seems reassuring. it even was used as an anaesthetic gas akin to nitrous oxide. allthough being bound to an amine might change things.

Oh yeah, I'm not worried about that, like I said I'll only do it so many times anyway lol. What I mean to say is that I didn't notice any effects or reactions that would make me suspect that there were MAOI effects at play. Over the course of the week after my trip I started out slowly eating things that you're supposed to avoid on MAOIs, and over time just started shoveling more and more of it down my throat and going crazy and testing the limits. Nothing ever happened, so I'm not too worried about that either. I didn't do anything to rule out temporary MAOI behavior, but I didn't see any signs of long-lasting effects like that.

This threads full of lame and wild speculation about DNA mutation (LSD anyone?) with near to bugger all to back it up - the MAOI stuff (shock horror) even less as far as I can see. As for cyclopropyl being desirable in a psychedelic not quite sure how to read that other than it's theoretically less stable. Other drugs and medicines exist with it in and I was party to an email where other cyclopropyl psychedelics had being made and tested was mentioned though without details.

Eitherway I fear this stuff no more than anything else so it might be a race between me and Kaleida to nom it.

Really looking forward to it myself, I'll definitely report back as soon as I have something meaningful to say. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Other drugs and medicines exist with it in and I was party to an email where other cyclopropyl psychedelics had being made and tested was mentioned though without details.

Well, let's not discount the actual dangers now just because unlikely ones are also discussed too much. I'm also tired of the seemingly baseless DNA damage speculation, but N-cyclopropyltryptamine is a MAOI, that's a fact. So there's definitely not even less of that, and I don't see any good reason to assume that it can't extend to N-cyclopropyltryptamine psychedelic too. The fact that no one trying seems to have had issues with it yet doesn't necessarily mean anything because MAOIs themselves aren't dangerous, we really won't know until someone tries to push the interaction or dietary limits while also tripping, which I sure as hell won't be the first to.


It's annoying that there's been months of speculation and still no reports, but cyclopropyl substitutions on tryptamines are total unknowns in terms of safety, either through scientific testing or widespread recreational use. A good amount of speculation is healthy and welcome. It just needs to also be balanced by actual experimental data....

Good point but it's just a bit of me dies when I hear MAOI since it seems to hold an irrational fear for many over other potential threats - the 2CTs got labelled as being MAOIs although I can't see any evidence that 2,5 subs are (the opposite in fact) - speculation is good if it has some foundation but if it's half read and become a meme (2CT) I am not sure what is gained. I could only find: "N-Cyclopropyltryptamine as well as the 5- and 7-methoxy derivatives is a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor for both tyramine and tryptamine substrates."

[https://www.researchgate.net/public...propyltryptamines_potent_monoamine_oxidase_in](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/22076166_N-Cyclopropyltryptamines_potent_monoamine_oxidase_in) hibitors


So if EMTM is the same as cyclopropyltryptamine it could have maoi effects" I don't know why it's a 'could be' by the end of that but the link doesn't work. 

McPT hasn't show risks I am aware of although that could be statistical luck of course but I wasn't discounting dangers I just said I fear it no more than anything else. Any RC could be dangerous but most deaths from the category as a whole don't look neatly linkable to MAOI effects (if a drug kills you via pulmonary oedema the fact it isn't an MAOI isn't much solace). MAOIs are difficult since even pushing dietary limits doesn't doesn't tell you much unless you have a very reactive irreversible (although the outside chance of interactions easily avoidable) and of course most psychedelics seem to offer some long term dangers to the heart.

Sir Ron Pib, if you've only got 50 mg of this stuff I would definitely recommend you try a route other than oral.


I took 50 mg tonight and I'm still feeling it a bit, but it's mostly down now and I'm actually in bed and pretty much ready to sleep. I'll attempt to articulate my thoughts on the experience into a report some time tomorrow, but since I know you were thinking about taking it tomorrow too I just wanted to add a quick update here first.


I think that 4-HO-McPT has great promise, but at this dose, it's the most mild psychedelic of all time. It makes 4-HO-EPT seem extremely obvious and in your face. I would honestly describe it more like a serotonergic stimulant, the clean psychedelic energy without the trip, no visuals or headspace at all other than stimulation. It was an incredibly pleasant experience though, I spent most of it listening and dancing to music with enhanced appreciation, and thought deeply about a good amount of things. It just wasn't in any way what I would call a trip, at least in that peak energy phase.


After that died down things did get slightly tripper, and that's when I could tell it had promise. The distortions were oh so light but still hinted at significant complexity, but never got off the ground. The most interesting part was while meditating, which produced some undeniably psychedelic visual effects that seemed very deep, it actually reminded me a bit of ETH-LAD in some ways, but this was incredibly fleeting and really had to be milked out. Still I think it suggests something great though, but it'll probably need a good bit higher of a dose still or a more rapid delivery route.


Anyway, I'm off to bed now. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thx kaleida. I think I'll pass on this one if there is almost no effect at 50mgs but stimulation. Not what I was expecting tbh. Next up give us a malt freebase report please!

Really interesting to have you input Kaleida, something concrete at least. Well at least you think it looks interesting - more like 4HO-DPT potency perhaps? Also you don't mention duration - I was guessing roughly fairly standard 4HO duration +/-4 to 8hr depending on individual dose etc but possible on the shorter end of the scale?

No problem, and yeah if you're pressed for cash I probably wouldn't go for it at least just yet.... It was quite nice for what it is, but I'm not sure it'd be worth the cost if this is *all* it is. I still have some optimism though, and I'll be taking a higher dose soon (probably a couple weeks from now) so we'll see how that pans out. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**1**


Tested 4-ho-mcpt fum. twice, orally in gelcap:

1) at 14mg (to check the activity and body response) - get only +1 for 2-3 Hours. Some tryptamine body buzz, enhanced concentration but overall nothing really special to describe.

2) At 38mg with a friend (took 34mg).  Went for a mount hike near the alpine ski resort. Effects started at +40min point and peaked at +1:10. Tryptamine body high reminded of both 4-ho-met and 4-ho-dpt, bit of clumsy-fluffy not the dipt/mipt type of energy. Mentally state was dreamy and lazy, though processes became slow and smooth (Surprisingly trip went without 4-ho-dmt/met yawning). Not a deep psychedelic in any aspect at this dosage. Social interactions went clear but also bit lazy and slow, some empathy enhancement was present. Overall Duration about 5.30 (enhanced by smoking a joint at 4:30). No negative side effects were present.


[FONT=Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, Calibri, Geneva, sans-serif]I think 50-60mg is good starting point with this substance if you know exactly what you have.[/FONT]

Hey valera, thanks for the report and welcome to Bluelight. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) It's nice to actually hear about others taking this for once, and it seems we have found similar results in terms of potency.


If you do try this one again any time soon, we'd definitely love to hear more about it! I'm planning to take 75 mg soon myself to see if that will be enough to really bring the trip out.

I think this stuff is just lovely - tried 43mg by insufflation - I think 50mg or so by parenteral administration  would be great or probably a good 100mg or so orally - report in TR

Here is a short report with a total of **~104mg 4-HO-MCPT**: 
	
	


		HTML:
	

 I might have had a slight tolerance (I've taken 2C-T-21 three days prior. 3-4 days being my 'standard tolerance' for psychedelics).

T+0:00 - I've taken 72mg of 4-HO-MCPT orally enwrapped in cigarette paper.
T+1:15 - I did'nt feel anything that was distinguishable from a placebo.  So I decided to go for another 32mg intranasally to kick things off. The burn is strong with this one.
T+1:20 - Yep, this was needed to get the ball rolling. Started to come up within a few minutes. Very nice, geometrical visuals, reminiscant of other tryptamines. A cool bull-like pattern on my wall. Friendly headspace. For some reason I decided to register on this strange internet forum called 'Bluelight'.
T+2:30 - Starting to come down.
T+3:45 - Pretty much back to baseline.

This is the first tryptamine I've taken in over a year and I don't know what to think of that one. The main part of the trip is like 2 1/2 hours if at all. This short duration might make it interesting for some use-cases. What also comes to mind is the combination with a MAO-Inhibitor which might increase the duration.
Also this had almost non-existent bodyload which is kind of disappointing. But also no nausea whatsoever which is kind of nice.

I might try this again with an initial dose of 120mg orally.

Well thanks to a vendor mishap, 200mgs turned into 200grams. It had been a while since I've tripped, nearly a year, and been waiting to try it, there wasn't much info at all so I just waited for time. 


Anyways, nearly an hour ago I smoked 15-20mgs off some bud, I feel like the effects of that dose came in within a few minutes. It feels pretty good, pretty good euphoria, visuals look not really distorted, just has a shine to it that makes it less clear. Good vibes on it. I'm actually going to dose a little more, but it seems like they're could be some very good effects. It's been a while since I've done any tryptamines like this, and although I like to trip, I don't have experience with the majority of these newer compounds. I've only used lsd, mushrooms, dmt, 25enbome, One shroom analog I actually can't remember, and this. I'll report more here later this afternoon after the redose and comedown, to give a better report.

How the fuck could 200mgs a 20$ purchase turn into 200gs?  Mcpt is rare and not very popular so unless it came from China you probably have all of the stock the had.... It makes absolutely no sense at all to me for a mishap of that magnitude to happen.

Yeah it was from china. I bought ten grams of 4clpvp, looking into a decent stim and sent them an extra twenty for 200mgs. I only talk  to them in emails and never through a site so I was able to get a sample. They're cool, always able to get samples if I order. They sent it a new way, idk if they sent it themselves or if it was a different party through them, anyhow they made a miscalculation.  I believe it was through a party because .200 and 200 are close in text, just forgetting the period. But, my girl also found out, not good, and had to flush like 145-150 grams. Luckily put 40grams up and the 10gs of 4clpvp, just kept the extra weight out as getting a sample. It was like 12 grams so I've been messing with the two grams. She didn't want bulk around, especially before the convesation so I was lucky to keep any of it. I didn't really feel at a loss other than just losing it, I still came out way a head. Sorry just felt the need to explain that. 


And yeah, redose of the same amount right after I posted previously, didn't do much more. I caped roughly the same amount about two hours later, the taste was way stronger, much more smoke. A slight increase in effects, but not much, felt like I was going back to baseline and it just pushed it enough to be noticeable. But wasn't strong, but overall the experience made for a good morning. The best way I could describe the effects at that dose, reminded me a lot like an after peak on effects. Like the point in an acid or shroom trip where the visuals slow down, more vibrant and colorful, enhanced, but nothing like wow. A pretty positive headspace, it didn't get deep or anything, but there also wasn't any sort of anxiety, which normally I have in a trip. It felt good, the euphoria for the first ten, twenty minutes I haven't felt in a while, it felt on par with good opiates, that's what came to mind at the time, but probably like good shrooms. I feel like the past few times I've done shrooms I didn't get the body buzz I like with it and just didn't think of it at the time. I also got hungry and ate during it, I'll have to see if they were foods to avoid with interactions, but didn't experience anything negative. I feel like it's gone for the most point, really after  4 hours or so. But hitting some bud ,and having a good morning, and no negative effects will lead me to try to go further. I've read mixed reports on oral though, I would of snorted it but my nose has been fucked since I've got the 4clpvp. I'll probably aim for around 100mgs, I might bring myself to snort it because the effects seem to be the best that way, but I've heard it hurts. Worse than the 4cl. 

Last weekend I gave my buddy a line to try, he was really wanting to, and he said initially it hurt like hell, and after about ten minutes apologized multiple times for then blowing his nose. But after about fifteen minutes he just said it started coming on strong, enough to where if you can get past the burn, it's worth it. He said it was very shroom like, but a little less visuals, and more body. His eyes looked way more trypt out than mine too today. But also, there was a few bong packs of bud, and multiple lines of 4clpvp and a few attempts at smoking. 

Sorry, if any of this is annoying to read, just wanted to share the most I can gather with this stuff. I feel like a lot of the ones I mess with are the most unknown ones when it comes to rcs, and it sucks when no info is posted, or if the info is just useless like "it's shit", or of the like. I 'll likely go a head and try again in a week or so and push it. 

Out of curiousity, if this is a completely safe compound in the areas that keep most people from studying it, does anyone have an idea how far you can push dosages?

I got ansy,  had about 4 hours to be at work, so I decided to give it another go. Snorting works way better than vaping off foil, or smoking of bud. Burns a bit, but it turns into relief after ten minutes or so. By the time I sneezed and had to blow my nose, I could taste the drain and effects started. Was approximately 40-50mgs, was expecting a sharper burn so was testing the waters. Very intense body like buzz, deeper trip than yesterday, but very positive. Watching tv in bed with the lights off was colorful, but not crazy. I would want to call it a dreamscape like trip. It was positive and happy, but lasted well into going to work, which is alright but being a service worker at a fast food place, taking orders with the time dialarion seemed endless. Now that I know what the burn brings, I'm gonna still go for around a hundred mgs on my next day off.

For those who have tried it - Is it worth buying 4-HO-McPT for it's stimulating effects? I personally like tryptamine stimulation so I think I might enjoy it...8)


Also, if anyone have tried, any difference of effects compared to it's 4-AcO counterpart?

In my experiences with all 4 sub tryptamines when the oral BA isn't so good insufflation or rectal administration is usually the best option who ever said they would take it sublingual is a brave person. Example - 4-aco-dpt  You can eat 50 mgs and have a mild to medium trip but if you snort 25-30 you will get a +++. Once I ate 25mg and insufflated 15-20mg and that trip had the best visuals I've ever had without a real bad mind fuck. The carpet literally bubbled up like a boiling bubbling cauldron! Happy tripping! and everybody please use self harm reduction techniques  while tripping!!!

The 4-ACO counterpart is most likely more potent by weight but the theory is that 4-ACO metabolizes into 4-HO when metabolized. Also 4-ACO counterparts are usually more stable and hold potency longer than 4-HO

I got around to taking 100 mg of 4-HO-McPT some time ago, and I still didn't manage to pass any kind of threshold I was first hoping for when I first got into this stuff, but I did have an experience of a kind that I'm able to appreciate much more these days and ultimately found it quite satisfying.


Essentially, it was like having the high of a 4-substituted tryptamine, particularly one alike 4-HO-MET, 4-HO-MPT, and 4-HO-MiPT without basically any of the trip, except that instead of being more like just some clean stimulation like the lower dosages, it had reached the level of a more intense but zen and contemplative headspace, so that one thing about it did have a very psychedelic feeling to it still. In retrospect, it was not unlike 4C-D in this way, which I had not yet taken at the time. I do recall feeling that it had a very positive afterglow as well.


I don't know if I'll continue pushing the dosage with this one or not, though I haven't seen any signs yet that would make me concerned for my health in doing so. I'm happy to have it already as it is either way to me though, it's not flashy but it's yet another novelty, and one that I enjoy enough.

The McPTs seem like they're probably not going to develop into anything. I'm glad they were made so we can know, though.

I would generally have to agree with that, though would note to any prospective chemist listening that I would still try McPT itself if it ever came into my life. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I probably wouldn't pursue 4-HO-McPT again, but I think I will get a lot of good out of it while it lasts.

I heard that they made test batches of McPT, EcPT, and PcPT a few years ago and decided that they weren't good enough to put on the market.

I heard the same, and then I ranted to them about how it's fucked for the vendors to keep information about those drugs to themselves for marketing reasons. I heard from the same source notable effects ascribed to them, so who's to say the vendors know they wouldn't be worth it for us better than we do?

Yeah that's true. I don't see why they don't anonymously release trip reports about these things.

If thought about picking this up for collecting purposes and to trip on a few times. Doesn't sound like the one to change the world but I'm sure it has it's virtues. The only thing is it's not exactly cheap for what it seems capable of. Seems like something to take and then go about your day as is. I'm a big fan of [day tripping](https://youtu.be/AYZlME0mQB8)


It's not high on my list though and who knows how long it will be around. Can't see them making this for years based on the reports. But i would still take it for the novelty factor.

I probably won't bother although one day this will probably be inordinately obscure because I doubt they'll make it again.  The collector in me says yes... the pragmatist in me conferenced with the collector and realized there are a whole lot more things to collect still.  Collecting psychedelics is an expensive hobby...

I'm about to try this today, at 60mg orally.  I got some in a trade, this will be my first trial.  I don't have a lot, so I decided to start at 60mg instead of lower, based on the small amount of existing reports.  Going to go on a long hike at a really cool spot, meeting up with an old friend of my girlfriend's.  She is microdosing LSD. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  She actually inspired me to trip today.  She doesn't too often want to ingest psychedelics so it feels somewhat like a special occasion.  Even if the effects will be very subtle for her,  it's still nice. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I will write a report when I get back.

**Theta:**


Looking forward to hearing what you've got to say. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) We don't use it much but I actually really like this one and feel like it would be a good subtler trip to match an occasion like that.

Has anyone titrated up to a +3 with this one, or is this simply not capable of producing that strong of an experience, akin to how it is with 4-meo-mipt? I'm not getting my hopes up too high knowing that pushing this to 100mg doesn't produce anything intense. Still, if someone is reckless and eats a shitload of this, please share the experience.

I have the feeling it is not capable of producing a +3, but it may be, at high dosages.  I have only tried it the once so far.  But I have read reports of up to 100 or 120mg (can't remember which, it was Kaleida's report I'm thinking of), without going above +2.  This one reminds me of 4-MeO-MiPT moreso than it does any other 4-sub.


I will say I would feel safe taking a mega-dose of this.  Just don't think I'll bother.  There are tons of tryptamines to have strong experiences on.

I took 27 mg of 4-ho-mcpt last night with a friend. It's an interesting chemical but not super trippy. I took some notes because information about this chemical is lacking but they might not be the best notes because I also consumed a lot of weed during the experience. Me and my friend might have dabbed almost a gram next to the other weed we vaped. It was a pretty dope experience but closer to a better version of getting stoned than tripping.


20:38 T +0. We tried to dissolve 60 mg of 4-ho-mcpt in water but it ended up being 54. We both drank half of it. Tastes pretty gross but not really grosser than most other tryptamines I've tasted. We were both already stoned before this point and I hadn't eaten anything yet outside of some mango less than an hour before.


T +0:05 I start to notice I'm tripping.


T +0:39 still no real visuals. Colours feel a bit more saturated, my head space feels different and I feel a bit stoned but in a different way from weed. Barely stronger than last checkup.


T +1:04 Still barely stronger than onset. I consumed weed during the last couple hours but I'll start to consume more now.


T +2:20 Definitely tripping harder than before but that might be all the weed I did.


T +2:28 Dabs are hitting me even stronger than before. MCPT combines well with weed.


T +2:55 I have some mild cev but I've had more from weed combined mild hppd.


T +3:27 I'm still tripping and everything looks a bit more polished and glassy.


1:16 AM T +4:38 I'm Pretty much no longer tripping but I am very stoned.


I then took some more weed over the course of the next couple hours and did some oxazepam to fall asleep because I usually sleep somewhere between 5 and 7 am.
