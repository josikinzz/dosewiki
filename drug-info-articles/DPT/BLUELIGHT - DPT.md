Not just because of tolerance, but because you'll be more psychologically hungry for a trip. These tryptamines all work on very much the same sets of receptors, so there will definitely be big tolerance going on as well.

I just need to wait to do it cause I have been taking massive doses of 4-subbed tryptamines in the last week about 400 mgs in three separate instances. so I want to wait at least a week from yesterday since that was my last time doing anything. Does anyone think that will be long enough. My tolerance is freaking insane especially reading what others take 20-30 mgs of 4 subs is just a tease even when I wait awhile. And you need a lot more DPT it seems to get anywhere interesting.

Good day, bluelight.  Today is a significant day if I do say.  


For this day brings light and darkness, inseparable, yet each distinguishable, upon the experiment that was underwent last night.  


Let us say that dpt reveals a revelatory secret.  A secret I'm not so sure was designed for human minds.  


Shall we just say that if you are looking for a trap door to heaven in the deepest pits of hell, DPT just might provide what you seek?

Yeah, DPT is definitely one of the relatively few that puts me in a domain where terminology like heaven, hell, holiness and glory applies. (I'm not a religious man, just feels that way)

That was what LSD made me feel like at times and I'm am also not religious. I am hoping DPT will be more involving for a lack of a better term than say any of the 4-subbed tryptamines. Not to say they can't be also.

It's been a quick minute since I've done DPT, but I caught myself thinking about it earlier today. What a really fascinating drug. I've never taken it further than 50 mgs insufflated but at that level it was definitely quite intense, on par with DMT in its intensity but it has a MUCH different vibe. It's interesting because they're chemical cousins of each other, and they each show you realms that are literally beyond human comprehension, but the places they bring you to are so much different. I would best describe DPT as DMT's "spooky" cousin because it definitely has a spooky vibe to it IME. While DMT is usually blissful and transcendent and the entities are happy and lively and engaging, DPT is a lot more dark and cold. DPT is just as crazy as DMT, but instead of crazy beautiful it is crazy weird and kind of scary, in this beautiful way. I'm sorry if this sounds like psycho-gibberish but there really is no way to describe either of these compounds well enough with the language that us humans have invented. They defy description.


But anyway DPT is pretty cool if you can handle it. I think the spooky factor would be a turnoff for a lot of people, but if you like your tryptamines (which I definitely do) then I would recommend trying it, it's unique and damn powerful. Maybe start with a ~25 mg dose to get a feel for the chemical, 50mg took me by surprise with how strong it was and I've read reports of people dosing in the 100+ mg range which is just insane. But yeah I guess the point of my post is: I have ~100mg of this lying around, I don't think I'll be taking it today but something tells me that I should go for a 50-60 mg dose soon. It's been a minute since I've had my ass handed to me by a tryptamine, which (while jarring) can be a pretty good way to cleanse the chakras if done every now and again. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

My greatest and only trip from DPT. 

I snorted a tremendous amount, something like 350-400mg maybe more, i wanted a 12 hour experience from it. 

SO one sunny afternoon in the backyard. After i snarfled and snuffled and burned my adenoids out because 

Trying to get that much of something that burns so much and begins within 15-20 minutes, is what i'm sure could be considered a beautiful thing to see. 

But none the less. Once i was done acting like a powder swine


The trip began, with a subtle vibration. A Cicada flew past my head. I remember knowing the trip was starting because when i closed my eyes, i became the sound of its wings flapping. 

I felt something ancient about it's buzzing that was going on in the neighborhood. Suddenly I got this feeling like i was about to know what it was like to spend 25 years underground. 

Suddenly the Cicada buzzing became intense, like too intense it was as if they were swarming me inside of my own head, but it was clear that this was just a synesthesia based aural expenditure of a very real thing cascading with meaning and resolve. I was probably crying and screaming in my back yard. Everything had begun to take on an incredibly silver almost ethereal tone. Just Blistering with "the light" When the Cicadas finally stopped buzzing. Everything became what i would like to say as "too calm" I hallucinated 3 translucent rainbow steeds galloping over my fence, heading right for me with white riders pointing their astral blades at me. They charged, i scurried around the yard on my hands and needs in some de-evolved state of primitive survival at that point. I finding the tree in my back yard. I rested myself underneath it. 


When i would close my eyes, i would see myself, only from above, and there was a rainbow colored a chain leading downward to myself. Like i was in 3rd person. or "spiritual" form, still connected to my Physical form, but now looking out of the eyes of my Astral form. Now when i would open my eyes, i was back on the ground in traditional out of the eyes perspective. So AS I LAY DYING, on the grass vibrating into oblivion. lolol. I decided to see what would happen, if i closed my eyes, in my "astral form". 


So when i shut my eyes, on "earth" to be up in the "ether" looking down at myself. I closed my Astral eyes. At which point you would think you would be given next to nothing to a whole lot of something.

But it was more or less what i feel is a slipstream of consciousness. But only for your DNA, your heritage. It will take you, anywhere you want to go in YOUR life. I am not not talking just about the life you are living right now.


I remember, when the steam would stop shuddering and hold it's focus long enough for me to look inside as if it was a mirror to a moving picture show or a movie. 

The first one was the High Seas, everyone i had ever known and all of the people i meet so far on this journey in my life have seemed to have at one point or another played a role in my life as a pirate.

Everyone was being hedonistic and violent glorious and brave, beautiful and bold. It was Triumphant, i remember we were feared on those High Seas.


Now when something in "reality" like a cat, or was it a car, or a noise would distract me, it was very easy to fall out of this "slip stream" so i was  granted them in bursts over a period of 4 delirious hours in the back yard.

DPT is alot like LSD in the sense, it peaks in WAVES but these waves are the maximum of receptor control. So as my ship was sinking in a mixture of reality going on just on the other side of a fence and serotonin delirium. 

I vomited a little bit, buried it poorly with some dirt, so the cat wouldn't come over and smell it, and be going through what i am going through or worse. 


Then once the vibrations began to pick up again intensely i remembered just go with it you aren't dying flow into the slip steam and you will be granted visions. 


So this time, my visions were of a jungle. Something was horribly wrong, People i thought of as the Gods were murdering my tribe. My eldest was sick. I remember leaving late at night to go to the jungle to look for medicine. 

Something is wrong feel like i am being followed. Then Rainbow blackness. Next thing i remember is being yelled at in a language i do not understand for things i do not think are wrong. I was just trying to find medicine for my family.

The Priest in white wants me to kiss his ring i spit blood on him before my throat is slit and i am kicked into the fire. 


By this point i am crying and abysmal on the ground in my backyard. I know what happened didn't happen right then in there. But it speaks from the past, like seeing something that gives you Deja Vu. 

But in your heart. I knew i was in for the long haul. The Vibrations slowed at this point, i was pretty distraught. I went inside i turned on some music i tried to find peace. Music sounded alien and tormenting. The house felt to small and cluttered with memories of a person i "wasn't" at that moment in time. To say i was emotions at that point is probably true to say, it's like having synesthesia to everything, complete and total raw nerve to "reality". Reality was "too loud" but there is no dimmer switch for reality. 


I went back outside to the front yard this time. Probably not the best choice given that it's near a relatively non busy street, in suburbia but still a GREAT enough location to give the neighbors a complete and total view of my overly emotional and disheveled insanity. I remember the cat was in the tree. So i started to repeat at the cat, "silly cat, you are a cat, not a bird." But in song, over and over and over again. Until kitty came down to play with me. That was really fun. When i looked up to realize there was a world going on around me, i realized that pretty much all of my neighbors were outside doing yard work, GIVEN it was a SUNDAY, in the Spring time. Now either this awareness of other people, triggered the next sequence  But kitty gave me a strange look like he knew what was up. The Dipropyltryptodemon was charging up for it's next and greatest surge at my serotonin ducts. I had to get to the backyard. 


Or somewhere away from the thoughts of other people. They were impeding my bubble and making me feel scared of authorities. 

So i close my eyes in an Old Recliner i have in the back yard trying to get comfortable. The vibrations on DPT are so intense sometimes you almost feel like you are going to turn your own bones into liquid. But not just the literal ones. 

So when i get comfortable, i am in the south of France, i am running around the streets  stealing bread, sleeping with pretty ladies, being a righteous swine. C'est La Vie, Non?

Non? I am caught by my wife having sex with a prostitute. she turns me into the authorities for a silver, for being a bread thief and then she brings the children to watch me get hung in town square. 


That one left me feeling dirty. I needed to bathe, i have been vibrating in my own vomit  rolling in the dirt and getting lost in my Temporal worm holes of space and time. 

So i peeled myself off the chair outside. I can't even imagine what my neighbors must be thinking is going on with me, if most of them ACTUALLY Are outside doing yard work. 

Got inside, got into the shower. 


It funny how the simplest things can remind you of yourself. Soap, a tooth brush, the shower nozzle, The Pattern the shower head beats into your skin.

All of these are sensations which are getting written into something you will experience again, and again, and again in what i feel are different modalities of life.

These images and these surges, allow me to realize that what i am percieving now is this life. 


As i have said before, i was abused a lot as a child, i don't really have a "huge" memory of my childhood. Despite everything DPT showed me.

It still protected me from this life, just a nice glowing beautiful ball of life and love which reminded me it's really not the past that matters. But it's fun to look back into it. 

All of these "times" i was in through closed astral eye visions. were very real. I could feel the rain, the sweat, the toil, the sex, the power, the darkness. 

Everything i experienced i felt it was like to "prove a point". That is to live a good life. We're given more than one, But the sins of your past lives are the trails of your current life. 

You can never truly conquer Samsara. 


I must have been in the shower for over 2 hours it was freezing by the time i returned to awareness again. Yes i did this DPT trip ALONE as i like to do most of the trips in which i know i am going to be "driving myself up the wall".

Its easier than having someone elses ego field there reacting with yours. The rest of the night played out the incredibly high dose acid with extremely powerful synesthesia to sound, music i normally liked, i loathed. Ultimately

I can understand WHY The Temple of the True Inner Light uses this shit as their Eucharist. It works. 


But what i don't understand is how DMT is illegal yet this one goes by relatively ignored by a majority of the recreational community. In a way that is a good thing. But if there ever was a casual user who was like

OMIGOD DMT SOUNDS TERRIF DPT LASTS LONGER, and they seek it out and DO IT before other compounds.... 


HOLY SHIT that would be a hellride of demented results. i could see that causes permanent ego//physic damage to those who aren't ready. 


But anyways... DPT. It's Only Hell of a Heavenly Drug.

Have you read anything about it? It can be pretty brutal so something must be off about your product...

Orally it can be weak / not very potent for some people... but if you IV'd it I can't think of another explanation... I do know there has been some shitty DPT circulating.

Snorted I did find it to be 'serious' material. Profound and jarring.

If your DPT is brown it might be from a certain "francophone" supplier who got rid of that shitty brown dpt (which was pretty weak) and replaced it with a new white batch.  I actually sampled that new white batch at 100mg nasally 2 weeks ago and was absolutely floored by how strong it was... It lasted only 3 hours from snorting to feeling pretty much sober but it came on so fast I was honestly very glad  I didn't take any more. I am usually a hardhead when it comes to Tryptamine. I have no problem with 80mg oral of 4-aco-dmt and had a great time on 300mg nasally of 4-ho-dpt.  100mg DPT kicked my ass!  I have to question the purity of your material if 250mg (some of that IV'd) didn't have you praying for mercy before the very throne of God.  The only other explanation would be if you had really severe tolerance by doing a lot of Tryptamines lately?

I've had brown DPT and it was apparently more potent than he is making his DPT out to be. Let's remember color (discoloration) is no more than an indication of purity, and DPT comes in more colors than any other drug I can think of. Brown, black-grey, purple, orange, and - as it should be - white.

How difficult could it possibly be to propylate some shit?

Or is the N-oxide of DPT of an interesting color like that of DMT? Still, that accounts for *one* color.

When Ive don dpt, it seems to almost be hit or miss. Sometimes if I dose too low I get barely any effects, but when done right I am blasted off into another realm. I have lived through different peoples lives from different eras as well as had the universe secrets opened up and shared with me. I have always done nasal, sometimes cutting it a little with mxe to make it a little easier with less burning, usually just 10-30 mgs, not too much, enough to smooth it out. The dpt I have is not very dense, so eyeballing it is near impossible. What I thought would be 100 mgs on a scale usually turns out to be 50ish mg.


I tried to freebase dpt once or twice but gave up due to failure. I added equimolar amounts of dpt and lye in distilled water, which produced an oil floating on top that proved very difficult to collect and remove. Would using naphta or something like that make sense to extract it from the water and then evaporate that in a pipe or onto a mock changa?

I added equimolar amounts of dpt and lye in distilled water, which produced an oil floating on top that proved very difficult to collect and remove. Would using naphta or something like that make sense to extract it from the water and then evaporate that in a pipe or onto a mock changa?

going back to my last post I don'y think i waited long enough between taking tryptamines. I had done some 4-aco-met only about a week before maybe less. could be shitty material though this is the second time i did all 250mgs snorting and iv'ing and not too impressed. all there other material has been great though. its cheap enough so since im broke for awhile i'll try one more time in a few weeks since i just went through 200mgs of 4-aco-met last week. need too cool the brain for now.

I recently got a hold of a small sample of DPT and 4-aco-DMT. Hoo boy!


I had never had the 4-aco-dmt before, and it was the main thing I wanted to go somewhere with, but the last time I had done dpt I got little to nothing out of it, which was due to me not taking nearly enough because I was a pussy back then and I didn't have the experience or depth of knowledge that I have now 4 years ago and I had only read some fantastical reports about it's effects lol. I was super eager to try both, in a good place, and with good friends that understood what I was doing. I weighed out 80mg, fully intending to have a rough time. 


Nope, great fucking trip! I felt like I left my body about 20 minutes in for about 3 seconds, just long enough to look at my self and jump lol. Then it was nothing but laughing and some really neat visuals for about 2 or 3 hours. At one point I could have sworn I saw my friends cat puke a pentagram, but that was just the dpt, good times. The come up feels awful, but in a good way. It's cold and odd, and really tooth clenchy. The stink and the taste and the drip suck, but seriously, it's far from the nastiest ting that people commonly snort, and at least it has the common decency to numb up the nasal passages after a second so that you don't really give that much of a darn.


It combined really well with the 4-aco-dmt. I took 20mg of the 4-aco and 40mg of the dpt and the experience was a very strong come up and a very colorful and imaginative first several house of the trip. You could clearly tell when the dpt was over with and it was just the 4-aco-dmt still with you. Things got less colorful and weird. You didn't see bugs that weren't there and weird shit like that lol either.


This substance has a strange ability to give me  full image hallucinations like almost nothing else I've ever had. I'm generally very hard headed and rarely do I see really impressive visual disturbances unless I take a slightly risky amount of a substance. On dpt shit starts to crystallize and I get afterimages of moving objects that can persist for a while. I see shit that didn't happen. It's not ok to be in public on DPT, it really could show you something fucked at the wrong time that could make you act bizarrely, which could get you mighty embarrassed, or worse if you can't deal with the situation. Most of the time, tripping isn't that fucky for me. I would probably try 100 mg next time I have it, if not more, but yeck, 80 sucked enough to snort lol.


I also did a 45mg bump on the tail end of a 1mg 25inboh trip, but it didn't do much, which is what I expected. It was interesting for about half an hour then it was just back to 25i. It gave the speediness of the 25i a bit of a dial-back and turned it into a spaciness that was mighty enjoyable. no real weirdness to report, but it was a light dose of dpt.

Maybe it was shit. cause i sniffed 100mgs to start and was only kind of fucked up i mean i had some viuals and would have felt weird in public but i was alone in the woods. still not what i expected could be a shitty batch. If it was from the popular canadian vendor it could be all there other stuff is great

I had recently received 250mg of DPT and had shared some with a few friends over a night, we were doing roughly 25mg lines every hour or two with pretty minor effects. At home alone on a good amount of MXE and roughly 40mg-60mg DPT and still not tripping as hard as I'd like. No breakthrough and mostly brain movies with little OEV's. Is the Canadian vendors current DPT bunk?

Vaped about 35mg of DPT about 25mins ago, and tripping balls. As expected, mixes very well with N2O.


EDIT: I ended up smoking a bit more, not sure how much, about another 30 mg I think. I quit using the scale because the effects are so immediate you can control your intake as you smoke. Wow! Who would have thought a substance that's so similar to DMT would be this good? I guess everyone except me. Amazing. Spent the first two hours laughing. Then it puts your life in perspective. Definitely look for this one guys if you enjoy the psychs.

It's what I have it was much much stronger than what I expected. 100mg had me nearly overwhelmed with OEV's but I was back to baseline by the third hour. Came on very fast and hard (can't stress that part enough) but left just as quickly. I got high so fast that I felt pretty nauseous at the peak but felt fantastic with no hangover as soon as I hit baseline. In comparison, 300mg of 4-ho-dpt from the same vendor was wayyyy more manageable than 100mg DPT.  The 4-ho version is definetly less serious but it's still close enough to DPT to be a more "serious" entheogen than say 4-aco-met.

I tried 200mg DPT orally this weekend and was shocked at how well it worked! I took it on an almost empty stomach and didn't notice any open eye visuals for about 1 and half hours than bam! Lots of DPT visuals.  It was slightly milder than snorting 100mg. 

I did have signifigant nausea at about the time the visuals kicked in but nothing too serious. 

I have read that DPT doesn't work rectally but I will try this next as it might avoid the nausea.  I'm wondering if the reason it doesn't work rectally is just a Ph issue? I wonder how different salt forms would be better or worse for rectal administration? If the hcl isn't that effective maybe the acetate would be better? Gonna have to run some tests. 

I love this chem but it either burns the fuck out of your nose (and who wants to trip with a burning nasal cavity???) or nausea via the oral route. I'm really hoping I can find a way to make it work via rectal admin!

Can anyone tell me about DPTs stability in the freebase form?

I will have the chance to try DPT soon and, from what I have been reading on bl, looks like freebasing and smoking is the best overall ROA.

So I am thinking about freebasing and then infusing it in some herbs, making it easier to handle/weight/vaporize.

Has anyone already tried that?

Would acetone be good to dissolve the oily base in order to infuse it in the herbs?

I've not tried infusing it in herbs, I'm really curious about this idea. I've plopped freebase onto straight onto herbs and ash, that seemed to work pretty well.

So, I've got 260mg of DPT HCL. My intended ROA is smoking, as oral seems to be less effective and I would prefer not to insufflate (plus I've recently had to quit weed so I don't mind a nice excuse to smoke some, I would have to sandwich the DPT since I don't have a vaporizer).

What I'm wondering, is do I really need to bother converting the HCL to freebase? For now I'm just sort of testing the waters, one of these nights I'd like to just try a few small bowls (25mg sandwiched between weed, if someone can recommend that, 1 or 2 times depending on how the first hits me).


Also, I am not only bad with chemistry, but I'm awful in the kitchen (I don't trust myself to fry eggs without fucking it up, perfectly competent with other things just not cooking). If I were to convert it, I've heard the easiest way is to use the method used to create crack cocaine, but I'm unclear of how that's done exactly, so I've got a few questions:

a) What materials would be required?

b) How do I determine how much baking soda : DPT I would need? (I believe they call this equimolar ratio, correct?)

c) Is it best to only convert the amount I intend to take immediately, or should I convert it all and store the remainder for later, and if so, what is a good method of storage?


I hope this doesn't come off as ignorant, I actually have searched several threads on BL and checked around a few other forums as well as looked into the crack/cocaine method in general. Thing is every single time I seem to have found a concise and clear description, there are things which throw me off, eg: using NaOH as opposed to baking soda, skipping over measurements and just giving a quick rundown assuming the reader has a chem background, etc.

I recently vaped DPT HCL. It took about 15minutes of smoking because it's best to put small amounts into the pipe and vaporise slowly.


About 50mg was a potent life-changing trip that lasted for about 4 to 6 hours, although the N2O I had surely contributed to potentiate the trip.


But I was also wandering about whether freebasing would be better. Someone please answer to Stranglerfish. Welcome to bluelight by the way ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for the welcome, glad to be here (it's about time I made an account). After reading here that HCL does in fact work, and hearing from you, I'm probably going to try it for starters. I'd still like a response to my questions a, b, & c, however aminophilous, would you agree that if vaping worked for you, and people who don't have a vaporizer for DMT find the sandwiching method to be successful, that the sandwiching method should also be sufficient for DPT?

Hi stranglerfish. You can smoke/vape the HCl indeed, but I highly recommend freebasing it, it's so easy and is just better. Sandwiching works well with either. Use flame gently, vape don't burn.


Here's how I make freebase from hcl (pasted from the smoking DPT thread):


The freebase method I used was as follows, not sure i this is optimal but it's what I did: In a spoon, dissolve 4 parts (by weight) DPT in a tiny amount of water, about 1 drop per 4mg DPT, using some gentle heat from a lighter to dissolve it. Once it's fully dissolved, add 1 part (by weight) of baking soda, and stir it in. You can see it react, and when it's done you're left with the waxy, moist freebase. I used a pin to drag the freebase out of any leftover water. Usually left it out to dry for a bit. Once I left it to dry for about 48 hours, and it looked a bit browned like it had oxidized a bit, but potency didn't seem diminished.


Good luck.

Yes, it's easy. Let me make it even easier:


Ingredients:

40mg DPT HCl

10 drops of water

10mg Baking soda (*not* Baking powder)


Tools:

A spoon

A lighter 

A thumbtack


Procedure:

1. Put DPT and water in spoon.

2. Hold lighter briefly under spoon to gently heat water.

3. Stir with the thumb tack, trying to dissolve the DPT in. It won't all dissolve on the first go.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all DPT is dissolved in water. Your goal is to not overheat the solution, but also to make sure every last bit of DPT is dissolved.

5. Once all DPT is dissolved, add Baking soda, stir it in well. You will see the solution bubble or foam a bit as it reacts. 

6. Once it has finished reacting, you'll be left with a waxy sludge. This is your freebase. 

7. If there is any remaining water, use the pin to pull the waxy bits out of the water. 

8. You can leave it to dry out for a while by placing it in a warm place, or just vaporize the damp freebase right away.


Congrats! Now you can get high on DPT freebase!

Wow thank you so much! I didn't notice the second page of replies and thought nobody was responding last night, I did end up attempting to sandwich at first 10mg, then 15mg, and then another 5 because the 15mg did have an incredibly minor effect. Tonight I was going to attempt insufflation before determining if it would be necessary to go out and buy a beaker and all.

I only have a few remaining questions that should be easy to wrap up in this case:

1) If all I felt last night was so mild that it could have been labelled as placebo (on the 15mg hit, after I got impatient I allowed the weed on top to burn, and ended up exhaling some harsh smoke through my nose, that was when I noticed shifting of sentences on my screen), would it be too soon to try vaping freebase tonight?

2) When you say add water, does it have to be distilled or is regular filtered tap water okay?

3) When vaporizing using the sandwich method, should the flame be lighting the weed at all, or is the weed just there in case you draw too strong to keep the flame from hitting the DPT itself? After a while, holding it above the weed with it only sliiiiightly crisping the top, I grew impatient and started to just roast it. I feel I didn't have a proper understanding of how the vaporization works, do I want the lit weed to be heating the DPT or do I want the weed to not light at all and only act as a sort of screen?

1) Yes, you'd be fine to try vaping freebase tonight.

2) Regular ol' tap water is fine.

3) Let the flame just lick the weed a tiny bit, a little tiny lick at a time. The idea of vaporizing is that you bring the chemical up to the point that it boils and vaporizes, but without burning it. So it needs to get hot, but not really really hot. So give it a touch of flame for a moment here and there, but don't roast it. That has worked for me anyways. 


You can tell you are vaporizing the DPT because you will taste it. There is a different taste between when it is burning and when it is vaporizing but it's a bit hard to describe. The burning taste is a bit like burning plastic, although vaped DPT seems a bit plasticy too. 


Hold the vapour in for a really long time, and use normal weed smoking techniques like inhaling air after your toke, to bring the smoke that's in your mouth and throat into your lungs, and hold it there. 


You don't need to light the weed up (or whatever smoking herb you use), it's just there to hold the DPT in place, yeah like a screen.


Actually I'd recommend not using weed because if it's one of your first times smoking DPT you want to be able to distinguish the effects from the weed effects so you know what you're working with. Try using old ashes, or some inert smoking herb like mint or even tobacco. It does combine well if you're into that, but for the first few times I think it's a good idea to solo the new compound.


When I vape DPT I start feeling it within seconds. Not like getting hit over the head, but it creeps up pretty quickly, and dissipates quickly too.

Well, I'm about to try vaping it! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) I think I may have heated the water a bit too long (I was using filtered water from the fridge cause our tap water is so damn cloudy I was kinda paranoid about some kind of contaminant, so I think I tried to compensate for the cold water a bit much, it dissolved before I could really stir it in, so likely won't be nearly as potent as should be). However, I do now have a waxy white sludge and I'm just waiting for it to sort of settle a bit more before I try and get the sludge into my pipe and have a go. I suppose while the process is simple it will still take me a bit of practice getting it all down (especially since the stuff is so damn sticky, I find it difficult to get all the powder off the measuring tray / into the center of the spoon, etc), I just hope I get a good enough feel for the experience tonight so I can decide whether or not it's worth ordering more! Wish me luck ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

However, I do now have a waxy white sludge and I'm just waiting for it to sort of settle a bit more before I try and get the sludge into my pipe and have a go. I suppose while the process is simple it will still take me a bit of practice getting it all down (especially since the stuff is so damn sticky, I find it difficult to get all the powder off the measuring tray / into the center of the spoon, etc), I just hope I get a good enough feel for the experience tonight so I can decide whether or not it's worth ordering more! Wish me luck ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

Well, it'll definitely take practice getting it just right but I definitely felt more that time. OEV still incredibly mild compared to say 2 tabs of 25i-NBOH, however things did take on a general bizarre appearance and there was waviness, as well as a bit of peripheral glowing across my ceiling, much like what I imagine someone meant in a report I read when they spoke of a "underwater effect".

Aside from that, while the experience was I suppose mild, CEV did produce a very useful realization as I'd been sort of sub-consciously trying to chicken myself out of a relationship I've been starting, I suppose just general fear of commitment as nothing has gone wrong nor has he given me any reason for a change of heart...in any case during the CEV, my mind drifted towards him, and I was seeing images of him as a sort of enemy-figure, armies of red robots marching with his face on their blocked heads, in a fiery setting, all chasing after me, that's the main shape I remember him taking...but at one point I sort of came to the realization that he was harmless and it was really me just thinking of him as something I should be fleeing from. When I realized this, I told myself to instead focus on the love, and as soon as the word "love" began to ring in my head, I saw good copies of him all beckoning to me, pointing forwards and up and as I followed their gestures the area behind them slowly began to split open, revealing sort of 2 dimensional image of what resembled diamond shaped auras (kind of like South Park's version of Moses to be honest), constantly radiating outwards. With that I firmly set my intentions of remaining in this relationship and pouring all my love into it.


I can't wait to see what a full-blown trip produces haha, I guess I had set my intentions beforehand but even then it's not like I was completely lost in the CEVs, still a mild trip but I got much more out of it than I could have with the phenylethylamines I have tried.

So yeah, not sure if anyone cared for the trip report but there it is, I'll definitely be trying this stuff more (and next time I'll know to just barely heat the spoon hehe)

Cheers!

^haha sounds like you tripped for sure! DPT isn't the sort of compound that is pure eye candy OEVs like the NBOMes/NBOH (not that I've tried them to find out, but this is what I gather), it is more of an introspective/insight kind of trip like what you described.

Seems like I've found the right compound in that case! While I am still going to continue searching for something with great OEV that's more recreational (likely need to just get a connect for legitimate LSD, have only done it once but it blows NBOMe's out of the water), this is definitely what I need for my current purposes. Thanks so much for taking the time to really spell things out for me, I really appreciate your help ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Caveat. Mentioned it before but although converting it to freebase is "easy" I followed the instructions and it didn't work and I lost most of the DPT; what I did get wasn't a wax and was hard to use and did next to nothing; smoking the HCL was easy and it worked brilliantly so I never bothered to risk it again; clearly not a problem if you have access to DPT and can just buy a load more but that wasn't the case for me and I lost some of what little I had which was pretty disheartening.

Well, I fucked up.

Last night I finally got around to taking a proper dose after months of a couple pussyfooting +/- trips and letting it sit in a drawer. Thing is I only went up from 100 to 120mg with a little MXE too and well I went to hell.

I had a complete screaming shit flip. Lots of screaming and begging for death that wouldn't come as I burned a thousand times in the fires of hell. Wife called the emt;s as I was not really able to do anything but scream. The ambulance came and they had to carry me into the ambluance and I spent last night at the hospital. 

I couldn't pee and I thought they were castrating me and I was ok with that but couldn't understand why they were performing traumatic surgery on me while I was awake. I met god, I became a black hole, I was the contageon and bad seed that god sent to end it all. I learned why people pray. I had a ++++ bad trip/religious experience. 


I've never had a drug experiance end with me in the hospital in 20 years of high dose psychs and dissos. I'm sane now but feeling pretty shameful and depressed.

Home now, wife took and disposed of my stash and scales and everything else, and made me promise never again. I'm not sure about never again, but I'm sure about not for quite a while and I'm ok with her tossing it all.

Just thought I would share. Maybe I'll write a proper trip report in the proper location later.

Nasal, ~50mgs MXE (next to nothing with my tolerance, just to ease the jitters), and yeah. I've done a hundred mgs of each before and it was just a fairly normal m hole, so I tried what I did last night not expecting much more than a ++ and well...

So you think the root cause of this was simply that the dose of 120mg was too high for you? Or were there other complex factors that played in?


I've only pushed it up to 60mg. 20mg the other night felt fairly strong to me, with crawling OEVs, trippy headspace and I was compelled to become motionless for a good hour. I don't understand when people talk about this stuff being bunk. Maybe people are stiffing it too hard and getting it in their throats instead of sinuses.

From what I've read it's just one of those drugs that;s very different for different people all requiring different doses. Up till now I really havn't gotten much more than the shakes and some mildly new thought patterns, very mild. 


 I think there might of been other factors. I think my tolerance to psychs which was beastly has lowered as I have not dosed in at least a month, and it's been much  longer since I dosed high on anything other than dissos, so when I worked up to 100mgs and it wasn't doing much, well It might now.I havn't heard of such a steep dosage curve, but maybe it's like 2ce where there is just that tiny window of a couple mg between a hard trip and OMG . .hello God and the devil.


As to why it was such a bad trip I'm not sure. I'm in a pretty good place in my life really and even in the past when I wasn't and everything that I was was slipping away, I was able to hold it together and do what needed to be done as to not scare the people I love. 


If I could of been quiet I could of avoided the hospital but I just couldn't it was just the worst torture that I couldn't even really imagine before, god gets pretty fucked up when he's mad at you. He came several times as a large round reflective black hole of such intense gravity that I just got crushed on his surface later on when I was coming down he became kinder when I prayed,. Very different presentation than any trip I've had.

I'm thankful that my wife doesn't read these forums, but less thankful that I've read that just before my first attempt at DPT.


Sorry for the scare Golem, glad you're ok in the end.

Yes, and she asked me to write down what I took, "just in case." I think I'll actually do that this once. In any case, I'm just going to test the waters (vaporizing, starting with small amounts). Here we go.

The idea of vaporizing is that you bring the chemical up to the point that it boils and vaporizes, but without burning it. So it needs to get hot, but not really really hot. So give it a touch of flame for a moment here and there, but don't roast it. That has worked for me anyways.

Hey perpetual, I'm going to try a second go at converting and vaping, and I just wanted to clarify one thing. When you say that it comes to a point that it boils and vaporizes, should there actually be a visible bubbling of the wax? I think when I actually just kept the flame close to the DPT without weed on top (and after unclogging my bowl which was likely why anything beforehand did very little to nothing), and noticed it slowly bubble away, that was when I got the most out of it. Just want to make sure that's actually what I'm going for and that it didn't just seem to work better for some other reason (remaining residue from previous hits or something like that).

Sorry for posting so damn much, just wanted to say I'm sorry to hear about that experience Golem (a bit for myself, but mainly for you). That sounds incredibly frightening.

Also, when you took 20mg the other night perpetual, what ROA did you use, insufflation like Golem?

I managed to have a bit of a stronger experience than the last, by just 'slow roasting' a big glob of the stuff, allowing it to very slowly bubble away but also drawing strong enough to make sure I get the vapor.

OEV were still mild but more noticeable, mainly a change in depth perception, and CEV's were more introspective (and I used less this time, 25mg) but also had a lot of random stuff going on as well (possibly due to the weed), but I still would be baffled if someone told me they were getting an equivalent on par with Ayahuasca off of this stuff (or at least off of my dose).

So what I'm debating is, next time, just doing my best to meditate away any anxiety and not pussy-foot, and try and vape about 40-50mg all in 1-2 hits, oooor, change my ROA and rail 25mg.

Any input? (Again sorry for double posting)

I have not smoked it yet, but I can tell you for me anyway railing isn't as unpleasant as most reports suggest, a line of speed is infinitely more painful with a more obnoxious drip.  

Is it weird I want to use DPT again? I made some promises so I wont for a long time, but I kinda want to go back and try to look for a resolution.

Yeah I kinda figure a line so small wouldn't be as bad as railing a fat line of mdma, I never really minded the burn so much (except one time I got some super cheap M from a guy and then started finding these strange little plastic-like flakes while crushing it up, holy fuck worst burn ever my eyes would tear up every line) as the drips anyway.


As for wanting to go back, it's not weird it's just how you feel. I think maybe you want to feel a sense of closure before you say goodbye to psychedelics for a long time? Hell I know I was pretty upset when didn't get one last dance with mary jane before quitting, that almost bummed me out more than the thought of actually not smoking for a long time (thankfully in the future I'll be able to smoke infrequently).

I can totally see how you might be in a similar boat (especially considering DPT has thus far proven to be much more rewarding than smoking pot), not being able to at least start the break with a recent positive experience to reflect on is unfortunate. I hope you end up having the willpower to stick with giving it a break regardless though, I won't pretend to know anything about your relationship but I think it's only fair to your wife, even if she hadn't made you promise not to use it again she must have been terrified by the experience as well. That's just my own personal opinion though, hopefully you can find out where it all went wrong through other means (perhaps it just hit you way harder than you expected and you weren't prepared for that?).

Best of luck!

Here's my (non) trip report. I converted 40mg hcl to freebase using the baking soda method (no wash) and vaporized using my old DMT machine. I think I either screwed up in the conversion or my smoking technique was way off. I didn't feel the effects to be particularly psychedelic or intense, at least by 20 minutes, although I liked the body sensations... I finally gave up and smoked some good weed, which admittedly skyrocketed the threshold effects. I felt great, but I was lacking energy for creative projects (which I assumed I'd be up for) and found I didn't know what to do with myself (I suspect that if I had added some MXE to the mix it would have been a different story).


Finally, I admitted to myself that I was actually pretty bored. This is a strange feeling to have on a psychedelic drug (for me anyway)! So I closed my eyes and started meditating. Pretty soon I was seriously buzzing. Finally, I ended in braingasm. You have to understand that I have had braingasms for as long as I can remember; even before experimenting with any drugs. However, this was a pretty spectacular braingasm. "That was nice," I thought. Then I realized that I could just make it happen to myself, quickly, and repeatedly, like never before. Again and again, and stronger and stronger. I could even maintain braingasms that seemed to reverberate to infinity. The energy was highly sexual and felt incredible. Nevertheless I was quite lethargic. (I should mention that I've been somewhat sleep-deprived, so that may play a significant role here.) Eventually, I forced myself to get to bed and lay beside a sleeping wife. When I closed my eyes I found myself getting back into the braingasms. They were so intense that I would convulse at their peaks and worried that I might wake my wife.


Based on everything I've read, I assume that my actual dose was pretty low and I screwed something up. The DPT that I started with is the cleaned up white stuff from the Canadian vendor... I haven't heard that this batch is bunk so I assume that the fault for the threshold effects is mine. I'm going to try again using my Vapor Genie.


As for the conversion, I just followed the instructions given in this thread exactly (40mg + 10mg baking soda + 10 drops water) and it certainly *seemed* to go correctly (dissolved completely and precipitated when the baking soda was added). The only thing I wonder about is that the precipitate was not as oily as I expected. Is the baking soda tek foolproof or is there a way in which it can go wrong? I actually have some NaOH and Naphtha at my disposal, so maybe I should be using a better tek?

I, too, had the "cleaned up"  version and after a couple of  IM injections of it I threw the remaining 1.5 grams in the trash so I could use the baggie for my DMT.


If it's not bunk, then I'm immune.

Sorry to hear about your loss dude. This is also my biggest fear. As DPT is so priceless and hard to get, and since I realise I am no chemist, I am afraid I might screw up the little DPT I have left. I believe I will try the intranasal route next time I get the chance.

IM  injection only ROA  I tried and the only other DPT was the  nasty  red shit from the  same Canadian  vendor...might have been expecting too much...IDK.

I usually dose pretty high when doing...?...anything so maybe it was me.

I did 100mg IM  injection and barely felt anything.

Assuming we're all talking about the same site, I've got the same stuff and can definitely say that I don't find it bunk in the slightest bit, so far mild yes, but I can definitely see that being more due to lack of experience with vaporizing as well as the conversion. I'm going to try insufflating next and I'll post back afterwards. Anyone know how long I should be waiting before I can trip again without tolerance reducing effects?

There's nothing mild about DPT. Something is seriously wrong with what's happening during the experiences of these recent posters. I mean, it's sort of like ... heat ripples through the ego. It's indistinct in the sense that the visuals aren't sharply defined like the way a more selective 5HT2a psychedelic like those of 25C or, maybe, 2C-E are, but your whole sense of self is "rippling," and the visuals do grow in prevalence at higher doses. 


I was PM'd about comparisons and contrasts between high-dose DPT and 5-MeO-DMT, which myself and, apparently, others, have made before. Out of all the psychedelics out there currently, there are empirical indications that 5-MeO and DPT lean heavily on 5HT1a relative to 2a in the way of effects at the neuronal level, though 5-MeO much more so. That may or may not be relevant to my observations about their subjective similarity at higher dosages.  But in my experience both have the effect of making ego boundaries wavy, warped, and dissolute. With DPT the tendency is more toward the less severe wiggly, light-of-consciousness-through-vibrating-jello refraction end of the spectrum of ego dissolution, whereas 5-MeO is more straight up sublimation into vapor. I'm as sure that that will confuse some people as I am that experienced others with a penchant for figurative language will pretty much follow the distinction. Of my four "ego death" experiences, one involved DPT, and another 5-MeO-DMT (in combination with DXM).


Here is an excerpt describing the vision that preceded the DPT experience:


> I was at ground level peering into a shifting field of tall grass in moonlight. Diaphanous tigers crisscrossed my field of vision and wound through the undergrowth, their black stripes transformed into transparent fissures cut clean through their bodies. Then, in one fractional moment, the wind parted the grass and the tiger's ruptured stripes marshaled in line so that I could suddenly see a great distance through both the tigers and the field. That world froze and I flew through the divide and into empty night. Everything turned inside out with a terrible ripping sound and an electric jolt, and I hovered above it as a bare locus hearing my own disbelieving utterances: "that was it!" "this is it!"--yet I provided no impetus to those words. They were the rustle of grass shifting in the wind.

Okay well I certainly can't say I've had anything even close to that, OEV were on par with a low dose of mushrooms at best..I'm not going to say that the DPT is bunk until I've tried insufflation however, I may try it again tomorrow morning (I mean, if that's how intense it's supposed to be then I doubt what I experienced both times is enough to build much of a tolerance) and let you guys know how attempt #3 goes. Either way, I'm not complaining because it's already helped me come to a few very helpful realizations so it's doing it's job, full effects or not.

Psoodonym: Thanks for the comparisons vs. 5-MeO-DMT, I've been really curious about that because they seem very similar. 


I've not tried 5-MeO-DMT, still not sure if I will either, because it seems to overlap with DPT so much. Both of these drugs seem to be very trippy, deep, introspective, heavy-duty, powerful. My question is: for someone who has lots of territory left to explore within DPT, and who really likes DPT, do you think it's worth checking out 5-MeO-DMT as well?


Stranglerfish: Insuflation is my preffered ROA for DPT, and I recommend it. Smoking/vaping sucks IMO, except for the very useful short duration, and lack of pain and nasal drip. When you sniff it, make sure you do so very gently. You are trying to get the powder to sit in your sinuses, and the powder is very light so it can be easy to over-sniff. It hurts a bit, but you'll get over it. Try not to swallow the loogie that will form in your sinus, you want the drug to absorb through your sinuses. 


Insuflating it has given me the most powerful trips. For me, 20mg is effective, 30mg is starting to get heavy, 60mg is mind-blowing. I want to try 80mg when I'm ready. But the doses are apparently different for everyone. If you've missed it check out the erowid DPT primer: [https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dpt/dpt_primer.shtml](https://www.erowid.org/chemicals/dpt/dpt_primer.shtml) He recommends for your first time do 25mg first, then if in 15-30mins you feel like you want to go higher, boost *once* with another 25mg. This is good advice. Measure your doses out beforehand, trying to fiddle with a scale whilst tripping ballz is something you don't need to subject yourself to.

5MeO is sort of nitrous like in that it's the same relative experience each time, but I don't feel it and DPT have a lot in common beyond the way they shred the ego during high dose experiences.  5-MeO-DMT, at least when vaporized, is of another order in comparison to every other psychedelic I know of. If you happen to be among those who react in a deeply meaningful way to it then it was worth seeking out. But you can't know whether or not that's you until you try it.

Damn - I was hoping I could cross 5-MeO-DMT off my list of PDs to try.. now you've just piqued my curiosity. 


Would you say 5-MeO-DMT shares more in common with DPT than it does with other tryptamines, or is it a completely different space?

5-MeO-DMT is its own beast. Insofar as such comparisons can be made, more sets it apart from the rest of the pack than most any other that's had success on the market.

Perfect, yeah I have read the erowid bit about 25 then additional 25 depending, I think another issue I had with vaporizing was that I was sort of applying that, so instead of trying to take one big hit of a 40mg glob of the freebase, I was adding bit by bit. I'm going for a nice productive day today so I've decided to wait a bit before trying the DPT again (finally fixed my sleeping schedule and starting to have breakfast for the first time in years, yes!), but I'll definitely be giving it another go sometime soon, within the week hopefully! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks for all your help :D

Yes, after another vaporization attempt I'm suspecting that what the vendor sent was simply not DPT. Scary. I may send it out for analysis (somewhere.. never done that before).

I hope this it's okay for me to ask this...the vendor you got your DPT from, does it go by the initials 'BCD'? That is where I got mine, and mine is also basically white (sliiiightly off-white).

Also, is vaporization the only ROA you have attempted so far? I think it's important that we remember that dosage varies for everyone, I hope for us it's a case of either improper technique or not a strong enough dose, as I did end up ordering more after my second attempt :s

yeah...BCD...I threw mine away after two failed IM attempts, so i'll never know if I was premature or not.

I've ceased to use them as a source though...after some shitty MET and DPT...it was red...looked like MHRB and smelled of DMT...trashed it too.

The 99% "pure" DPT was free so I took it, only to trash it too.

Iam going to get some more DPT though, through another source of course,...it seems to have potential...especially since  my preferred ROA is parenteral.

I don't think you'll find "better" DPT than the stuff coming from the quebec connection phuckingnutz. I wonder if you just have extremely high tolerance to psychedelics, or maybe DPT just doesn't work for you? Or maybe you have some expectation of DPT to be in the realm of the same potency as some of the subbed tryptamines, like 4-AcO-DMT? 100mg of DPT shouldn't be anywhere close to the power of 100mg 4-AcO-DMT.


DPT needs a pretty big dose compared to the 4 and 5 subs, but it can take you far. As far as I can tell, and after comparing my multiple trials to the reports at similar doses from others on the web, there's nothing wrong with the pure white batch, and even the cinnamon brown batch was pretty good (but extra foul smelling).


Or maybe it can't take someone like you far phuckingnutz! After reading about some of the doses you've consumed, I can see that you might have pretty high expectations/tolerance/ability to trip hard. I don't mean that in a congratulatory way nor in a critical way, just observing.

I got mine from them too as a replacement and 100mg nasally had me holding on to the couch for dear life for a lil while and I consider myself a hardhead to Tryptamines (having had some question my high dosing here at BL)   So I think that "new" batch of québécois DPT potent as fuck!

I think you might have an extreme tolorance to DPT maybe.

Hell, 200mg of that stuff even worked shockingly well for me orally!

Of course the fault could have been my smoking technique, but my fear is that, if it's potent when insufflated, but not when vaporized, that perhaps it's not DPT. Maybe it's actually 4-ho-dpt (which that vendor happens to offer as well)... Anyway, sorry for the speculation, I'll get to the bottom of this. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

This chemical is amazing. 50mgs sniffed had my mind, body, soul, ego, shimmering/ humming/vibrating. This was on top of some DOC, next time I think I will go for the full 100mgs.

Going straight from 50mg to 100mg seems like a big leap, especially if you found 50mg to be strong, and especially after reading GolemGolem's harrowing experience on the previous page when he went up by 20mg.


Maybe try 80mg first? Or 80mg + 20mg after 20mins or whatever.

100mgs may be a big leap but while 50mgs was indeed strong, it was insanely pleasant which caused me to repeat the experience twice within several hours. The DOC may have forced a relaxed mindstate mabey. Either way I enjoyed myself very much, dpt and I have a very bright future ahead of us![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

Maybe it's actually 4-ho-dpt (which that vendor happens to offer as well)...

Doubtfull, 4-ho-dpt is one of the very rarest RC's and that vendor in question had it stocked for about 48 hours before it sold out. It's been listed as out of stock ever since (I should know, I bought most of his stock). If DPT is potent nasally but not vaporized then it's been degraded in your freebase conversion or your vaping technique is off.

Mine was quite white and fluffy, sourced domestically, but who knows where he got his from. 


Just wanted to babel on about some of the less scary experiences as I was coming down. Once at the hospital and the doctors changed at different points to aliens with exposed rainbow veins who felt very cold and distant, Military and I was at gitmo being harshly interrogated in a bright white room while explosions could be heard in the distance (the Chinese had adulterated the MXE see, and now I was a bio bomb, I wanted them to get the bomb squad to detonate me someplace safe, but they wouldn't listen and I was scared for them), and finally David Ickle brand reptilians who decided to save the military for their own reasons. They castrated me because thats where the contageon was, but they were going to keep my balls and use it themselves (or as it turned out cathed me, I was quite surprised when I came down further and found out I still had my junk). 

Then just tripping hard but being more or less with it and able to give more complex answers not in the form of poetry pleading and curses. 

Kinda neat that I went through three classic paranoid fantasies in short succession, none of which I've had before. That it was focused on the doctors, as I felt warm towards the nurses, before one more big surge and another visit by god as black hole, then a bunch of IV xanax (you know, once it really wasn't needed anymore) and I go blank for a bit wake up again that night and I'm sane. 


Also kind of surprised I went through that and I'm not any more mentally unwell, or well for that matter, that other than my girl and the bills and the no moar stash things everything is very, very normal. Little more god fearing....but normal.

I've tried converting my DPT HCL to freebase form on 3 separate occasions now. The first two I ended up just trying to sandwich it in between some weed and use a cigarette lighter to vaporize, but neither really did much. Like, practically no OEV except for practically unnoticeable waviness/morphing (so incredibly minute), and the CEV was only useful one of the times and the introspection was quite forced, turned out to not really be much of a trip but more imagination slightly enhanced by I suppose a microdose.

Just got back from a festival where a friend offered to smoke me on DMT if I could find a freebase pipe, which I did but then I couldn't find him afterwards. So when I got home I decided I would instead use the pipe for DPT.

So, attempt #3, I added 50mg of DPT to a spoon, then 11-12 drops of water, gently heated the spoon with breaks to stir until the DPT dissolved, and then I added 12mg of baking soda. I stirred that quite well and then put it near my heater for about 10 minutes until the water had evaporated. What was left was the same as usual, but this time I dried it out so it would be less damp.

First of all, that stuff is a bitch to scoop into the pipe, I use the little tweezers that came with my scale but man is it ever sticky. What do you guys use to work with DPT?

Second, even after vaporizing half of the stuff, I felt veeeery little, just a slight sensation in the body of something coming on. So I vaporized the rest, and then the sensation definitely increased but at no point where any OEV produced whatsoever even after vaporizing 50mg which I've heard is enough to be intense for mostly anyone. I did notice that 6-7 hits of LSD over the course of about 3-4 hours (initially 2-3, then another 2 about an hour later, the rest at T+4) also produced practically no visuals, which I had blamed on the fact that I'd taken 4-aco-met the night before and likely was due to tolerance. Does it make sense that the DPT was almost completely nullified by such a tolerance?


I'm trying to determine what could be going wrong, as I would like to avoid insufflation if possible, but I also would like to stop wasting DPT.

I'm thinking it's either something is going wrong in the conversion process, maybe heating the spoon too much, I'm not vaporizing it properly, or it's tolerance, though I suspect something labelled Damn Powerful Tryptamine should still produce at least some noticeable effect, especially since none of the drugs I did all weekend at the festival I was at ever produced a powerful trip it was always mild. (The drugs were 4-aco-met friday, LSD Saturday and a bit more 4-aco-met at the end of the night when I realized how mild the whole trip was, and some shrooms on Sunday)


What do you guys think?

Its about dissolving DPT in propylene glycol and using it as a nasal spray. I'd love to know if this worked for anyone else!

^^ I think you must be a hard head. Wow, 6-7 hits of acid didn't do anything for you. If its typical acid that would be enough to send most people to the moon and back. The 4-aco-met the day before would definitely give you tolerance too. 


If you want to keep trying DPT do it after you've had a break from PDs. don't combine it with alchohol. Are you on any meds? Maybe try sniffing it, seems more reliable than smoking. Try upping your dose a bit. Don't look for fireworks, I don't think this is the substance for visual eye candy.

Well I'm certainly not nearly as experienced with LSD as most, I've only taken clean stuff twice, the 6-7 hits being my second time. I think the issue is that I tend to require a higher dose of tryptamines than others, I remember when I got my 4-aco-dmt and some were saying 10mg is a comfortable starting point but I got literally nothing when experimenting below 20mg, had to take 25mg to finally have a decent and shortlived trip on it.

Not on any meds either. It's been about 4-5 days since I took 1mg of 25i-NBOH, gonna wait a couple more days and try again.

I just came down from a session of 40mg DPT(insufflated) + MXE. When they say duration is 2-4 hours, with the way time ripples at that level it feels more like 2-4 lifetimes, damn good lifetimes though to be sure, at least from these eyes.

This stuff is so sacred. I wish I had words for it. 

 I listened to FLAC of Erothyme - Circadia it is a very doable trip for DPT!

Still thinking about that trip last night, maybe the most intense trip of my life. Literally it was hours of non-stop the most intense next-level psychedlia I've ever experienced. I can't imagine doing anything but listening to music in dark room in bed on DPT. Its too intense for anything else, and the body needs to remain relativiely still for it to reach the full potential. I imagine the physicality of the space-time warping is not especially healthy on the internal organs if the flow is broken too much. I feel like it is important to stay with it or it can turn to be a hard experience. Serious repurcussions if not respectful of the spirit. 


Spooky' is a word that is used a lot to describe the trip, like spooky how it takes your breath, the lucidity of the nth dimensional fabric unfolding, spooky how sound transforms space-time, the synesthesia is far beyond all other tryps. It puts LSD to shame for sure. It is straight to the point, like as close as one can get to the event horizon of the singularity without getting sucked in entirely. 


The comparison to DMT is fair if only because that's the only other thing that comes close to the power of DPT.

^ I can really relate to everything you're saying here. On a good dose of DPT (60mg + a tiny bit of ketamine to aid with muscular tension, like 5mg or something). I did't feel like I should move around or even sit up at all - DPT seems to best experienced lying flat on your back, listening to music, perfectly still, breathing and that's about it. Extreme time dilation, an album lasts for an eternity. It is spooky, like you said, not in a way that things are scary, more like you unite with the spookiness, the holy ghost and the grim reaper. 


And I too felt like it took me to peer just beyond the even horizon, the infinite void that sits between moments. Fractal soundwaves, synaesthesia, yup. 


It's a pretty interesting drug. It's not "fun" at all, but it's damn interesting, rewarding, mind-opening and revealing.

It's a bit painful at first, like a quick burn, not too bad though, nothing to ruin a trip or anything. I've never snorted meth and plan on never doing so. It's about as painful as K I'd say, but it has a bit of a foul aroma as well. The DPT I've had is such a light powder that you have to be careful to snort it very gently. If you snort too hard it would just end up in your throat or lungs. It's also a challenge to avoid the temptation to swallow the DPT loogie that ends up in your sinus. I think if you don't let the DPT just sit there in your sinuses, the effects would diminish.

Great analogy for DPT.  I had always said I understood the lyrics "the forces tear loose from the axis" in the Dead song Dark Star after DPT.  Strong stuff.  That center that makes us who we are can spin off into orbit or it seems.  35 mgs is borderline too much for me, and I can take heroic doses of most things.  I did 50 mgs once and had to ride it out the first hour, but then when I came through the other side I felt great and enjoyed the rest trip and had a great afterglow for a week or two.  Like dying and coming  back. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  It's been a few years, but maybe should revisit.

Yes the duality is intense. When the movement of a song reaches the end of a cycle, the dying, and then a new cycle beginning out of the void, the juxtaposition is intense! I was on the edge of a tear forming as far as it would go without welling up from my eye and falling out, salivating the point of where it form around me and then be reabsorbed with every wave of the energy. And all of time space had the same feeling, waves of space would curl within before the wave would actually arrive without.


Edit: I I know that these words are on the verge of nonsense, but I don't have any other way to describe it. Once again 'spooky' comes to mind as the word for having seen things that can not be seen.

Well, for me, DPT is like a crossover between 5-MeO-DMT and LSD. So if you rate DPT above LSD, I assume you will appreciate 5-MeO-DMT as well.

Your description of DPT being at something like a midpoint between 5-MeO-DMT and LSD has me both intrigued and intimidated (to explore 5-MeO-DMT)


I don't think I'd rate anything above LSD ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Nonetheless, I think DPT has a very special purpose that I really appreciate. Something along the lines of completely non-recreational, cathartic, contemplate your own mortality, psychedelic growth sessions. Sounds like 5-MeO-DMT is further along on that "difficulty" axis, and I hear a lot of people describing the fear/terror aspect of it.

Always hard to put psychedelic experiences into words, especially when they get into that abstract realm. Totally worth the effort though...

DPT sounds wonderful! I'm thinking about getting 500mg of DPT and splitting it with a friend.


I'm taking 250mg orally, since I don't really like snorting stuff, and money isn't a problem for me anyway.


What should I expect from this? I was thinking it probably should give me a ++++ experience, lasting at least 2 hours. 


Also, from what I've read, DPT sounds like a great psychedelic to be used on top of longer lasting psychedelics.

What would be the best time to dose, then? I'm intrigued by the guy who used it on top of a DOC trip!

I put it up there with some of the most painful things I've ever snorted.  Only substance that has ever given me nose bleeds after one use. The drip was bad enough that it bothered me for the entire trip the two times I snorted it.  It would instantly burn my nose bad and plug it completely up.


That said I've only ever had one batch of it so for all I know it might have been contaminated with something.  


I want to try it again but the act of snorting it really turns me off.

Is the body load so tense and uncomfortable that it is easy to get distracted from the trip or on a solid dose are you just fuckin in it so deep you cant really think about your body. 

When taking any drug especially psychedelics I always get the worst of the negative side effects possible ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png) lol. Would a nice dose of benzos before dosing be any good at easing the tension. 


Im thinking of starting with 25mg IM.

It was supposed to be Hcl but it could have been either.  I've had vendor mix ups before with such things.  I never tried to freebase it or anything so I'm not 100% certain what it was.

I think benzos will just dull the trip. I've mixed my DPT with a little bit of ketamine, which helped with body load (or at least disassociate from it!), and does not oppose the psychedelic-ness. 


I find that DPT can cause some muscle tension, particularly in my neck, spine, shoulders. Sometimes I feel as though my neck or back is on the verge of tweaking and that if I turn my head the wrong way, or let my posture get sloppy that I'll throw it out. I often end up just lying down for the peak to fully relax as it's too much work to stay aligned etc sitting or standing up. DPT usually brings me to the ground when it gets heavy lol.

Thanks for the quick and detailed response. Still wondering though, from what I read a big dose IM will have lots of muscle tension mabye some muscle spasms, but at a very high dose are you just so engulfed in the experience (say im laying on my back in bed) that your body is merely an afterthought? 


Like with me and DMT, I can notice the body load, especially if I try to move, but with a big dose im just so deep in the trip im usually laying down, eyes closed, taking it all in and not really even aware that I have a body, just a mind. if that makes sense.

I wouldn't call the body vibrations an afterthought. It is different than DMT in that your whole body is riding a hyperdimensional wave rather than just your mind.  Don't be afraid of it, just ride the wave, stay afloat and you'll be dandy as a lion.

Ahh thanks vortech. Thats really exactly what I needed to hear. Sometimes I psych myself out haha, but im sure it will be a awe inspiring event.  Less then two weeks till blast off!


also have an amazing painting my sister did that just totally represents the DMT/DPT experience. ill save that for the top of page 5 ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

well I took a total of around 110mg DPT and 100 mg MXE last night, all plugged except an initial dose of 25mg mxe taken orally. Capped it off with 50mg DMT at the tail end. 


DPT and mxe were lovely. Nothing like I remembered for the DPT, then again I wasn't smoking marijuana this time and I feel that makes a big difference. DMT was perhaps one of he most terrifying experiences of my life. To the point that I immediatly forgot it. I took notes, bits and pieces remain. The summation is, don't ask for the truth of reality/existance because it just might not be what you are wanting or expecting. I realized I had been at that experience many times before, and continue to forget because otherwise this game we call life/existance/reality isn't worth playing. It was unlike any DMT report I can ever recall reading... I am honesly still at a loss as to describe it. No entities, no elves, no nothing. Just an immediate dissapearance of the veil seperating this reality. I have never really wanted a trip sitter before, but I am not sure I would do DMT again without one. A voice not my own encouraging me to go with it and that it would end might have done wonders to me gaining more from this experience.


THe ironic/fucked thing is I woke up with he desire to go back and try again. from what truly is, and the most abjectly terrifying exposure to "truth" I can imagine. 


I will hopefully write up a full report in the next few days. THe DPT aspect is definaly worth sharing as well. I wouldn't classify it as "cold", but neutral. Allowed me to see my faults and things I need to work on (which is waht I asked for). I accepted them and contemplated how to live my day to day life better instead of running and hiding from them. I can see how it could have been a more "negative" experience if my attitude had been different.

ive received some DPT from that canadian vendor.


Ive tested the water with 10mg insufflated.


I was surprise by how strong it is/was 

10mg is equivalent to 1 g of shroom


I can understand the spookyness description. I have had leg tremor of sort, but nothing alarming. its like a shaky sensation all over the body. it feels as if it adds to the experience


the drip is indeed sour and disgusting but after 40 minute, I dont really taste it anymore..


Will try 20mg real soon!


Music is definitely enhanced. so far, I really like the overall mood. When it peaked, I was really surprise by how relatively strong it was for only 10mg. Already, I can see a lot of utility in low dose. 10 mg is a definite +2 and makes music sounds amazing and also good mood lifter. its a small trip even at 10mg, its not totally underwhelming like most low dose tryptamine for me.

Have there been any more reports of seizures from DPT other then the one on erowid? I did a high dose, snorted 100-200 mg (ik don't eyeball research chemicals I learned my lesson about that for about 45 very long minutes). The tremors and muscle spasms were quite pronounced and very unenjoyable however I had lifted that day so was quite sore and tense already. Now about the trip, it felt like right before a breakthrough I spent the entire peak (which hit in less than 5 mins snorting) on the edge of the void is what it felt like. I wasn't fighting it either was in a good set and setting with calming music but it was just too strong body and mind wise. Can one breakthrough on DPT like DMT, if not smoked? Sorry for all the questions and if this seems nonsensical still coming down.


Edit: Also I don't really get the spookiness everyone keeps talking about for me 5-meo-dmt snorted had a much darker almost menacing edge to the trip. The drips and burns don't compare either, I would never snort 5-meo-dmt again the pain from that only compares to bk-2cb which is was a whole lot more substance.

A short while back I came across an excellent deal on much DPT, so I snatched that up of course. I wasted quite a bit experimenting with freebase conversion and proper amounts to lace onto inert herb, but I got the hang of it. I also purchased a BHO vaporizer pen, and now I can concentrate an enormous amount of DPT freebase in a very smooth and small rip (so that's pretty cool).


Anyhow, this all has obviously given me plenty of experience with the chemical, and I can certainly see why there is ritual use. 


However, I find DPT lacking in visuals.


I'm considering adding moclobemide beforehand.. Any experience combining DPT with an MAOI?

(By the way, any consensus as to whether or not an herb that naturally inhibits monoamine oxidase, say for example Passionflower, would activate the simple tryptamine or not?)


Oh, and once, while high on MXE and laying on my floor in dark silence, I decided to hit a very large amount of the freebase DPT.  It was weird, because I felt pretty normal, but as I lay there unthinking, I realized I could hear a few men speaking. It sounded as if they were in my bathroom.  They were saying some off the wall shit, it was pretty whacky.

20mg plugged feels exactly like 20mg nasal, but theres no tremor and no spasm when plugged.


I wonder why plugging is not the most recommended ROA. intranasal is terrible for me but when plugged, dpt is very useful for me..

Id say that 20mg intranasal is equivalent to 27mg plugged. Plugging is a very good ROA and you avoid the tremors and the nose clogs. The effect is a bit different when plugged compared to nasal. I was actually over with dpt as I found the nasal administration way to problematic. but now with plugged, I find DPT very special


I find low dose of DPT very great for music enhancement and is replacing weed for me. 20mg plugged is enough to really bring depht to music while retaining very clear minded and almost sober but with heightened senses. the other great benefit is its short action. within 2.5 hours of plugging, I can sleep.

^ Murph do you find that you can sleep more quickly after plugging DPT, than if you had sniffed it? I would never be able to sleep 2.5h after sniffing DPT.


I think when you sniff it, some of it gets absorbed right away, but some of it just sits there clogged in the mucous and ends up slowly dissipating across the sinus membranes. I find that if I snort DPT it ends up keeping me up and on edge for a really long time, at least 4h after. I've thought about doing a sinus flush with salt water once the DPT peaks, to get all the residue out, but that can be hard to negotiate while tripping. Maybe I'll try plugging. 


DPT is such a strange beast. My experiences have not been fun in any conventional way, and there are very few people I'd recommend it to. But I keep coming back to it, I like it. It's an intriguing substance.


I agree with the above about low dose DPT being great for music enhancement. A recent 13mg nasally was an incredible way to experience some brand new tunes. 


I was really surprised at how strong 13mg was this most recent time. I wouldn't have wanted to be in public at all.

hi, yes, dpt plugged is very fast ending. after 3h, everyone should be able to sleep

I personally dislike high dosage of dpt, but at low to medium, I find dpt very fun. one of the few RC I will rebatch!

Finally got around to trying some of the DPT that I've been holding onto for over a year now. I was planning on snorting some, but I'm currently pretty congested so I went for the oral route instead. I know it's not economical but I have half a gram and didn't mind using a lot for the first experience. 


First I did a 25mg line of MXE (I know I just said I was congested, but a bump like this seemed easier to hoover, and good MXE is always very painless and clean in the nose) to relax me. I wanted to ease some of the pre-flight jitters and also make any negative bodyload less noticeable. 


Almost immediately after I ate 200mg of DPT in a capsule, and watched TV to pass the time. It came on fast -- first effects in 15-20 minutes. In half an hour or less I had to turn off the TV. I turned on Balam Acab's album Wander/Wonder (highly recommended), which I had picked out beforehand but changed once the trip started getting intense. Music was noticeably distorted around the peak. 


It felt like I was on the very edge of breaking through. My whole body was vibrating intensely. My vision was shaking with visuals, so much that during the comeup and peak it was hard to keep my eyes open. With my eyes closed, the visuals were dark and blurry moving geometric shapes. 


I was pretty at peace the whole time. Even as I felt myself rocketing off into space there was minimal anxiety. I had the idea that I might experience ego death and accepted it. I'm not sure if this was due to the nature of the drug or the MXE. 


The next time I try this, I want to break through. This trip was kind of a tease; I felt like the drug was taunting me with what it could offer. 

I am going to try the nasal route next time. I'm thinking 75mg.

Vaping eh? Didn't know that worked. Who has experience with that ROA and what is a dose, like comparable to 20mg insufflated? 


I definitely agree that it is much more recreational at lower doses. Even 10 mg, combined with and small to medium dose of MXE greatly enhances the state of mind, and feels quite nice on the body too. Higher doses like 40mg is visionary but too intense for me to want to revisit soon.

I ended up trying DPT two times a while back and thought it was incredible, though the second time was much more jarring than the first. I received some tan colored powder, and it was definitely not from a Canadian vendor. First time I snorted 20 mg while being buzzed on alcohol. I got the idea to do it while I was pretty drunk, but I intentionally waited about an hour and a half for the buzz to die down before trying it, just to be a little safer. After taking in the 20 mg, I got an incredibly pleasurable body high and the visuals started. I ended up snorting another 40 mg across the night and the visuals got very intense but not quite overwhelming and the body high felt completely orgasmic. I found myself sitting on the floor grinning stupidly and staring at the incredible fractal patterns emerging out of my otherwise uninteresting carpet. I ended up getting in bed and falling asleep to trip hop in utter bliss. I would say the trip ended within 2 hours of getting in bed.


Second time I snorted 30 mg without the alcohol, and this was noticeably different. My girlfriend did it with me this time. It felt noticeably colder and more sinister, and I found it initially unpleasant. It started to get pretty intense, and my body felt like it was being wrapped/coiled up in something and constricted tightly (not vasoconstriction, just a weird psychedelic feeling). We ended up putting on some music and just cuddling on the couch and it eventually eased into something quite pleasant and introspective. The visuals were very similar to the first time, though maybe not quite as intense.


DPT is truly an interesting compound, IMO. I've never done DMT so I can't compare it, but regardless, I would say DPT is a winner for me. I'm not sure when I'll be doing it again though, just because there are so many things on my list, and I try to not do these kinds of things *too* frequently, lol. And I would conclude that DPT can be an incredibly pleasurable high if you combine it with something relaxing (e.g. small amount of alcohol or a benzo--with the benzo probably being the safer option), but on its own it does not seem quite as recreational and is more of a deep, introspective, and sometimes unpleasant psychedelic.

I've vaped it lots, but always pretty small amounts, probably 5-10mg max. From what I remember, it hits within seconds, builds up over a couple of minutes and lasts about and hour. I don't really like this ROA any more, it sketches me out. I get the feeling that it's really bad for my body and it tastes super weird. Too bad because it's a perfect duration for having a nice short trip, kind of unique among 5ht psychedelics.

^ totally agree, the HCl is nasty on the lungs, freebase feels much kinder. It's extremely easy to convert HCl to freebase (using baking soda method), so anyone wanting to vape DPT should be encouraged to freebase it.


Still weirds me out though, and I don't love the ROA - the taste and this gut instinct that DPT vapour is unhealthy on my lungs makes me choose to sniff it instead.

How stable is the hcl?  I bought a gram last year and was gifted a gram this year. The two look exactly the same and 50mgs of the older batch mixed with some mxe seemed pretty damn potent. Is it safe to assume the hcl is pretty stable?

It's pretty stable as far as I know. I've had some for over a year at room temp and it maintained its potency. I recently just stuck it in the freezer though because I don't plan on utilizing it any time in the near future.

Yes it seems quite stable, I've had some hcl at room temp for a year in a baggie (as an experiment) and no apparent loss of potency. 12mg of this seemed just as strong as a year earlier.


I thought I posted on this earlier but I guess it didn't work.

No exp with oral, but you do seem to need a lot more. Plugging it works wonderfully though at about the same dose as insulfated.

based on the dumb DPT overdose i had earlier this year (was on a bunch of DXM and misread my scale, thought the pile looked so big because of dissociative-induced size/perception distortions), it being a K-opiod agonist does not surprise me.


dose was probably like 250mg-300mg or so, insufflated, btw.


lack of 5HT-3 binding surprises me, though, because DPT usually does make me pretty nauseous, even at appropriate sized dosages.

^^ I would be hesitant to trust that chart immediately. The video it came from explicitly said that it was only binding data, not proof of activity. It also said it came from the PDSP, but that data is directly contradicted by DPT PDSP binding data that was released publicly the same year, a link to which can be found at the bottom of [this study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009019). Just looking back and forth between them, everything looks to be pretty much the same except for the fact that the raw data shows that DPT has activity at D2 (absent from the above chart) but not at kappa-opioid receptors. Granted, the study didn't account for anything >10,000 nM affinity, and DPT's 5-HT2A affinity is already 2,579 nM, so technically, just being above 10,000 doesn't necessarily mean that it can't be reached by what would be considered normal doses of DPT if you need to go over a quarter of that just to get psychedelic effects at all, but the fact that the data suggests that it would be more active at least at D2 than kappa-opioid receptors, whereas that chart suggests the exact opposite, kind of at least calls some things into question if you ask me. My guess would be that whoever made that chart was just making a more easily understandable representation of that exact data and flubbed a couple of things....

That is nice lol. I don't mean to suggest that the whole chart is not trustworthy by the way, I would just question the kappa-opioid thing.... Everything else matches up nicely to the raw data they've provided. Probably just a slip up?

If you like psychedelics, this is the queen bee. Some trips are almost generic psychedelia. Other take tangents in the psychedelic headspace that are so genuinely unique that no psych can compare. I swear. That trip where I stared into the mirror on DPT is the most mind blowing I've ever had. I was tuned into a firehose of information so otherworldly yet so personal it left me in true awe. For days. I don't know anything about convulsions on DPT, but this one time my breathing got really rhythmic and intense and I seemed I couldn't stop. I got strangely lightheaded and felt I was going to faint. Kept breathing the same rhythm until there was just a sliver of perception left at the very top of my head, the rest of me felt like it was submerged in an infinite blackness. I struggled to maintain that sliver of awareness while the rest of me was in nothingness. It was terror and resignation. Felt like I was fighting for my life though no harm would come to me. There's better psychs for starters, but this is a psych of true potentiality that affecionados will seek out.

large doses can be extremely intense.  low doses (sub 20mg) can actually be pretty relaxing.

def not too intense actually can be very enjoyable. I will say it is hit or miss though  I've had experiences that remind me of LSD jus shorter duration and had tremors for an hour then felt great or jus no more than mild even at high doses tolerance and ssri/snri use can dampen the trip so who knows i was on trazodone for awhile and that is a 5ht2a antagonist so maybe too much left in system

Plugging is easy as shit, man. I would definitely not recommend trying to inject if you've never done it before, there's so many more risks for complications than plugging.

Had some come thru town awhile back, lasts longer than DMT with few visuals. Also seems to make you really shaky after smoking, would prefer reals deems anyday.

DPT is awesome stuff. I've had about 10 experiences with it. My only complaint is the fucking drip - it literally smells/tastes like shit. I am NEVER snorting it again.

It also said it came from the PDSP, but that data is directly contradicted by DPT PDSP binding data that was released publicly the same year, a link to which can be found at the bottom of [this study](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009019). Just looking back and forth between them, everything looks to be pretty much the same except for the fact that the raw data shows that DPT has activity at D2 (absent from the above chart) but not at kappa-opioid receptors.

Hmmm, I always thought DPT had something that reminded me of Salvia just a little.  I  know the chart and data are in question, but it has crossed my mind and I could not put my finger on it.  So that part stuck out for me.  It is similar to how mescaline reminds me of MDMA a bit.


Who knows, it is interesting though to see what buttons these substances are pushing in the brain, and then the mind.

DPT is probably the dirtiest psychedelic I've ever taken (besides morning glory seeds), this shit just feels gross & wrong...while I never freaked out any of the times I used it or even felt explicitly "bad", the trip is just really awkward, the body load, headspace, even the visuals are just...not right, ugly even. The kappa opioid receptor thing makes a lot of sense to me, DPT shares some of the delirious & physically discomforting aspects of salvia, although salvia's much more vile. Based on what I've read about the Temple of the True Inner Light, it makes a lot of sense that this would be the psychedelic they use as a sacrament, because that churches ideology sure as hell doesn't match up with the vibes of any of the good psychedelics, not even close...

DPT is my favorite psychedelic. There is even a religion that uses it as their sacrament, and I don't think they could have chosen anything much better myself.

I read in Tihkal that it is a lot more like 5-meo-dmt when used orally. They did not seem to like that, but I think I will!


I'll let everyone know what I think about oral vs. nasal/plugged/IM'd/IV'd after I try it. A long time ago, I IV'd 70mg of the stuff. But I do not intend to IV it in the future.


Hey, psilocybin-dream, it seems like we have much different tastes in psychedelics. DPT and Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds were the best ones for me, but DPT doesn't make me feel sick. And I love salvia too!

That's funny haha, well it's a good thing there are so many different psychedelics & other hallucinogens so everyone can find their niche! I personally tend to prefer things to be ecstatic/stimulating (actually not into empathogens though, just "full" psychedelics), DOC & LSD are perfect for my tastes. DPT's headspace was kind of similar to LSD some of the times I did it I remember, but less "light", less beautiful & positive.

I really hope I don't get tremors from this stuff since I'm going to acquire 5 grams in a months time.  Makes me think of robotussin shakes fuck that shit.  I think I'll start out with a 40mg dose so I'm not completely underwhelmed

Recently experimented with both IM and IV ROAs, 30mg IM, 20mg IV. Didn't experience the tremors, where I did feel them on 40mg intranasal. But to be fair the both of those trips were less intense overall than the 40mg intranasal, so I can't say for sure if the direct ROAs reduce the tremors. The best way though IME to make the experience more comfortable and amplify the trip is to combine with MXE (I bet Ketamine would work great too, but the cool thing with MXE is that it has the same duration as DPT).

Anybody tried combining with DXM? I really want to try it with a dissociative, but I don't know if DXM would be safe to mix with DPT. But DXM gives me these interesting visuals like flying over mountains covered in forests and screens full of mathematical formulas and data tables that float across my field of vision. 


Maybe I'll just get some MXP or 3-meo-pcp to mix with it. I'd get MXE, but I don't have any good sources for that. At least none I have tried, and I don't want to lose my money since I don't have much to begin with. 3-meo-pcp is probably better than MXP, it was as good or better than MXE so that might be a better choice of dissociative than MXP.

You are right. Alexander Shulgin was like the god of psychedelic drug design, so many things any tripper can find things they love. DOC and LSD are a couple of my favorites too. But for me, DPT is better. But it seems to have a pretty wide range of effects depending on the person. I'd love me some psilocybin/mushrooms though. Been so long...

My favourite DPT trip so far was when I combined 60mg with a tiny amount of ketamine. I don't particularly trust or enjoy ketamine on it's own, but just a little bit mixed in with the DPT was really good for dissipating the negative physical effects of DPT. I forgot to take a note of how much I used, but it was about 6-10mg ketamine if I remember correctly - subthreshold. It seemed just right for not colouring the trip with K much at all, but still removing the bad parts of DPT.

i've combined it with DXM and with 3-MeO-PCP.  both felt safe, but combining it with DXM was the more enjoyable of the two combos.  MXE + DPT being even more enjoyable than either of those two.


i can't remember if i ever combined DPT with MXP.  i had both at the same time.  seems like i did?  but i really don't remember.  wasn't overly noteworthy if i did, but then MXP never really did much for me.

To add to the dissociatives + DPT discussion: 


I've only tried DPT once, and I was very nervous about it (surprise surprise). To alleviate some of the pre-flight jitters, I snorted around 25mg MXE. As someone who is very experienced with the chem, that was just enough to make me feel less anxious. I am interested what a larger dose of MXE would be like in combo with DPT ::![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I've also combined MXE and DPT. I don't recall the doses, however it seems that it was a low dose of DPT insufflated and a higher dose maybe 50mg or so of MXE. I ended up pretty sedated and just laying in bed for the trip. Highly realistic but very dream like visions if I can recall. Like a psychedelic breakthrough but too sedated to fully grasp the visions and meanings, so it was more like a dream. Kind of surprising how sedating it was because neither of them on their own are sedating. Maybe I had been drinking too or something, I don't recall though since it was over a year ago.

MXE and DPT go very well together.  in general for me i preferred a larger relative dose of MXE with a medium sized dose of DPT added.  you want more MXE than DPT to smooth out the rough physical jitters DPT gives.

This guy above me is right. I dosed 25mg mxe and 50-55mg dpt plugged Friday night. Spent a good bit of time meditating beforehand. Setting intention, which is something I have been neglecting before tripping recently. Lasted about ten minutes after plugging dpt before I felt too jittery and weird. Plugged another 30-40mg mxe, laid in bed, put on my go to trip music, and received exactly what I asked for.


And I can't remember any of it... Lol. Like literally as soon as the dpt starts winding down I already forgot everything. I think that was the point though. It was soul cleansing, reminding me shy I am here and how to be. Reminding the subconscious part of myself how to live a good life.


As soon as I felt it winding down though, I was like "divine mother I have one last thing to ask, something very important to me". At this point the Spotify AP I had running on a continuous loop stops playing, exactly as I ask this ![:-)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) As if to say, "hey I am paying full attention to you, so return the favor"

DPT with MXE or ketamine together is a truly awe inspiring trip to say the least. At high doses its righteously powerful and truly something everyone comfortable with combining and a bit of both should try. Just go read the trip reports and if your not drooling to try it...well than you may well be a more damaged psychonaut than most mentally. The imagery, the body high, the general highly euphoric feeling, truly second to none. So glad to see finally, after years of spouting off about this wonder, a pretty much full page of people testifying to its awesomeness. When I'm ever graced enough to get a decent supply of ket I always go hard, though I truthfully haven't had any since I started IM'ing as my more prominent ROA, so in a "sense"....it may be a bit easier to sustain...just a bit!![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) So I won't supply doses for that one but as little as ten mgs MXE with twenty five DPT should be somewhat noticeable. Double that and for a novice user who isn't that hard headed you'll be headed for what I'd guess would be fairly medium terrortory. Double the MXE again and add ten to twenty mgs of DPT to that and you'll be in solid to strong waters. Add twenty more mgs of MXE with ten or twenty mgs of DPT and you'll definitely be feeling it strongly if not very strongly(pretty hard to estimate nasal DPT for me as for whatever reason it always didn't really do much for me even up to 120mgs whereas IM at sixty is pretty strong. My personal favorite dose is 120mgs MXE with around 80mgs DPT. 


Personally I like the ketamine experience with DPT added and only ever got to try it twice. One thing that was easily clear to me, was that with ketamine, since in a sense for me anyways you need to let go if the added anesthesic effect is what elicits this isn't clear to me but with this addition it just seemed easier truly nosedive into the depths best. Don't get me wrong, it's not a huge difference or anything. I could easily run the streets like an MXEfied zombie probably higher than 150mgs IM but ketamine...? Hell no! As a note I've IM'd 150mgs of DPT at once on a solid dose of MXE with no troubles except a very powerful but fun trip.and never experienced any negativity during MXE/DPT excursions. I could be a bit of a hard head towards DPT though. It'd be weird since related compounds are just as potent and I follow the DPT IM guidelines for dosing(I just like to go high, especially with simple tryps). I've also never experienced any leg tremors on DPT either thank fuck! I don't get side effects as bad as some others tend to though for sure.... Oh and DiPT and MXE is fucking sweet as well, also surely worth traversing!


Sometimes I wonder what PCP and DPT would be like....!![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Do you remember what some doses for the ketamine + DPT combos that you found to go really well Help?


I've only done this combo once, and really liked it. It was very little K, about 10mg, with 60mg DPT. I would like to try 20mg ketamine with 80mg DPT, but really interested in dosages that other people have tried for this combo.

I am wanting to aquire some ketamine soon. After reading a specific trip report on erowid years back, ketamine just seemed like something I would like to experiment much with. I think it would be better in some ways than mxe for combineing with psychs. I have only had 500mg ketamine so far, but it seems more straight up anasthetic (i sniffed the last 200-250mg or so on 6 dif. drug binge night and came too 2 hours later with one leg still laying off the not having moved a muscle or being able to recall shit), with less crazy manic thoughts. Like it would be easier to take, lay back, and just experience what there is to see without paranoid semi psychotic shit potentially happening.


I have never used needles, but IMing ketamine is very very tempting. I am just kinda scared popping that cherry would end up with very bad things happening one day. I'm not a big fan of sniffing stuff, especially if trying to meditate while tripping. Not being able to breathe does not work well with that.


I read a post somewhere by a poster named Nuke about making ketamine equipotent plugged to nasal (instead of equipotent to oral, which is a huge waste). I may have to dig that one up and give it a go.


I dunno, everytime I take DPT it is kinda scary. Like DPT is a bipolar crazy and you never know if you will get the beauty or the horror, or a lil bit of both. More than some chemicals, it seems to be an entity/spirit of its own. A spirit that I ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

I went through 1000mgs of dpt in 2010.  I experienced the glory and the fear.  I got to combine it with ketamine on several occasions.


Dpt remains as one of the most worthwhile and challenging materials I have ever tried.  i would love to try it again someday.  


My experiences on it range from orgasmic bliss to alienating terror and body load, but regardless I was always curious to go back for more.

Hmm, weird as I can never think of DMT as anything but female. With DMT, I always see this goddess-jester entity: usually laughing her ass off at my expense. Still haven't gone far enough with DPT to see who's behind the curtain. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

yeah, perhaps its just semantics, but DPT does seem more masculine to me than DMT does.


perhaps the differing opinions of the substances' subjective genders is explainable through the concept of [Anima and Animus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_and_animus).

Interesting, so Sophia would be like a ++++? 


> The fourth and final phase of anima development is *[Sophia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(wisdom)), named after the Greek word for [wisdom](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom). Complete integration has now occurred, which allows women to be seen and related to as particular individuals who possess both positive and negative qualities. The most important aspect of this final level is that, as the personification "Wisdom" suggests, the anima is now developed enough that no single object can fully and permanently contain the images to which it is related.*

Sounds like it, doesn't it? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) (Not dissing Jung, love the guy)


I'm intrigued by this thread and DPT and haven't tried it or his female counterpart yet but want to give them both a try. DMT is shorter in duration right? DPT less intense? Which one would you recommend first?

they're pretty different substances.  DPT isnt really similar to DMT at all from my experiences.

Never felt scary to me either.  May just be me, but i find DPT somehow soothing and almost sedating in a way that DMT isn't.

Very different experiences, for me.

I'm planning my next DPT trip soon but I don't know what music I want to play during it. Basically music is my lifeline during the experience it is more powerful than anything else, it creates the experience and the space and the air and waves. Last time I listened to Erothyme's Circadia alb and it was ineffibly fantastic, an offering of the gods.

Have the ability to buy some DPT. Want to use it via IM. The vendor have it as : HLC Dark brown powder (97% purity). Is this purity really low for safely using it? How it can affect the trip?

Well, you really shouldn't trust vendors claims of purity. For what it's worth H users routinely inject things that are 30% pure on the luckiest (and possible last) day of their lives. 

If your going to IM read up on how to do it properly and get good filters. Start low.

Yeah but heroin users mostly IV, they dont IM. With intramuscular injections there is a lot less tolerance for crap in your drugs, because in the flowing blood there is much quicker neutralization (well it does depend what the crap is)... in the muscle, some things can sit there and fester. Mostly biologically contaminated drugs are a problem leading to abscess, or insolubles are a problem because they are sitting in your muscular tissue, for example damaging it or causing nasty bodily reactions in there.

Although of course if you IV bad enough stuff it will really ruin your veins, and if you do inject bacteria etc you can develop things like endocarditis or other inflammations in the cardiovascular system and then you are more royally screwed than with an IM abscess.


Fine enough wheel filters can handle both insolubles and bacteria / fungi. I strictly IM with wheel filtered drugs. For IM that should solve a lot of potential problems but is not a *guarantee* I guess.


DPT is discolored rather often, and even small quantities of impurities can account for the color... so not that great of an indicator either way. It's rather unlikely that the impurities are psychoactive, especially at higher potency than DPT, for them to matter in that way. So that is probably the good news.


That said, I am not really sure if I would take my chances injecting questionable compounds IM (never IVed anything) - I have injected a few compounds IM including tryptamines... and with dissociative addiction I even did sketchy things in terms of safety, but all of that really freaks me out because like I said, with IM you cannot really afford much.

I tried this compound yesterday at 36mg insufflated which is supposed to feel like a very low dose. 

Didn't read any of the thread as I wanted a free of suggestion experience.


First of all I noticed how much it hurt, nose was bearable but the throat was painful as nothing I ever sniff. Didn't get rid of this untill the end of the experience.

In a few minutes started to feel the effects. Cannot say they were really strong but they were definetely not weak. And if I had to describe them what it came to mind it was: This is a really strange animal.


To my despair of having this strangely unconfortable effect plus no visuals whatsoever( I don't get visuals with nothing lately which is annoying). I had really weird thoughts, thoughts that I didn't want to have, I don't even remember what they were, something kind of superficial, though I remember well my dissapointment at having them.

And ya, don't forget the tremor of the upper legs. Some kind of energy out of control that cause some kind of excitement and even erections, and strong unconfortability.


Not long after, the effects dissapeared suddenly and my clock said it was 2 hours after the start. It seemed much shorter than that which is surprising as I didn't have a good time at all, and psyquedelics usually stretch time to me.

The afterglow was quality as a hunter might feel after going to a hard hunt in a storm.


Conclusion: Didn't learn anything at least at a conscious level. The only thing I might have learnt is that an scrath from a tiger, however small, it is still an scrath from a tiger.

Next times I might try different ROA to see if I can get less bodyload. Maybe smoking with its shorter duration might be best way to introduce myself to it. Though smoking DMT is not my cup of tea. And I'm gonna start reading the thread to get contaminated with suggestions which hopefully will improve my next experiences.

i'd say you either need more or less than that dose for a good time.... sounds like you were stuck in that uncomfortable inbetween state where you're definitely pretty altered, but not far enough to get immersed in the experience.

Didn't think of that but kind of makes sense. I'll give it a thought but I think I want to change ROA too. Insufflation sounded so convenient as I don't like immediate effects, but it is too long when you get where you don't want to be and too painful to ignore. I believe I should go up but I cannot take much more bodyload.


Curious thing is after the storm was gone I was thinking about redosing, and only stopped me the difficult logistics, it being already back in the freezer, and thoughts about tolerance.


I've been reading a bit of the thread now and some mix with a bit of dissociatives. Never mixed psyquedelics with dissociatives as I'm not much of a dissociative user but probably it helps with the tremors.

I think pharmakos is right about the in between dose - for me it's been a really good as a drug for turning up in the 8-15mg range, and then it gets really bizarre and interesting at 50-60mg, but 25-30mg was kind of too functional to be immersive, yet too fucked up to be able to do anything. 


Probably good you didn't bother re-dosing might not have done much. 


I'm not into dissociatives at all, but DPT jives really well with ketamine, probably other dissociatives as well. I've had good results with a very tiny bump of K mixed in with 50-60mg DPT, sniff sniff. I bet MXE would go well too but I've never tried .


Some drugs really go hand in hand, and I think this is one of those cases.

I enjoy microdosed (10mg give or take) as much as higher doses. 40mg is a sweet spot for me, just enough to pierce the spacetime fabric but not too uncomfortable, but I assisted with a dissociative each time at that dose. Microdose is a nice body high and some thought alteration but not visual, combines well with other drugs and isn't immobilizing (but still will not want to move at the peak period which is less than an hour)

re: DPT + dissociatives...  DPT is the only psychedelic i like mixing with dissociatives.  let the dissociative kick in first, then once you get towards the peak snort the DPT.  leads to incredibly immersive experiences.

i've combined it with DXM, MXE, and 3-MeO-PCP.  all worked pretty wonderfully, tho i think i actually liked it best with DXM (assuming you can handle the double body load)


if bodyload is an issue for you, then i feel MXE would be the best companion with DPT.


3-MeO-PCP was a bit more hit-or-miss as a partner to DPT... the experience was a little too weird typically, even considering the fact that DPT and 3-MeO-PCP can be pretty weird on their own.

The one time I've done DPT so far, I did a bump of MXE right before to calm my pre-flight jitters.

It's interesting to see how many people agree that dissociatives + DPT go well. 

Vortech, your current avatar reminds me of the feeling of DPT.

I'm soon going to finally acquire this compound and I'm... what you could describe as "excitedly apprehensive" about taking it. I've been waiting for a long time, but I'm also nervous about the intensity of the experience & its side effect profile. 


Does anyone here have any positive experience plugging this chem? I'd like to avoid insufflation if I can, given what I've heard about the drip, but I don't want to prepare a freebase or inject. I will insufflate if plugging is not viable though. I am only getting 500mg so if the required dose is stupidly high I won't be wasting my time w/ this ROI.

DPT is wonderful.


I did 150mg insuflated with 6-10mg bumbed 3-meo-PCP. After 30-40 minutes. A cool and nice tryptamine feeling rushed up my spine, my whole room and all my plants started to breath and it was so sacred.


One time I got to a point where it was a little bit scary, nearly the feeling of "can this please stop now?" but my roomie was pleasent and talked with me, smoked some weed and listened to some calm music. Classic and some psyambient. Orange, green, red and blue symmetric and geometric visuals jumped around me and did whatever i thought about. 

The peak effect of it all lasted about 1 and a half hour. 


The day after was good, no headache or a kind of hangover. I took the bus and visited my granddad - took a walk and made some nice food together.


Very pleasent psychedelic journey in a very long time for me.

150mg was too much, especially since you had a dissociative launch pad.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  you passed a point, and reached the area where you're tripping so hard that you actually get overly focused on reality.  the sweet spot is a bit lower than that, the place where you're not so anxious, the place where you can let yourself go into fantasy land.  around half that dose done along with a dissociative is about perfect.  you would have been able to enter the dreamtime.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Yes i also think now that 150mg was a little bit too much, as you mentioned. I dont wanna reach the anxious point. I wasnt really anxious, only a bit because im epileptic and dont wanna black out and have a hard seizure. I got nervous when i thought about that, when it really started to peak. Luckily i had my roomie with me to talk to, and the anxious drifted slowly and nice away. I did alot of drawing, and played some backgammon with my roomie.

I had a very powerful experience on DPT a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I've used it plenty of times, but mostly at low doses. I had one intense trip a year ago that showed me its ego dissolving power. After my most recent experience I'm even more in love with it.


I wasn't planning on tripping, but I had been thinking about DPT recently. A few days previously, I was looking at H.R. Giger artwork and it reminded me very much of DPT. Its dark and a bit frightening, but also beautiful in a strange way, a blend of macabre and sexual themes. I decided to convert some DPT to freebase and put it in my freebase pipe so it would be ready to smoke later.


On the day of the trip I spent the whole day at home and I was feeling bored and apathetic. Suddenly I had the urge to have a beer or two to relax and take some DPT. I'll try not to go into graphic detail, but the sexual aspect of DPT is often a major part of the experience for me. I wouldn't use other psychedelics in this way but DPT is different. It seems like a paradox. It's powerful and produces religious feelings, but it's so kinky and hedonistic at the same time.


I'm pretty cautious with drugs and usually pretty conservative with my dosages compared to most people I see on these forums. The idea of snorting a fat line of a reality shattering psychedelic scares me. When I take DPT, I start off smoking it since it's not a big commitment. I'll smoke a little bit at a time, then if I like where the trip is headed, I'll start snorting small bumps of it. I usually don't get much of a drip, and I think it's because I snort about 10mg at a time then wait a few minutes.


After I smoked an unknown amount, I weighed out 55mg and snorted it over the course of an hour. By the time I finished it, the trip was getting intense. I smoked a little more and laid down. I could feel my body fading in and out of existence and my senses were starting merge together. The music I was listening to sounded amazing. I heard so much that I had never noticed before.


I had porn playing throughout most of the trip. I wasn't focused on it the whole time, but it really set the mood. Most psychedelics can be very erotic, but not really in the same way as DPT. LSD for example makes me feel like an animal and amplifies sensorial stimulation. DPT on the other hand is sexual in a more abstract, spiritual way. It's puts more focus on the power and submission aspects of sex. If you have any interest in kinky shit, DPT will surely bring it out. I spent much of the trip slipping in and out of a state of ego death, writhing in ecstasy, feeling like I was having sex with the universe. I turned off my air condition because it felt so good to be hot and sweaty. I remember at one point when I wasn't fully disintegrated I thought I was an oozing, slithering mass of wormlike creatures. I know that might sound like a weird thing to experience, but it was remarkably pleasurable.


The body load is an important component of a DPT trip for me. Some people say it's uncomfortable, but I think it feels amazing. I would go as far as to say that DPT is one of the least uncomfortable psychedelics I've tried. Its a lot different from other body loads. It isn't just a side effect, it's inseparable from the mind trip.  I love the way it completely overpowers you and all you can do is let yourself lose control. I can see how somebody who is afraid of completely letting go and losing themself in the trip could find it uncomfortable.


In the past, I haven't considered DPT to be very visual. During this trip, however, I saw the most amazing open eye visuals I've ever seen. It was like a moving, colorful Giger painting. At times. there seemed to be a bright glowing haze throughout my apartment, similar to a stereotypical depiction af heaven. The closest thing I can compare the trip to visually is ayahuasca. There is another thing that was happening that's difficult to describe. It was like I could see some of my thoughts. Like I would think something and see it as mental imagery, but there was no real line separating mental imagery from what I was actually seeing. I guess it's a form of synesthesia.


The effects came in waves. During the most intense points, I would lose all awareness of reality and all of existence would seem to collapse into a singularity, just a vibration that I could hear and feel with the entirety of my being. This happened many times, but I don't think it ever lasted very long. During the lulls in intensity there was still a lot of weirdness. At one point in the trip, reality would seem to change in a profound way that I can't even describe. It was like I kept traveling between alternate versions of reality. It was pretty disorienting when I tried to walk around. It was like my apartment would rearrange itself every few seconds. I can recall a brief moment when I was outside my body standing next to myself and I thought, "Okay, who all is here? It's me and this other guy, who is he again? Oh wait, thats just me". It's hard to remember some parts of the trip because what I was experiencing was so different from ordinary perception.


As much as I value my DPT trips, I wouldn't describe all of it as fun. When things get intense, it isn't "good" or "bad", it's everything, it's pure existence. To be honest, I can't disagree with people who say that DPT is frightening. It's scary in an exhilarating way. You just have to have faith in the fact that you'll be okay, let yourself go, and let the drug do what it does. It's pretty much what I imagine it would be like to go skydiving.


Compared to other psychedelics, the fear aspect of DPT seems without consequence. In my experience, it's more akin to the fear of imminent physical danger than to the deep existential despair and self doubt caused by something like LSD or mushrooms. I think DPT may be more likely to cause an unpleasant experience, but less prone to causing lasting psychological trauma. I can't speak for everybody of course. I guess how you react to it depends on what you are afraid of.


Immediately after the trip, I felt like I wouldn't want to have an experience like that for a very long time, but there's something very seductive about it that makes me want more. I'll probably give 4-HO-DPT another shot before I take DPT again. I haven't been impressed by it so far, but I feel like I should give it a chance. It does seem like it can be DPT-like at high doses, although the body load is pretty rough compared to DPT in my experience.

Curious you mention the kinky and sexual stuff. I had those kinds of thoughts and visions during my only DPT experience and I normally don't do, not to that point. It was quite upsetting to have them in the middle of a trip to be honest. It is kind of nice to hear it is a normal reaction.


All in all very interesting report.

I think it's a pretty common thing to experience and it seems to be a unique characteristic of DPT. I've seen other people in this thread describe DPT as kinky. When I get horny on other psychedelics, I feel like I'm very in touch with my animal instinct to mate and I see perfection in the female body. It feels so right and wholesome. DPT isn't like that at all. It isn't a bad thing though. Sometimes it's good to get weird.

The Geiger link is interesting - I've noticed a Geiger-esque quality to DPT, and talked about it here. I'm wondering if I got that idea from you, if you got it from me, if we both got it from somewhere else, or better yet if it's none of the above because there's something intrinsically Geiger-esque about DPT.

Great report, and it really makes me feel a little less nervous about doing DPT myself.  I've got some waiting for me, I just have always been afraid to try it, probably mostly because I read like every report on it before I had tripped much and it sounded terrifying and was often reported as such.  But it also truly seems like a special substance from everything I've read.  Your description made me feel more excited and less nervous about it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


You should put this in the TR forum too, it's one of the more relatably descriptive ones I've read.

+1 at adding to TRs.


I really wouldn't be scared of it, Xorkoth. I didn't find the chemical / experience itself to be scary, the only "terror" instead coming from the infinitely intense disillusioning I experienced in regards to every aspect of my identity and how I perceive the world. 2C-E or the 4 subbed DMTs could be just as scary as DPT, albeit in a different way.

It's strange, I feel like the vast majority of early DPT reports on Erowid involve lots of fear and discomfort.  But more recently the impressions I have received are not so much along those lines.

I've always found it to sound disconcerting (the kind of taunting sinister aspect which is often reported), but always found it intriguing that the very same people seemed somewhat attracted to it and always went back for more.

It does have a sinister vibe, but not in a taunting way, just the opposite - a welcoming seductive way. Or like a way of being completely within the vibe of sinister-ness. Not that it makes me be, or want to be sinister, or feel sinister but just that you can see the sinister nature of things, accept it, and it's really cool/real/beautiful.

I think the nature of the DPT trip is inherently Giger-esque. I  hadn't really thought about it, then a few days ago I was looking at a  lot of his artwork and though "wow, has this guy taken DPT before?"

I've got some waiting for me, I just have always been  afraid to try it, probably mostly because I read like every report on it  before I had tripped much and it sounded terrifying and was often  reported as such.  But it also truly seems like a special substance from  everything I've read.  Your description made me feel more excited and  less nervous about it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I can relate to your hesitancy to try DPT. I was intrigued by it for  years, but some of the trip reports I read scared me away from it. The  only reason I ended up trying it is because a vendor sent me some by  mistake. I feel very lucky, because I don't know if I ever would have  tried it otherwise, and now it's one of my favorite psychedelics.


If  you don't feel ready to be completely obliterated, just smoke a small  dose of the freebase. The nice thing about it is that the duration is  just right so that you can smoke a little at a time until you reach the  level you want to be at, and if it becomes unpleasant it won't take too  long to wear off. I sometimes smoke a small amount just to get a mild  psychedelic buzz for a few hours, although I've since discovered that  MPT is preferable for that kind of thing.

Pretty neat, I had to look that art up and it is spot on for DPT.  Much different than say DMT or psilocybin visuals.  The black, white and gray feel, the way they bundle up and release almost taking you on a roller coaster ride with it.  


I need to revisit.  My last 35 mgs trip was intense.  I have to say whenever I make it through the peak of a DPT experience I release a lot of fear and basically feel reborn. I swear my face looks younger having gone through that.

Had this one in my tool kit for ages now but always go for something more familiar instead. The fear aspect and physically uncomfortable aspects puts me off.

I've found that the physical discomfort can be mitigated with a small amount of ketamine, which also happens to combine famously with DPT. I'm super not into dissos, but even I can see how ketamine goes hand in hand with DPT. 


I wrote up a report from my notes, it's a few years ago now:


[Holy Ghost in the Machine](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/824453-(DPT-60mg-insuffl-Ketamine-7-10mg-insuffl-)-Experienced-Holy-ghost-in-the-machine?p=14060013#post14060013)


I've done it a few times since then, but not at that dosage, just little sniffs here and there. I'd like to go back, but it might be a while as I have a bit of a backlog of various substances that I also want to explore.

Very interesting to hear so much good things about that combo. Im a huge K fan but only indulge a few times per year because every time without fail it ends up me going on a binge going through about 7g personally in a few days.


Next time I have a good setting and some ket on hand I might try adding a small amount of DPT to see what all the fuzz is about.

The only time I've tried DPT I did a little bit of MXE first. It definitely helped me feel less of that blast off anxiety.

No. It is just absence of human perception. IMHO DPT is the DMT of our most close parallel universe (one previous/next universe in spacetime). DPT is alien to us, but still feels familiar, because of the similarities it shares with DMT, which is the spirit molecule of our universe.


Sounds pathetic and oafish I guess, but when I took DPT it is the best explanation I could come up with.

Hey guys! It's been a while since I have been on here. I have a question about DPT. I am def not new to psychedelics. But DPT is one I have avoided because I have heard it can get dark. 

My question is - has anyone ever had communication with the dead on this? Or is it just entity contact? Has anyone talked to a dead relative or whatever?

And if so was it positive communication?

I'm asking because my husband just died at a young age. And I really want to talk to him so badly

I've never communicated with the dead, or any kind of entity, on DPT. I can't say for sure whether it's possible to communicate with the dead, but if it is, I don't think it involves getting high on a drug.

If you have the capacity to do so in your being, you DNA, I don't see why DPT would specifically disallow it compared to other psychedelics. Do you have any other experiences in channeling or mediumship?

I'm very sorry about your loss...


I'd recommend vaporized DMT as it gives you more direct and emotionally emancipating experience than DPT.

A friend of mine had experience of seeing his dead relatives on DMT but he said it took him a while to understand the meaning of it and he doesn't really want to talk about the experience either.


DMT and LSD were particularly helpful for me dealing with accepting my father's death.


If you do decide to use DMT or DPT, I strongly recommend meditating attentively beforehand, direct your attention to what you are trying to reconciliate with and have proper set and setting for the experience.


Best wishes to you, **MocCozmiK**!

Thanks guys for replying. I agree that I'm probably not in the best mind state at this point for DPT. I could really imagine things going south or getting "dark".

I don't have any experience with mediumship. But I have also never had anyone in my life die so suddenly that I was close too.

My heart goes out to you MocCozmik... ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif) 


I think if ever there were a psychedelic that could be used to contact the dead, DPT might be it. I think in the old days shamans in mexico used mushrooms for this kind of thing. But I don't encourage you to use it for this at all, it seems too tricky and risky. I think it would be so hard to tell what's what, what's real, what's not. I mean for this kind of thing to work you have to let go a little bit of the hard concepts of reality, so there's the potential to get lost in it...

MocCozmik if I could impart one piece of wisdom onto thee it would be do not play with what you do not know. Go to someone else if you wish to have contact. You do not know what you are dealing with.


This is serious. Do not attempt contact with the dead for personal means without the proper procedure. Find another.

I agree. Thank you all for the good advise. Thanks perpetualdawn, I really connected to what you said. I have been scared to try DPT for a while for a good reason. 

Since all this happened I have laid off all psychedelics for a while. Just going to try to adjust to this new normal with my husband no longer here with me. I feel very lost. And I realize that right now, psychedelics are not the answer to what I am looking for. 

Thanks everyone ![❤️](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/2764.png)

pretty much this. I've had DPT probably 20+ times. It always has an edge (to me) like "hahaha will I fuck with you today or won't I... ooooo shit you're fucked" and I keep doing it. I love it for some reason.

I'm attracted to DPT (not that I've taken it very many times, just a handful) because the taunting sinister aspect is manifests in a compassionate way. I always find this hard to explain, but it's not like watching a horror movie at all. It's more like being illuminated to the fact that there's a dark side to things, and that's OK, it's the nature of things to have a dark side. We normally blind ourselves to a lot of reality because it makes us uncomfortable.

It's interesting to see a kind of shift in the perception of this chemical since I last was reading about it a couple years ago. I got the impression then that DPT was up there with DMT in spiritual nature and even remember a religious group that used it as their main communion. 


Intramuscular DPT has been on my list for a while now because of it's reputation as a sort of "God chemical", but with these new reports of a dark, sinister vibe I'm not as enthused to make the leap and finally cross it of the list.

It's more of an anti-god chemical in a way. It's as profound as DMT but in an entirely different way. It's just not love and light and rainbow elves in dimensions that you've always been from and entity contact abound.


If you go back to late October, early November in my posts or the social talk thread, maybe actually somewhere in here too, you can read my posts after I had my complete and total disillusionment experience with DPT. It was quite possibly the most impactful psychedelic trip of my life, or at least had the deepest and farthest reaching implications.

Dark and sinister gives the wrong impression. I've never felt any kind of maliciousness from it at all. It's one of the best music enhancers I've sampled for sure. That's not sinister right?


I don't know about it being a sort of "God chemical", but it's true that there is/was some fringe cult that uses DPT as it's sacrament. I think they established a legal right to be able to use it for this purpose. I can't compare it to DMT regarding it's spiritual nature, but personally in my explorations, nothing comes close to 5-MeO-DMT for delivering the quintessential mystical experience.


IM would be the ideal ROA with this IMO, if you had sterile and pure material.

DPT was like an electric shock of energy and reality morphing and "oh shit what the fuck" and then I felt a dark energy almost watching me or maybe it was part of my ego split up. It was amazing but also dark compared to a large dose of good old LSD. Never tried DMT so my gold standard of comparison is LSD which I would choose over this for all types of experiences.

It's interesting reading others peoples perceptions of DPT. I particularly like the comparison between DMT and DPT and different universes. There is something particularly alien about DPT. I don't perceive is as dark or evil but I can see how some might. I perceive it as the trickster — an alien intelligence that plays games of logic. At least that's what I saw. Often with DPT I seem to get a choice between darkness and light. I always choose the light. That choice seems to abort my trips somehow. So yeah, maybe there is something a little sinister about it but I feel loved and protected nonetheless while on it like it doesn't mean me harm. Hard to say for sure though. The force behind DPT is smarter than I am. Here's what I wrote about my 90 mg DPT + 10 mg 3-MeO-PCP trip a while back


> Yesterday I had my first full blown trip in a while. I revisited my old friend DPT. 90mg about 5 hours after a 10 mg dose of 3-MeO-PCP. Glorious! Some of the archetypal aspects of the experience came alive full force. These were difficult to see. The trickster knows every game in the book and its him I saw looking back in the mirror. I've never been able to see it so clearly without going into panic: it isn't me and nothing can change that, but I saw how it operates very clearly, like some magician doing games of logic so you see only riddles. You can't beat it at its own game.

> Trust became the main theme of the trip. Nothing can be held apart from presence. The densified strata opened up outside of me. I could feel the layers and the constituent interactions that hold them together. They opened and then later closed again. Perhaps it was an opportunity to move on? I had doubts and the window closed gently. Whatever, not meant to be a TR but damn. I was naked in my back yard rejoicing at the beauty that is offered us every moment in every pore in the sky, blossoming like a flower till you can't stand it. What a fool I am when I choose to be apart from it because I think I know better. What love to know there is no way to break that connection. No real choice but to forgive and trust.

DPT really seems to be one of the strange ones, I am really intrigued by it. Maybe I am mistaken, but it seems to me a lot of people are taking DPT in combination with a dissociative, like more often then is the case with other psychedelics. For those of you that do, why is that? Is it just a general interest in combinations and trying to kick it up a notch? Or is it the opposite and more like trying to take the edge off a little bit in some sense? Because I remember specifically ketamine being recommended to calm 'pre flight jitters' and also help with bodyload/tremors and stuff. Or would that only go for ketamine but not for something like 3-MeO-PCP, like mentioned above? I know next to nothing about dissociatives, please enlighten me.

It's really hard to say how dissociatives change DPT trips except perhaps to help a bit with the fear. That strategy may backfire however by increasing the intensity or weirdness of the trip so that the net effect may be more fear then without a dissociative. DPT trips have a big surprise factor generally. They're not particularly predictable in my experience unless you start using DPT every day, then it sort of evens out an becomes a more generic psychedelic. The last couple years I've used DPT about 3 times all with some 3-MeO-PCP in my system. 6-7 years ago when I was tripping on DPT a lot I used it mostly alone or occasionally with MXE. I have no idea what the trend is. 


As for the trickster thing, I did a search and found others describing something similar which is really interesting. They were using DMT however so guess it isn't exclusive to DPT.

Yeah I see, cannabis has a similar ambivalence for me in that it can kind of mellow out a trip while making it more intense at the same time.

DPT+a dissociative is absolutely awesome. It leads to a truly deep trip that always takes me to the most strangely beautiful places! It's one of my favorite combos. I've tried many many psychedelics combos as well.

I'm really interested in DPT and have much respect for it, but just haven't had much luck with it yet.


I made a couple attempts to convert the HCl to freebase (with no prior experience in conversion) and also tried insufflation. I'm not interested in using needles.


When I vaporized the freebase it should have been about 35mg each time, but I only got subtle psychedelic effects from it. I'll assume this dose was too low.


When I snorted it, I did one with 50mg about an hour after I first tried vaporizing the freebase. I gave that about an hour until I determined it wouldn't get any stronger, but still had fairly subtle effects. I didn't get any visuals but my vision became sharper and senses heightened a bit. No changes in energy but had a creepy feeling that some presence showed up to say, "Hi", though it was hard to discern.


It gave me congestion in my nasal cavity, along with a bit of numbness that I would compare to snorting cocaine. The numbness lasted a few hours and the congestion about 24 hours.


A couple weeks later I snorted 100mg during the comedown of an ALD-52 trip. I did notice some psychedelic effects that were different from what I was feeling from the lysergamide, but for the most part it just gave me congestion and a headache that lasted for 24 hours.


I'm not sure if the doses were too low for me, or if I really need a long tolerance break before trying this one again, as I don't seem to be very sensitive to it. Either way, I probably won't snort it again.


I'm also interested in trying the oral route, both with and without harmala alkaloids. I've never taken an MAOI so will need to do more research on those and try them independently before mixing with anything in the future, if I decide to ever ingest them.


Has anyone ever combined oral DPT with 5-MeO-MiPT (Moxy)? I've read that Moxy may have MAOI properties to it, so wondering if that would potentiate the DPT?


I may also try the 4-AcO/HO- versions of this, though I would expect those to be different in terms of effects.

Wow it surprises me how weak the effects sound for the dosages you took. Maybe it's super degraded or bad purity? Hows your snorting technique? If a lot of it ended up down your throat and into your digestive system, that would really nullify it. 100mg is a lot to get up your nose.. 


Other psychedelics work normally on you?

It occurred to me it may have been a bad batch, or an older batch, though I've never had any issues with other chemicals. I didn't store it for too long before I tried it out, only about a month. I kept it in the original packaging (clear plastic bag inside black mylar bag) inside a fireproof/waterproof safe with an Eva-Dry down in a cool basement.


It was a really fluffy white powder, and looked to be in decent shape.


I did a soft snort on it just to get it in there and experienced no drip. It just hung out in the upper region of my nasal passage and numbed the back of the roof of my mouth. I was also careful when the sniffles started to not breathe in too hard because I didn't want to suck it into my throat.


The only other psychedelic I haven't really gotten strong effects from yet is Metocin. But otherwise everything else has worked normally at the common doses.

I wouldn't suspect storage to be an issue; I've had it stored poorly for extended periods without any notiacable degradation.

Also wouldn't want to jump to conclusions about a bad batch, but who knows...

The highest I ever went was 60mg with a supposedly impure (cinnamon-brown) batch from ages ago. It melted my world for sure.


edit: just remembered that the two times I've taken it up past 20mg, I combo'd it with a very tiny amount of ketamine. A lot of people have good results combining this with dissos, maybe that's the ticket? It was like 10mg or maybe even less.

I took a 70mg intranasal dose of DPT a few days ago and I'm experiencing a truly ecstatic afterglow. Everything  feels so different now. When I listen to music or look at psychedelic  artwork, I get a strong feeling of something beyond our world,  something vast and powerful and important. I feel sober, but at the same  time capable of feeling a sense of awe as if I'm at the peak of an acid  trip. I'm an atheist, but DPT is a deeply spiritual chemical, there's  not a better way I can describe it. It's something truly unique and  beautiful. I haven't felt this way in a long time. It's like I tripped  for the first time again.


I get why many people dislike DPT, but those people just don't understand it. Yes, the DPT experience can be dark and terrifying and grim and dirty feeling, but that's part of reality. It's inescapable. Only by allowing yourself to accept those things can you transcend them, and then be able to truly accept the magnificent beauty that is ever-present, always surprisingly close by.


This was my third time taking DPT at this kind of dose. The difference is that I had drank alcohol the first two times but was sober this time. Alcohol seems to dull the effects. It was just as "intense" the first two times, maybe even more so in a way, but the experience was far more complex this time. I was finally able to experience the vivid and detailed hallucinations I have read about in trip reports.

That sounds amazing, thanks so much for sharing it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I have to say, in the short time I've now been working more with base tryptamines, one of my favorite effects of theirs by far even more so than anything directly psychedelic is this incredible antidepressant effect that begins in the afterglow and then just extends on and on, and in retrospect I definitely noticed this after other things like my oral MiPT experience too. Just a deeply refreshing, energizing positivity about life that I had been starting to really miss. I still haven't tried DPT yet to compare, but I can only imagine that it'll be similar, if not even deeper based on the reports.... I really feel so lucky to have these molecules in my life right now, they certainly feel like the most healing new (for me) psychoactives I have come across in quite some time. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


You're definitely making me incredibly excited to try it with your description of it.... This should be the next tryptamine I use for sure, though I may try something like 2C-C as a mellower in-between to help myself really refresh for it, I definitely want to get the full experience as well....

Lol, I was just looking through the B&D thread V1, and you've been saying that for 10 years. I'm not making fun of you, I totally understand your hesitation. It's funny the way thinking about a trip too much can psych you out. I've tripped over a hundred times but I still often get really nervous before a trip. My first breakthrough DPT trip was totally unplanned. I was just drunk and started snorting small bumps of DPT, not really thinking about what would happen. Then everything got really weird and I was like "oh shit, what have I done."


A lot of people consider DPT to be sinister, but it really isn't, it can just be blunt and unforgiving at times. I think someone as experienced and you should be able to handle it just fine. I think part of the reason it has a reputation for being scary is the result of people not respecting how powerful it is and taking too much. Look at the bad trip reports on Erowid and the kinds of doses those people took. Many of them are first time experiences with doses like 100, 150, even 200 mg or more, or not measured at all.

That sounds like a good time, MPT is very laid back. I could see somebody using it regularly the way people smoke weed. You can smoke a little and just chill out for a few hours.

I think around 20mg would be good. A little more or a little less wouldn't hurt. The nice thing about smoking psychedelics is you can do a little bit at a time until you get where you want to be.

Basically this. I plugged something like 120mg DPT and  probably 250-400mg MDMA w/ an assload (haha) of MXE one night. Like the most crazy fucked up shit was comming into my mind. I felt like I was floating through realms of suicided people who were lost. Saw visions of my loved ones dying. I just sat there with a straight facing chanting "aummmmm" like "well fuck it. this is life. I'm not scared. If it's what happens it's what happens. Can't run from it.


Would really like to do that again.

Sorry for slightly off topic, but it may be useful to have this info in this thread anyway. 


Do you notice significant potentiation/synergy between MXE and tryptamines? Or is it just, as you say, a "soft launchpad" to hijack come-up anxiety or whatever. I tried it once with 4-AcO-MET and MXE but I'm not entirely sure if there was synergy or not. I was specifically thinking about mixing 4-AcO-DMT with some MXE today but I'm unsure about dosing.

Well to be fair, with ibogaine, for me, there was no room for fear, I was dreaming basically the whole time, I wasn't even aware I was doing ibogaine or that I was Xorkoth.  But yeah I know I'll love DPT.  Just gonna wait for a time when I feel like a deep solo trip.  I'm so busy these days it's hard to find the time.

Yeah I notice a big synergy.  It provides a nice launching pad but it also seems to bring out all the deep, powerful aspects of the tryptamines very strongly, for me.  Probably my favorite drug combo, MXE and tryptamines.


I'm not sure I want to just bag wash the MXE, I have basically no disso tolerance and I have no idea how much could be in there.  With no tolerance, if I get like 75mg or more of MXE at once it spins me the fuck out to the point that it's really unpleasant.  I'm just gonna scrape when the time comes and see how much I get.  Even 25mg would be great to combine.

I have been to afraid to try DPT because of all the “dark and sinister” comments and post I have read. DMT was amazing for me! It was a crazy, awesome, experience. I was in another dimension somewhere and it was happy. 


Now I have had some pretty scary experiences on IV 4-Ac0-dmt. Which IV 4-aCO-dmt is so eerily similar to DMT. But it last for over an hour and half- 2 hours. But I have also gave amazing experiences on it. 


Maybe DPT gets a bad rap. I have read more scary experiences than positive. And our brain chemistry is all so different, I fear I am the one who will have a horrific terrifying experience

If you go into the experience expecting it to be bad it's more likely to go bad. That's fine though, you don't have to try everything.

I haven't tried DPT myself, but if you are aware of the importance of set and setting and start with a small dose I would think a "horrific terrifying experience" is pretty unlikely to happen. IIRC a lot of the reports that painted DPT in such a negative light were made by people who did rather high, sometimes eyeballed, doses.

Yeah I haven't tried DPT yet for the same reason.  Seems silly to me though, these days almost all the stuff I hear people saying are that it's wonderful, that it can be challenging but not sinister or terrifying, and very rewarding.  Most of the old reports are of people snorting like 100mg, which is too much.  I plan to try it soon, maybe 50mg.

DPT definitely doesn't have sinister and terrifying qualities. Where the terror comes in is with the extreme disillusionment that can happen, and the horror that can accompany facing and experiencing the truth.

You'll be fine, now that my life has stabilized I wish to try it again and I'd have no problem taking 100mg or more even snorted.  The only reason it rocked me was the fact that I was a shitty person at that time and did it on a whim.  After the initial fear/evil phase it was a wonderful experience and changed me for the better for sure.  Ironically, the drug I feared most other than DPT (which was DMT) actually cured me of my fear of this substance.  I think nothing of smoking DMT weekly now and I'd think nothing of taking DPT in a high dose again.  Although I would set aside two days for it and show it the utmost respect and I wouldn't take it in a social setting of more than 2-3 people.


Edit: also if I were to combine with MXE I'd do the MXE after, perhaps at hour 3-4.  I did a DPT+MXE combo plugged shortly after my breakthrough with DPT and didn't find much value in it.  DPT overpowered the MXE.  I'm sure in the right dose it'd be fun but you should become familiar with DPT alone first imho.

It's just that I've found MXE (dissos in general but especially MXE) to be wonderful launch pads for tryptamines.  Take like 20, 25mg of MXE, and then a dose of a tryptamine, and the tryptamine goes deeper, more comfortably.  I don't think to myself, wow, it feels like MXE and a tryptamine... it just feels like the tryptamine is primed and smoother.

I'm so terrified of DPT that the only way I can trick myself into taking it, is to use it during fiendish amphetamine sessions (which I don't do anymore). I had quit smoking weed which would normally be my goto substance if I wanted more, more, more so I turned to DPT and insufflated 30mg bumps until I was 'satisfied'.


It's a stupid way to use/ abuse this 'beautiful' drug, but I needed the recklessness of the amphetamine rush in order to even dare touch the stuff. That said, I absolutely love DPT, even for all the terror of seeing black magic rituals performed by evil alien sorcerers that I had to look away from because I was sure these rituals would affect real life, touching strange tentacle flailing tree strunk like objects that I was certain I could take back to the physical realm, and feeling the strange sound/ vibration/ energy that manifests on high doses.


Even more so than DMT, maybe because of the longer duration, DPT gave me the impression of shifting to other realms that are no less real than our own plane of existence, and even more so than on DMT, I have wondered if we are actually even allowed to see these things.


I noticed that the days after a DPT trip I'd feel absolutely marvellous, also I'd be very flirty. Also the trips themselves are definetely often verys sexual in nature.

I understand, I'm just saying with DPT you might rob yourself of some of the important aspects by attempting to smooth it out.  I'd save the MXE for the next time.  I'd also shoot for the full breakthrough instead of taking 50mg or so, although I can understand wanting to test the waters before going that far.  Given all your experience I think you'd be robbing yourself by not shooting for a breakthrough your first time with it.  Do what feels right, you know yourself better than anyone.

I have tried with and without the disso, and I didnt find any dampening of the clarity;  the DPT does overpower the disso as it should, but the disso smoothes the funky waves of the come-up and then disappears into a transparent window pane offering a layer of perspective and shielding without losing any light.

I agree about the idea of the disso as a 'launchpad'. Instead of the awkward shift to hyperdimensional consciousness like a 'breaking' through cracks, it feels much more like a frictionless 'slipping into' extra dimensions. For many tryptamines I find there are bunch of unnecessary autonomic physical responses on the come-up that seem to be bypassed through dissociation (almost like the body thinks it has been poisoned and gives that queezy ungrounded feeling).  Last night I dosed 4-aco-dmt while on the second half of an O-PCE dose, and wow, more in common with a 3 hour DMT trip than a mushroom trip. Within 15 minutes of dosing my phase synchronization started slipping hard with a couple minutes of funky wavering before I found my 'sea legs', and instead of the shift being uncomfortable as it would be without a disso, it was just funny. And then I went into a series of mini holes for a couple hours. Anyway, I got slightly off topic by now, but yes the trypta-disso combo has many synergies.

I went into DPT expecting white light and to be handed a Torah.  Instead it scared the living daylights outta me and inspired me to write Damn Powerful Tryptamine.  


Nevertheless subsequent exposures at lower levels and different methods of administration proved more favorable.  Finally, vaping the freebase a decade after my first try was very pleasurable.


If there is one conclusion to be made about dpt....is that it is strong stuff.  I'd recommend careful titration and not jumping  in at 100mg like I did.  I find 30mg vaped or IMed plenty adequate.

is dpt a useful psychedelic in terms of headspace? problem solving? therapy tool? shift in perspective?


from reading most of these reports, it sounds like more of a novelty psychedelic (albeit a very powerful novelty)...


id really like to try it one day, but atm, unless it has potential for being as useful or moreso than mushrooms or lsd, i dont think i necessarily NEED it. 


sounds hella crazy and fun, tho.


*edit*


what about the melded egos/ shared consciousness realm/ interconnectiveness of all things mind-state?

I wouldn't call it a novelty psychedelic. To me a novelty psychedelic would be something like DiPT or nitrous. DPT is a heavy-duty magical badass fairy dust reality/illusion dissolver. "Fun" wouldn't be my first descriptor. Depends what you call fun though. It's no carnival ride, it's a fucking trip for sure. 


I don't think you necessarily *need* it, but I'm very glad to have it on the roster. It's unique.

I didn't find it to be that sort of a vibe to it, but perhaps I've just never gone there with it. It somehow seems more concerned with the multiplicity of all things, the crazy complexities of reality and the stark truth of the matter.

thank you for that. 


so far, i really like 4-aco-dpt, and can see some similarity between my experiences with it, and ppls reports of dpt (particularly the alien intelligence creeping in). 


i still have some of that 21yo psychonaut self in me, itching to try new things for the experience, but lately i want things for truly helping myself and others grow towards greatness. sounds like dpt may have a little of both columns.

my partner had a rather intense (but not psychedelic) experience with dpt. 


she and i decided to go a bit under the low end of the "common" oral dosage as listed on erowid, so i measured about 275 mg, 

and began trying to dissolve it in distilled water.

 it took adding some lukewarm water, but probably 80% of it dissolved, 

before i added lemon juice, which seemed to take it pretty close to 99% dissolved. 

i decided this was close enough, added oranje juice, and did the ol' back and forth between cups thing, until i was satisfied with the percieved homogeny. 


t+0


i divided the juice evenly, and we imbibed. 


she was quite put off by the bitterness, but i couldnt taste it at all (maybe this shoulda tipped me off to something amiss, but i have a teflon tongue when it comes to bitter, so i thought nothing of it)


we go to the kitchen so she can have a bit off food. 


t+30min


she uttered a strong "uh-oh", and i knew it was time to move to the bedroom. i was feeling nothing, save for a slight probably placebo effect (it wouldnt truly reveal itself to me as a mere +1 until another half hour from then, but this is about her experience)


we make it upstairs, and apparently the body load is very uncomfortable for her. 


i decided to go quickly finish cleaning up the mess in the kitchen, and make it back into the room (not even 3 minutes prolly), and shes in the fetal position sobbing. 


---


t+45min


i stay with her and try to comfort her as best as i can, fearing for her mental well-being. it turned out to be mostly physical/ emotional rather than psychotomimetic like i was VERY afraid of, but i just had to reassure her that she wasnt gonna die, and when the drug was out of her system, she would be back to her chipper self. 


theres a lot of "this is too much" and "never again" and a WHOLE lotta "NONONONONO!"


she vomited up her dinner, and mostly lay on the floor. at one point, she exclaims something about how she doesnt want me to touch her (i later asked her to expound, apparently its like when someone surprises you on the back with ice, except it was a warmth and not a cold)


at one point, to paraphrase her: "why would people take this drug? feels terrible, and theres nothing enlightening happening in my head!" apparently her trip was nearly 100% nasty body load (no psychedelic "trip" whatsoever to speak of, except for a few visual phenomena)


eventually, she asked me about trazodone (she has some for veryoccasional help with insomnia/ depression). my first instinct is not to mix serotonin receptor ligands we know little about, but after some internet searches, and no benzos, we give it a shot (100mg @t+1hr15min, or thereabouts)


twenty more minutes of extreme awful bad bad crying, then she suddenly seemed placid. in another 20 minutes, she was laughing at fart jokes (still felt like shit, tho, apparently)


---


some notes:


"feeling of dread, never gonna end, like something bad was getting ready to happen"


she also says that the tears were not really hers; like the drug itself was activating her "now you must cry" receptors. there apparently was an intense fear response her body had to go through (mgs "damn powerful tryptamine", anyone?)


she likens the bodyload to the feeling on acid (mushrooms, etc...) where one gets the tingles/ nervous tension, and the feeling of needing to poop, pee, eat, vomit, scream, die, etc... im sure you know the feeling... that "everything in the world what are we gonna do omgz lol" feeling, but times a million, and all negative.


oh, and as for the visual phenomena, once she could lay on her side and really look at things, she said everything was in HD. and there was a random aleve pill on the floor, and she said that as she would try to focus on it, the pill would disappear and reappear over and over. 


she never did muster up the strength to make it up onto the bed, so we slept on the floor, and the next day everything was back to normal (back to her old chipper self lol, save for a fairly solid aversion to dipropyltryptamine), aside from some SERIOUS diarrhea that smelled like base tryptamines. 


---


so i can think of two reasons for this: 1) dpt is VERY unpredictable from person to person, or 2) the cold orange juice kicked the dpt out of solution, and she got a much bigger pie slice than i did (but why would an excess of acid in water kick a water soluble salt out of solution?)

after reading more reports, and reminiscing about past trips, and after what happened to my partner, im gonna hesitate on my research with this one. i am pretty afraid of the possibility of bringing back old schizoid behavior from difficult to integrate past experiences with dmt and mushrooms (also probably cannabis and salvia)


perhaps once im cozy. i already have a person that wants to take it for their own research, so that makes it easy.

In my experience smoking low doses (even worked with the hcl, but I would not repeat it, since I value my lung function nowadays) and titrating is much more gentle regarding the otherworldly body load than snorting 80-100mg or taking it orally with MAOI.

is smoking dpt freebase like smoking dmt freebase (in regards to tolerance)?


ie, will i be able to try again right away, or will i need to wait a week?

I could go back right away although I would usually wait about an hour in between sessions (or more).  Be careful with it and go slowly.  It isn't like DMT where it all has to be done in one shot/a few tokes.  Also, it smells awful so if you don't want it to linger in the house it might be best to do it outside.  I vaped some out of a home made bulb once and the wind blew just a tiny amount through the door.  It stunk up the house so badly that someone inquired about what the hell I'd been smoking a few hours later.


Oh speaking of this one I made a mistake about a week ago.  I gave away an old pipe I'd had for years to a close friend.  There was old weed packed in the bowl half-burnt.  I advised my friend it was probably best to dump it because it was really old.  Well, they smoked it instead.  It caused great distress in them for about an hour.  I later realized that it was a pipe I'd been smoking DPT base out of many years ago and that's why so much old weed was left in it.  Need to be more careful.  They were fine and I was honestly surprised that it was still even active after all these years.  Had I known what I had I'd have probably smoked it myself.

Subjectively for me it smeels nice, but it is a very harsh odor (smoked the unadulterated hcl) which remembers one of gasoline. It smells/tastes far better than the drip from snorting big amounts anyway. I smoked it in a bong but I was young and careless back then.

so id started a freebasing experiment a week or two ago, and decided to make an attempt


(in case anyone cares, ill share the method at the end of the post)


i gathered what i could (it took dragging lavender flowers through the oil until i was satisfied with the amount), probably 20-40mg (im not even gonna think about how futile weighing this stuff is)


setup: dim bathroom, this time with traditional zen music, this time with a green hue to the room, rather than red like my last experiment. (i think the same teal i get from 4-aco-dpt is definitely in favor with dpt, as well)


method: meth style oil burner (u know the type...) and a jet lighter, circled the lavender flowers a few times, then went for it. took a total of three decent hits, but the lavender flowers had begun combustion by the third. 


if smoking a cig of chamomile (trust me... incredibly harsh) is a 10, and smelling a rose is a zero, i would say smoking the hcl is an 8 and the vaping of the freebase is a 1. seriously, smooth and delicious. 95%thc wishes it were nearly this easy on the lungs/ throat...


the experience: i started to feel that familiar glide into tryptamine soup feeling, with the chill body amazingness ive come to know from my few, modest dpt trials. no visuals, and i lay back on the floor, chilling with the music. 


i see a face in a hanging towel that i begin conversing with in my head, which when i assess it, is actually a bit unnerving. 


i decided i actually wanted to jump into the shower at this point, and i think im peaking (i was...)


***


the body high is amazing (fwir, kinda like a subtle version of the space-electricity-emotional-orgasmism ive had from dmt, plus somewhere around the drunken/ goofy feeling of a mushroom comeup (eth-lad certainly shares a bit of this, and i think the dpt is more loosy-goosy, like eth-lad, rather than awkward, like mushrooms can be in my body)


i also feel an empathogenic feeling that makes me want to chew/ suck my mouth into oblivion, although not really a mood lift, and no stimulation (if 4-aco-dpt lost its peripheral stimulation, and had a slightly more euphoric high, these drugs might be indistinguishable at the +2 level, where i think this experience reached)


i almost felt as though i was slipping into a hypnagogic type state, only without feeling like i was gonna fall asleep, and hella euphoric. havent had such a good body high since a year or two ago when opioids started giving me sciatica


***


holy fuck i love to ramble. 


anyway, i finished off what i could get out of my evap vessel, and i was able to get two more peaks, and even feel like i hit a +3 in the last peak (i guess piggybacking after a peak is a thing, not just a redose but a rise in intensity)


the trip seems to go like this: mentally gentle comeup with a huge body high that borders on anxiety attack that subsides into an incredible euphoria with maybe a bit of that tryptamine magic-thought, and a tiny bit of visuals. cannabis (smoked after the third peak) really brings out the classic fractal geometry infinity patterns in the natural grains of everything, but still no color enhancement. i became focused, and although the dpt gave me some light comedy, the real profound absurd hilarity i get from tryptamines came out once i smoked the pot. 


if id taken acid, i would say i skated around at a high +2, but i have a feeling that this is just the beginner's course for dpt... 


?????????????′


**for those that want to know**


so my freebase technique is simple, gathered from internet reading:


dissolve dpt hcl in water, slowly pour in household ammonia until a precipitate forms (i guess this is what ppl call an "emulsion" since now the dpt freebase is suspended as tiny beads in the water, visible as the cloud that should have  just formed)


now the tricky part: if youre lucky to have 96% pure dpt, you might be able to get it to cake up on itself, a-la crack, but if you have some stuff that basically will not coalesce into one chunk of stuff, you need a non-polar solvent. 


i stupidly forgot about my dmt extracting days, and went for xylene (heavy and hard to evap) instead of vm&p naphtha (what you want, unless you can source lab grade (n)hexane or (n)pentane... vm&p naphtha is just a not-so-lab-grade mix of both, and i think their isomers)


take the dpt "emulsion" and in a good vessel for shaking (hopefully made of glass or polypropylene which is fairly chem resistant), add the non-polar solvent of choice, shake, and let the layers settle. 


if you have a separatory funnel (hopefully you know how to get a free amine if you use lab glassware) lucky you... 


for everyone else, there are two easy methods i can think of...


A) careful not to disturb the bottom layer, suck up the np solvent layer thats on top of the water (turkey baster if its a large amount, oral syringe or micropipette if small amount)... squirt into a proper evaporation vessel, and repeat a few more times. 


B) get a nice big freezer bag, hang it over a sink with a bottom corner facing straight down... let the layers separate, and poke said bottom corner to slowly drain the water layer. make sure to watch closely so u dont waste any dpt by letting the top layer drain... CATCH it and move your dpt solvent to another freezer bag (im sure these solvents are not great for plastic bags), repeat until your ocd is sated or you stop smelling cat-pee, move to evap vessel. 


evaporate the non-polar solvent, leaving beads of oil everywhere


*** theres more to it than "evap and smoke"


for those that want to be super clean, get you some 99% isopropyl (i think 91% will do) alcohol, and dissolve the dpt again (after the n.p.solvent is evaporated) in the rubbing alcohol. 


by evaporating, dissolving again in isopropyl and repeating, not only can you manipulate your dpt into one puddle, but according to greywolf at skunkpharmresearch (the man when it comes to cannabis resin purification), the non-polar solvent should be totes gone by the third alcohol evaporation.

I'm thinking of buying 250 mgs of DPT to try. A lot of people say that it produces scarier visions then DMT, but readin through here people seem to enjoy it. I really want to use it to breakthrough. I made a thread about 4 aco DMT and breakin through by using it IV. Can't seem to find any info on that either, just a couple of threads where the only person to try it was the OP....

i would recommend getting more than 250mg. ppls experiences are all over the place... in terms of dosage, favored roa, etc... i would recommend getting enough that you can titrate carefully and still have enough for future experiments.

Ok....so maybe 500 mgs to a gram? It's not that expensive, I don't mind scooping some up.


But 250 mgs seems a lot....I honestly don't think I'd waste good pure tryptamines by trying to vape them, I'd probably burn it. I think I'm gonna go IV when I do try. That way I should be guaranteed a good breakthrough, and as long as I don't IV something crazy like 200 mgs and start low I should be ok I

I actually ordered 250 mgs of this, for an insanely low price, ( the reason I got it).


I've been reading conflicting reports when it comes to dosages. I would be using the DPT via intramuscular injection. I really enjoy 4 aco DMT IM. 


I just hear a lot of people say dpt produces more frightening visions then DMT or 4 aco DMT. I personally would probably chalk it up to mind set....for me personally, all the lysergamides feel the same, and take me to the same place, the only thing being different for me is the dosage weight of the chemical. I feel the same way about tryptamines for the most part, or at least, IV 4 aco DMT felt just like smoked NN DMT to me


Edit: Does anyone know how this would store in water? Could I dissolve 250 mgs in water to so I can measure my doses without weighing individual doses?

IM seems like it would be a great ROA for this. I've never felt quite comfortable enough about the purity to do it, but I think it would totally be the way to go. 


If you store it in water it should be sterilized water. I don't know how it would store in water in terms of stability. It certainly would be less stable in water than stored dry. I'd probably just weigh out individual doses when I needed them and not store it in a water solution tbh.

Right on, thanks PD.  ya I was thinking it may break down faster in water. I guess the dosage response curve may be a little more forgiving then say 4 aco DMT, where 40 mgs can be twice as intense as 30 mgs. I guess I'll just use a scale and weigh up 0.075 and use it when I want to

So my 250 mgs of DPT arrived today....I have sterile syringes, stericups, sterile water. Unfortunately I don't have any micron filters. I'd still like to use this IM. the source I get it from has very high purity product, albeit probably not sterile. But I'm willing to risk it for the experience.


I still can't seem to find a good dosage guide. A lot of people have said 75-100 mgs IM. Is this for a breakthrough experience, or just a powerful tryptamine mushroom like trip? (Like 4 aco DMT seems to be at sub breakthrough doses)

You should probably have micron filters for IM, it would be safer to plug or snort it. I find snorting it works really well, especially if you can combo it with a tiny bit of dissociative like ketamine. Probably not a lot of bacteria thriving on your DPT sample, but it's going to be un-sterile for sure.

Yeah, I know. But honestly, I don't want to snort this. I would plug it, but due to intestinal issues, compounded by methadone constipation, it's not really a viable option for me at present. I personally think and IM injection shouldn't be as bad as IM'ing your average street drug. I knew bein on bl I'd be told to use a micron regardless, as it's good harm reduction.


After weighing the pros and cons,  I have decided to push forward, despite the pack of a micron filter. I will report back

Would u really recommend starting that low? I also tripped 7 days ago on 600 mics of ETH lad. And that's pretty standard for me. 25 mgs of IV 4 aco DMT was intense but manageable, and I did about 40 mgs IM and found that a little more intense, but peaked slower obviously. I have a 70 mg dose of dpt weighed up right now, maybe I'll try 40 ish mgs first. I just hate being underwhelmed, and having to wait for tolerance to clear to try again

60mg of impure/degraded DPT (it was the brown/red lousy batch that was going around ages ago - maybe it was 60-90% pure but I have no idea really) intranasally was pretty intense and otherworldly for me, I imagine 70mg of pure DPT IM would be utterly ass-kicking for myself. 40mg seems a better starting point for IM. Judging by your ETH-LAD doses 10-20mg does seem a bit on the light side if you don't want to take the chance of being underwhelmed. Probably the methadone is attenuating psychedelic effects for you. 300ug of ETH-LAD was my absolute upper limit, I doubt I could ever handle 450 let alone 600ug of it.


Your call obviously. Let us know how it goes.

Read the Tihkal I read. Plus if the 4-aco-dpt kicked my ass at such a low dose iv. It was more the physical discomfort. You can always take more never less

IM DPT is very strong. 70mhs is a higher end dose. One may not want to be introduced to something like DPT that way. IM'ing is the way I do most psychedelics. Like other simple tryps though it has little tolerance gain compared to other psyches. You can even redone on it and it will certainly bring the intensity up. It lasts a good 3-4 hours so you have time to make that choice. A dissociative and DPT is one of my top ranked psychedelic combos. 120mgs MXE plus 80 mgs DPT would lead me to places that were absolutely insane. I used to get 10gs of DPT and use IM in conjunction with MXE over the course of some months. Its one of my favorite add on to a trip. It will always hold a special place in my heart along with the other simple tryps!

So I think I'm gonna just do half of the 70 mg dose I have weighed up. This powder is white, crystalline, somewhat sticky, almost reminds me of icing sugar. I'm torn right now between going on an ETH LAD trip or a DPT trip. I'm thinking of saying to heck with it, waiting until late tonight, early morning, when I won't have any unwanted visitors, and IM 35-40 mgs of DPT


Is the nasal drip really that bad on this one? It certainly smells funky when burned/vape. I put a teeny tiny amount of a safety pin to see how it melted etc. And it stunk bad lol.

Its not pretty. Probably wise to lower the dose a bit. 70mgs is more than enough for a deep trip by itself IM. If you like smoking on psychedelics make sure to have some bud! DPT and getting stoned go very well together IMO. So even if 30mgs isn't exactly what you hoped for you can turn it up a notch or two anyways.I never liked snorting DPT or DMT. It never gave near as full bodied trip as smoking it or IM'ing it does. Plus it required a way higher dose....

Ya I picked up an eighth of some good pot too help nausea and hopefully synergize the effects. Thanks for the heads up. I'd have done the whole 70 mgs otherwise. I'll do half


What do you think Help?!?!? 30ish mgs IM is good enough? I think so, I, quite intimidated by dpt lol. I don't have the good mg scale I used earlier too weigh my 70 mgs. But I guess splitting it in half shouldn't be so bad, I think as long as I'm between 30-40 mgs I can handle it. I tripped 7 days ago on ETH lad, so I may have some residual tolerance.

I find Shulgins doses a little on the tame and cautious side for my tastes. Which is understandable. But i seem to have a natural tolerance too psychedelics. but with DPT I've decided to tread cautiously

Some of his doses are tame indeed. Yeah 40 mgs and some good pot will be enough. If you want do the rest after 45 minutes or so to bump it up. 40mgs and some good pot should be fun. DPT is indeed an insane rollercoaster like none other. That's why it has a special place in my heart!

What's a good starter dosage for DPT? I heard that DPT is very similar to DMT. Also is it best to snort it?

I'd be afraid of injecting it. Feels much worse. Like I'd be shooting up heroin or some shit haha. I'd rather snort and smoke things c: but hey that's exciting!. What made you wanna inject instead of doing it orally or snorting it? Or smoking?

Just because I can get a more powerful experience from less drugs. Also, I don't feel like putting up with the taste of sniffing or smoking. IV might be a bit much, so I've opted for IM

I honestly prefer IV, but if your afraid of coming up in one to five minutes don't try iv. I find Tryptamine to have a slight delay in the come up and gradually becomes stronger rather than being a rush and immediate effect. I honestly recommend to iv and if you're afraid of the come up start with a lower dose

Alright. I did 4 aco DMT IV and that was a ride. I think I will IV a small dose perhaps.....I noticed ppl have said it doesn't create much of a tolerance.....but if I took 600 micros of ethlad on Saturday afternoon, will it block the DPT until the tolerance clears? Or would IV DPT break right through the lysergamide tolserance build up?

The ETH-LAD will be giving you tolerance for a different, but overlapping, receptor profile (think venn diagrams for your receptor sites that get tickled by these drugs, there is a lot of overlap between the two, but it's not the same). You'll have a fair bit of tolerance, and you'd be best to wait.

Yeah I think it's best to snort it, but make sure to snort it very lightly as its a very light powder usually. It doesn't feel great in the nostrils, but once you accept it in there, it's fine. I like to snort, and then lie down on my back and trip out with some music playing for a while, with a blanket to stay warm - the combo of being sedentary and tryptamine can give some chills without one!


A good starting dose for snorted might be about 20mg. The most I ever did was 60mg, but it wasn't pure. That was quite heavy for me.


A lot of people like to vapourize it though. I find it to finicky and gross to vapourize, plus you have to convert it to freebase. So I just find it best to stick to snorting it. Probably plugging it is a good ROA too.

Alright. I'll wait a few more days. I actually did about 40-50 mgs  of 4 aco DMT IM a couple weeks ago, 4 days after tripping on ETH lad and had a breakthrough experience (aztec "gods", pyramids, clowns/jesters..a grey alien wearing an Indian head dress who seemed to make me calm telepathically) I was really surprised at how far I went, I was laying in bed in total darkness with some music at the time.

Nice.....I can't wait for my tolerance too go down too try this dpt. I actually desperately needed a rather long distance ride the other day too pick up a girl, and I paid my friend for the ride with about 80-90 mgs of my stash. Knocking me down to be about 160-170 mgs for myself. I just don't want to waste it. I think IV is my only option as far as getting the maximum experience from it.....but I'd be willing to increase the dose and IM

Why do you want to go IM instead of IV? Just curious. It seems safer to go IM in some ways because of the slower release, but on the other hand IV would be safer in terms of infection risk (I think).

I doubt the infection risk would be as much and IM would definitely be a more gentle come up, but I think IV would be worth it to be stronger.

IM does in fact have a much stronger infection risk because it's putting foreign material into a muscle which can cause an abcess.  Properly IVing something (ie, not missing) won't cause an abcess.  That's why with IM, it's especially important to use sterile procedures/sterile water and a micron/wheel filter.

I would go IM mostly because I like to be able to lie down etc. And get prepared a bit. Though like taco dude said, it might be like 4 aco DMT, and not have so much of a rush, but a full on come up over 5 mins when IV'd. That's how it was for me too. I felt it immediately, and rather then a 30 second flash that went away, like say IV cocaine, it just continued to get stronger over 5-10 minutes. I guess maybe I will IV it. Just to avoid the infection risk.


So what do u guys think as far as IV goes? Didn't u say start with 10-20 mgs IV tacodude? Or more? I don't want to be underwhelmed is all. As long as I get a strong ++ or +++ that's cool with me, just to get a feel for it. Is it that different from other tryptamines? Or is just the way ppl approach the experience psychologically that colours the trip?

I think it would be a good idea to dose low to assess the strength before trying to go for a full trip.... It's hard to tell what will be breakthrough and what won't

Ahhh, the beautiful unpredictability of psychedelics!


Edit****- so like I said, I dropped 600 mics of ETH lad on Saturday at 11 am. It is not almost 10:30 PM here, Tuesday night. What do u guys think? Could I get away with a shot of dpt? Or will the tolerance still be too strong? Say I IV or IM it?

Really as long as its properly prepared the risk of infection is low IM. Without a micron filter the risk elevates greatly. Muscular tissue isn't as readily able to filter things as well as blood. If your material is highly pure the risk truly isn't that great. In HR spirit I couldn't tell you to do it without. Ill admit that there's probably been a couple of times i didn't have a micron filter out of the hundreds of times I've IM'd. None really come to mind as I like to go in prepared but in all likelihood its happened. Its all about weighing the risk and if your willing to take that risk. I've never had an infection from IM'ing but i know its fairly easy to tell when somethings wrong after doing it. Some people may be confused by a sore muscle guiding them to think somethings wrong but you'd know within a few days. I've never IV'd DPT but the doses would be similar to IM maybe knocking off a couple mgs for just cause. I can tell you however that as long as you adjust to tolerance sake you'll still trip hard. If your prepared to possibly have your ads handed to you just up the dose accordingly. If your not feeling it strongly enough you can always redose.

So I've decided too 100 percent give it a go late tomorrow night/early morning the next day (think 3 am). So that will be 5 days since my lysergic experience (a strong one, felt the absolute, the yin and yang, you all know of which I speak).


None the less. I believe 5 days will be enough for me to blast off again. I intend to bring my cousin along for the ride. He also joined me in an experiment of IV 4 aco DMT.

So I have weighed out  60 mgs of dpt Hcl I'm planning on administering via IM in a couple of hours. My last trip was 5 days ago. I hope it's not too much. I guess I can start with half and redose. I have just under 200 mgs or so

So, I see why it's called the light....it was everything....and felt, I dunno, holy? Eternal? It was something else to say the least.

unfortunately, I seem to be really weird. I went through most of my material with IM injections. After 100 mgs IM and very little perceived effects after 2 hours, I proceeded to IV about 25 mgs, which for me was quite intense

I wonder it was something going wrong with the IM dose. Clean DPT doses aren't really that high especially when dosed via IM, IV, or smoked. It does have a very majestic feel to it. Its one my most revered psychedelics for that reason.

OntarioGuy seems to be a massive hardhead, and I think he mentioned he's on some kind of prescription opiate, which surely attenuates psychedelic effects.

Methadone has nothing to do with it. It could just be IM it's not very effective as I think that's the same as in tihkal. I knew IV would be the way to go.


You should also try to get come caapi, extract, or pure harmine to potentiate the dpt. Trust me do eet

Ya, sounds good.the harmine or Cappi I mean....I thought 100 mgs IM would do something, as in tihkal there's the account of someone breaking through on 100 mgs IM. (Though she was dying of cancer I believe, most likely weighed much less then me)


But the effects were minimal. If existent at all. But the product seemed pure, at least if how it dissolved clearly very easily can be used as a slight (however unreliable) indicator of purity. 


And ya I don't think the methadone has much too do with it. I remember when I was 13-14 years old I ate about 7 grams of cubensis, and my older friends were amazed I was walking around, functioning. So I just seem to have a natural tolerance. Which sucks at times dosage wise.....


But ya I think I will just IV dpt....but I so enjoyed 4-aco-DMT IM! I was hoping for a similar outcome with the IM dpt, maybe got my hopes too high


I also tried vaporizing some, with little to no effect....tasted horrendous, turned to a brown oil

You need to vape a good 100 mg in a hit... I remember when the people in the Nexus chat were messing with it and the "Avatar" doses. The consensus seemed to be too make herb infused with DPT to get a proper smoke of it.

Had my first full experience with DPT last weekend, insufflated 4mg of 3-meo-pcp in two bumps spaced 2 hours apart, then insufflated 30mg dpt split into five lines, to try to feel it as little as possible. Most of it felt like it fell on my palate/tonsils and burned there, not sure but figure that counts as wasted material. Felt rather caustic but it eventually all absorbed and the trip was starting around that time. 


Ultimately it was fairly weak, but quite enjoyable despite only faint visuals. I ended up getting very horny over the peak and found myself engaging in a bit of frottage and reached orgasm very easily that way. It had a bit of a feminine feeling to it too which was intriguing. I had some interesting (to me) thoughts about the visuals I could see and their geometrics. This idea I guess has been building in me for some time but came to a head during this trip. Basically I was recognizing the pattern occurring in my field of view as being that very common one where it's like the fovea is cut + pasted in overlapping circles (when looking at a textured surface). And also noted how my visual system was picking up on the edges of these circles, compounding the effect. Now the pattern I'm referring to is the one some people call the 'flower of life', and it made me think of a friend of mine who has a flower of life pendant, and something he said to me the other day about why he trips - "to see something beautiful", and it clicked. That symbol is like an identifier for people who put a lot of stock in what they can see, nice way of putting it would be they are visually focused, the way it came to me though was that they subscribe to the idea that seeing is believing. 


Good trip, thinking of trying the same dose plugged next time (though I might snort the 3-meo-pcp) which will hopefully be a little more efficacious.

You need to try a full trip either doing a full nasal line of better yet injecting it. If you can infused herb with it and get 100 mg in a hit that works too

I really relate to the femenine sexual feeling, I had a similar experience with DPT, definitely the closest I have been in my life to the experience of a femenine orgasm. 

I just took the stuff twice, second time I used MXE as a launchpad as with no dissociative the bodyload was quite unbearable, and I plugged to avoid the drip which is very bad too, probably the worst I had. I think plugged DPT is a bit wasteful, but the absense of a drip might very well be worth the money if you've got enough product. 50mg in 3 shots plugged every 20 min were definetely weaker than around 35mg insufflated in one go. My impression is that might be half as potent plugged than insufflated, but I would need more experiences to be sure about that and I felt like the MXE took a lot of the bite out of it, in any case much more enjoyable, makes it extremely smooth, while on its own it is far too rough. In any case YMMV and I think it is quite alright to redose DPT to get where you want to be. Next time I might try a bit over 50mg plugged in one go to avoid any instant tolerance that might had happened and redose from there if needed.

I've been experimenting with infused herb recently. I'm probably using too much herb as I get a couple bowl fulls out of it. Any tips for getting 100mg in a single hit besides just use less herb?

Dissolve DPT in 99% iso, evaporate over smallest amount of possible, once dry scraper all the residue that didn't dry on the leaf in hopes it just sticks to the surface of the lead, and then smoke it out of an EMPTY DRY bong with a glass screen, a lil bit of regular herb, 125 mg dpt worth of infused leaf, and a little more herb and use hemp wick to burn it with a plate next to you to put the wick in case you can't get it out in time. Hold it in for 30-60' seconds if you can and be sure to not put water in the bong so you can pull the air evenly and not in little spurts like pulling through water causes.


If that doesn't work dunno what would besides IV I honestly highly recommend as it's nice to just fall into a trip without worrying about smoking stress

Yeah I'm not big on smoking psychedelics, never had a good experience with smoked DMT anyway, and I would never do anything IV, that's really out there man. Mayyyybe IM but I have no idea how to prep a shot and I would like it to stay that way. I may end up going back to nasal if my plugged experiment is disappointing. I thought 30 mg was a full dose though? Plus I was on 3-meo-pcp so wanted to keep it low regardless, that definitely caused some significant potentiation.


Does anybody know about the bioavailability of drips? All the material stayed on my palate so I wouldn't think it should be treated as oral, would it be like buccal? Can dpt be taken that way?


I'm glad someone related to the feminine feeling lol I was worried I'd come back to the thread and people would just be like 'lol, gay'. I'm intensely curious as to what in the brain could be responsible for something like that, some sort of disinhibition obviously but it's so damn specific to that aspect it's weird haha.

Yeah, I've just been puffing on it in a glass bowl like I would regular herb. It works, but it'll take quite a few hits to get 100mg. I can imagine one big bong rip hitting much harder.

IM DPT is very effective. Its pretty rare that IM anything falls much lower than 90% BA. I haven't been posting much in the last year or so but people who know me know I routinely use very high doses of psychedelics and usually in combos with others. I routinely vaped 100mgs of DMT or more of snow white DMT I extracted myself. I've IMd 250mgs of it before. These were higher doses with the IM dose being extremely strong(it was done on 2 hits of good LSD and 20mgs of 2c-E....). DPT(neither is DMT...) isn't that potent if its not smoked, rectally, IMd, or IVd. If it is then its about as potent as DMT if not more. I've used many simple tryptamines and this is one of the more potent ones used by those means. It can scare many people off in fact. It doesn't have a transcdent reputation for nothing..... 100mgs for most will be a breakthrough or near it without tolerance and a normal natural tolerance. My favorite dose was 120mgs on its own. I used to LOVE 80mgs mixed in with 120mgs of MXE IM. Insane. Be careful throwing large doses out there acting like their nothing. This isn't good HR for new users looking for dosage information....

This morning I woke up early and felt that it was time to do DPT again.  I've taken it plenty of times in the 10-25mg range and had 3 trips where  I took around 60-70mg, and I wanted to try an in-between dose. A  strong, but not quite breakthrough dose. I snorted 45mg, a little bit every few minutes, and felt warmth and euphoria growing inside of me. I had an  empty stomach and decided to eat a peach. As I bit into it, I almost  felt like I was going to have an orgasm. Then I laid in bed and waited  for the effects to fully develop.


To my surprise, 45mg was enough  for the full-on DPT experience. Complete ego death and immersion in  colorful geometric patterns. The trip became unpleasant and I was very  uncomfortable for what felt like a long time. I couldn't break free from  feelings of anxiety and loneliness. The DPT irritating my nasal cavities  combined with my allergies made me unable to breath through my nose and  I felt like I was suffocating. Eventually though, I experienced a  catharsis, and the rest of the trip was great.


DPT is so  fascinating in the way it completely disassembles you. The archetypal  imagery, free associations, primal instincts... I won't even attempt to  describe it all. Like my other DPT trips, this one was was focused on  religious and sexual themes. This trip really reinforced the  idea that, biologically, men are meant to be dominant over women. I  don't mean to offend anybody, that's just my perspective as a man,  stripped down to my most basic instincts by a psychedelic drug. I'd love  to hear other people's perspectives on the dominance/submission aspects of DPT, especially a woman's.

Man, you make me really want to try a higher dose of this one. At this time of my life I am more interested in sex and relationships than before in life. I have a good amount to work with and when I tried a low dose I would describe it as having a sacred or holy vibe to it. Maybe try a high oral dose for the new year, my nose is wrecked from doing a lot of H for years so I am unsure what the next best roa would be. I hear in capsules it is inefficient.

i never tried insulfation with DPT. I tried to vape the HCL twice, then tried plugging it and never tried anything else. I would usually use 20-50mg. Almost always I combined it with a dissociative, and sometimes with other psychedelics, mostly 2c-x. 


I never really dosed more than 50mg at a time, although I would do multiple doses with like 20,30,30mg or something like that. 50mg to me was the upper limit on "i might lose my shit with more than this", except one time I took like 120mg with some mdma and that was... something.

Plugging DPT was not efficient whatsoever for me. Brown batch. Insufflation was at least twice as strong.

Hi guys,

I'm asking here if anyone has ever become addicted to this RC from your experience or people you know?


Years ago i tried mdma and i loved it. I always felt this push but after a few months it stopped and I lost my cravings and interest for more of it.

These days, I do psychedelics whenever it comes up, and although shrooms and acid is great and all but i've never ever had this itch to do more "just because".

That's until i came accross DPT. My experience with it was so outrageously amazing that i just can't seem to stop remeniscing about all the cool phenomenons happening inside my brain when I was on it.

I tried it twice half a year ago but I still have cravings for more, cravings i can ascribe (from my very limited experience) only to MDMA, but they're somehow stronger. On the comedown of my second and last dpt trip i even wrote in my notebook  ?don't ever do this drug again, it is very addictive?.


The reason i'm curious is because judging by all the reports i've read on this forum(and others) is that for the majority at least, DPT isn't supposed to be so mesmerising. People say it's cool but they compare it to acid or similar psychedelics, pretty harmless and non-addictive, but to me it's even more heavy duty.

Does anyone feel the same way as me?

I think most people consider DPT to be one of the most intense and "special" psychedelics, which can also make it frightening for some.  I've never really heard anyone say they were addicted to DPT before.  What about it is addictive to you?  I have felt addicted to psychedelics at another point in my life, never DPT specifically (for me it was AMT, DOC, various 2C-Xs)... I just really was fascinated by them and wanted to do them as often as possible, and did do they way too often eventually.  I still am fascinated with them, but after many years I started to appreciate how it's only so special if you don't do it all the time and make it your new normal.


I mean if you just crave that intensity of psychedelic experience, that's kinda normal among those of us who really like psychedelics.  You said you've only done it twice in the last 6 months?  That's quite good.  I crave the psychedelic state too, but there's plenty of time for that and if you don't start doing it too much it'll always be great.  You seem like you're doing well now, so just keep it up.  ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Even though it's far from the truth, it for some reason feels like the best thing i've ever done (lol). I love the feeling of rush and insane visions. It produces a lot of psychological sensations, frequent states of arousal and constant output of either realistic human scenes or surreal scenes, talking mountains, neon creatures, and all other things that are too complex and personal for me to explain and condense in this forum post. 

Have you personally tried dpt?

Funny thing is, I feel the same way as you about all other psychedelic experiences except only for DPT. Almost all were very positive experiences but since they lasted for many hours I always felt mentally exhausted afterwards and in need of some experience integration. Only after a couple of months I would even begin to start thinking about maybe taking another hit at a right oppurtunity.

In a way you could say i 'crave' other psychedelics too, since otherwise I wouldn't be doing them at all, but I just think crave is too strong of a verb to describe that IMO.

But how would that would explain plenty of my intense LSD experiences that I wouldn't particularly 'crave' to repeat?

Yeah, you'd think after 6 months i would forget about it all but it's like i've got this small invisible leprachaun telling me how dpt was awesome and how it would totally be cool to try it again.

Anyways, I'm sticking to acid for now if or when I decide to trip next time.

I wouldn't say I'm addicted to DPT, but I totally relate to your  fascination with it. It really is special and mesmerizing in a way that  other psychedelics aren't. I'm a little obsessed with psychedelics in  general but there's something unique about DPT that draws me to it. I  use it more often than any other drug,  sometimes several times a month, usually at low doses. I feel that DPT  is the most useful and versatile psychedelic out there and I've  benefited greatly from using it, but I can see how using it without any  restraint could be harmful. It's probably not physically addictive in  any way but people can be addicted to anything, even psychedelics. If  you feel that taking DPT again is a bad idea you should go with your  gut.

^ What is your ROA of choice? I'm getting some soon, and from what I gathered insufflation is the most effective ROA? I don't really like snorting stuff very much so I was thinking of IM.

I always heard that IM is the best for DPT because it's much smoother and more pleasant than snorting.  Some people on here also swear by plugging if it's a salt (I think it generally is these days, right?)

In regards to snorting, I'm just sharing my own limited experience, so take it for what it's worth.

It was this exact DPT (part1 or 2) thread that i read someones advice regarding snorting, that somehow got ignored by the rest but for me it really benefited me when I tried it. I cannot be bothered to dig it up but I can only attest that it worked as advertised. 


So my first try ever, i snorted a fat line pretty eagerly and firmly. My nose burned so bad that I constantly imagined i was bleeding out of my nostril, i was checking and fingering my nose every minute (to make sure it's OK). 

It was very uncomfortable to say the least, so the second time (two weeks later) I took a completely opposite approach. I gently sniffed it, so that the powder barely reached my nostrils. The line had to be slim and insufflation very precise. When I've completed the procedure, the nostril still felt stuffed right away (obviously) but the whole experience was just so much better to the point where I would almost say I had no issue's at all. Ok, I had a bad taste in my mouth but if that wasn't so light, i would've simply washed it off with a juice or something (depending on how capable i would be in those situations haha).

Nice, that's good advice, I actually occasionally like to snort 2C-Xs in low dosages, and if you do it in little bumps, it doesn't burn too much.  But if you do it all in one go it's awful.

Yes, I absolutely love DPT. It has profoundly changed my life more than any other psychedelic, save DMT. I used to have addictions to both of them. I actually just posted a trip report about a reflection of mine on the addictive nature of DMT. DPT is great, and I found it to be the perfect tryptamine for revelatory bliss as well as ego-shattering experiences. A lot of people complained about the body load of DPT, but I really love it and found it to be tantalizing. I find that the quality of synthesis with DPT matters a lot, as I got some once that was an off-white, slightly yellow color (all of the others I'd gotten were pure white), that gave me a lot of tension and didn't feel the same as the other batches.

DPT is the most reinforcing psychedelic I have ever used. I went through 10 grams of DPT in 5 months, using compulsively almost every evening. I moved into the forest in the summer of 2018, and from then on till Xmas and new year I spent almost every night in dipropyl space. It’s definitely very moreish.


After my 10 grams was out, I was fiending for more, but the vendor was no longer selling. There’s no physical dependence, but the psychological desire lasted. I still would like to get some more, although I don’t crave it anymore.


I would compare DPT’s addictive potential to be on par with that of ketamine, which I was once addicted to. It even has a dash of low-dose ACH style dissociation as part of its effect profile, in my experience.


Not overwhelmingly so, but a touch of anaesthetic, disembodied feeling is there. The stuff even numbs your mouth like an anaesthetic.

^Absolutely incredible.  To think someone could get addicted to DPT is crazy,  to me it is so jarring to scary to reborn type experince it is nothing I think to do again real quick. But it is an important psychedelic that should be utilized by experienced trippers.  Early Aug is almost like a ritual for me, although I missed the last 2 years. I settled on early August as a ritual because my first time was around that time period, second half of Summer. I think it is unique in how the visuals start off as shakes and tremors, then progress to seeing and feeling.  Vibrations are converted to sensory output.  It is one psychedelic that I have to be alone and late at night.  No way could I run into another human being.  Certainly not a social one.  2-CB seems more social for social activities.  Even acid is.


Thanks to the last 2 posters on the info. Too interesting. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) (I have only seen white as far as he powder,, never any other color although I read about different colors in this thread)

That description of the vibrations turning into synesthesia is very familiar, literal jolts of electricity. Shake hard enough and you'll see a tesla coil slamming you with lightning ripping through the fabric of space and time.


That stuff was so gentle, calming and amazing the first time I took it in a combination with dxm and mushrooms, the second time was a very low dosage, only ~25 mg or so, but it felt like it was a gram. The drip is so terrible, that remained throughout the whole trip. Felt like I had advanced parkinsons, could not stop shaking, in terror almost, lol. It wasn't even a bad trip, just frighteningly beautiful and confrontationally physical. The third time was treshold, smoked about 15 mg of the freebase, had some of that same warmth the first time had, but it wasn't enough to give me much insight into what a smoked/vaporized experience really is like.


That's the only way I'll ever be taking it again though, DPT has forever put me off snorting drugs. Permanent gag reflex.

I have yet to try DPT, though I have enough for plenty of experimentation.  I've always been afraid because back in the day in early Internet trip reporting, it was almost universally described as very difficult, though rewarding.  Something about it makes me feel cautious which is why I have yet to taste it.

Kinda like how I always looked at DMT, something I needed to be "ready" for, which is kinda bs, why not just do it, right? ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif) I think it's a lot less difficult than something like ibogaine, which is something that really terrifies me from what I've read about it, yet both can be as equally therapeutic. I think you can get way more useful introspection and evaluation done on DPT than with most other psychedelics available.

Yeah I'm sure I overblow it in my mind.  For the record though my ibogaine flood dose was not frightening, in fact during the peak (which was like 2 days long) I had no idea most of the time I had taken ibogaine or that my dreams weren't real.  Primarily ibogaine is an oneirogen... it works like dreams do, very subconscious, deep stuff.  But like a guide, you feel like it's wanting to help you.  I did experience some intense fear when coming back to reality (but only partly) the third day because no one was with me and I became sure it was actually 5 days after I took it and not 3 and that my brain had broken.  But that passed and I wasn't scared anymore, once my friend got there.  I wasn't scared because of the effects.  They were overwhelmingly intense, but unthreatening.  It was dreaming whether awake or asleep.


I took a good portion of my dose as the TA extract which contains other highly psychoactive, related alkaloids which I think gave me a fuller and better experience than most reports of clinic sessions say.  Like many people say it was physically painful and their heart was racing... for me, it felt wonderful physically, when I was aware of my body, it felt like that feeling when you wake up halfway in the middle of the night and have that sleep narcosis, your body is so heavy and warm and you're like yessssss I get to fall asleep again now.

Thinking about ordering this instead of the fat bag  of 4-EMC I'd planned on this week, still not sure. But like Dorky I've had the opportunity to get this one for a decade but I've always been hesitant due to early reports but these last ages have got me so interested. And obviously if I buy this it's going to be in my stash for years instead of months I'll probably have a lifetime supply of the stuff. Wanna try Vaping the HCL in light doses like I've been doing with my DMT. Pretty sure I'd be into it as I never came across a psychedelic I didn't see value in. Though I'd admittedly skipped things like 5-MeO-AMT back in the day and Bromo-Dragonfly.


But even though this stuff has me apprehensive I'd think I would Vape the stuff for sure after meditating for 5-10 mind like I do before DMT. I find that really helps to put me in the right place before the short acting psychedelics that catapult you into other realms. Feel like all my DMT use as of late has made me ready for DPT finally and I wanna scratch this of my list for sure at some point, they based a religion off the stuff and there has to be a pretty good reason for that.

DPT is pretty cool. It's super deep. I like how it's pretty short-acting, but can totally rock your world. It's a more challenging psychedelic and probably more for the experienced tripper than the newb. For some reason vaping it always felt super unnatural and creeped me out, so I stick to snorting it (which is smooth), but sounds like you're already used to vaping. 

It's perhaps the most music-enhancing psychedelic I've tried.

Interesting... I have the HCL, snooting was always my plan as I don't want to waste my gram converting to freebase... but it sounds painful. Is it less painful than I think?

You can Vape the HCL or snort it from what I've read dont think I'd bother converting the stuff. And assume it will be much more stable as the HCL which would be another reason to leave it as is. Maybe I will try sniffing it first as all of you initiated do seem to favor it that way. The people who I've read using it for years seem to talk of doing lines bbn usually. Nice to have the options and I will probably give both a whirl as time goes by. And as for pain after sniffing the 2C-x I'm sure this isnt so bad in comparison. Super curious about this stuff, I'd start pretty low tho it sounds like some alien dimension sorta stuff you wanna ease into.

Not sure if that was a typo, but I love that word snooting  ![:LOL:](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f606.png) 


Yeah I don't find it bad at all, but I don't have a lot of experience snorting drugs to compare it to. I think I might have only snorted this, ketamine and 5-MeO-DMT. I find it less painful than 5-MeO-DMT, for reference. I do remember that I added a touch of ketamine to it when I snorted a large amount (60mg) and that might have made it more comfortable by dissociating me a little bit.


Converting to freebase is very simple using the baking soda method, and is recommended if you do try to vape it - I found it way smoother and less toxic-burny than HCl. Nonetheless I ended up sticking with "snooting" ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

It was intentional, but I'm not original, I think I got the word from an episode of it's always sunny where Frank says something about snooting some 'riteral' (i.e. a word mixture of ritalin/adderal) when they were at a frat house I think.

DPT doesn't really burn per se, it definitely feels like an irritant, but the drip just keeps going and going for hours, it's absolutely disgusting imo.


Ibogaine has the added luxury of axtually working on opiate receptors too, so I get it's great for addiction cessation, but the real change still needs to come from the therapeutic side? Or is it actually rewiring regardless of realizations and desires? I still think it's scarier than DPT, lol.

It felt like it was rewiring my subconscious, when I did a flood dose.  Of course I was really, really ready to be done with opiates, and afterwards I made a lot of changes to my daily life.  But I came out of the experience with a strong drive to get in shape, eat well, and never touch opiates again, that was not there before, and it wasn't like I had some big realization, I had a bunch of abstract dreams that were representative of my bad patterns, but it seemed to be working on a dreaming sort of level.

I have a bit of this kicking around, the snorting sounds nasty. Thinking about doing a baking soda /crack type conversion I saw but little worried I will ruin it. Some people say smoking the salt works other people say its a waste. Almost thinking of trying it with MAOI, propyl-huasca though that has it's own issues

My friend & I are planning to take DPT in the next couple of days, what's a good plugged dose for a first time? He's more experienced than me with psychedelics but I've tripped more with him than anyone else and it will be at my house so I feel pretty comfortable about it. I've read a lot about it and I realize DPT is a pretty upper-echelon stuff in terms of intensity/uniqueness but the dissociative character has always appealed to me, perhaps in a misleading way just because I'm so comfortable with dissociatives. But I've been in a pretty good place mindset-wise the past couple weeks so it seems right.


I was thinking rectal admin. because there seems to be a preponderance of negative physiological effects with insufflation, perhaps that's because so many of the reports I've found seem to be dosing rather high. Anyways, the few rectal DPT reports I've found make it sound like a smoother ROA if less potent than insufflation.


Right now I'm thinking eating maybe 10mg of deschloroketamine to help with the body load, waiting 30 minutes in and then plugging maybe 20-30mg of the DPT. Perhaps I should lean towards the higher end of that range, or even perhaps a little higher? My friend may just want to snort his, which 30mg nasally seems like a pretty strong dose already from many of the reports I've read.

In my experience snorting DPT was like how I imagine snorting battery acid would feel....even in a saline solution the pain from insuflation was extreme.

The 2c-x series has a reputation for being legendary in terms pain when snorting so I agree ...its not worse than the 2c-x 's.

I'm astonished that some people can actually tolerate putting this stuff up their nose. 

I would never even attempt to snort 2c-anything based on what I've read and i certainly will never ever attempt to snort DPT again.

What i find very strange though is that 4-ho-dpt fumarate is like snorting air...zero burn at all.

This makes me wonder if DPT fumarate would be significantly less painful than DPT hcl? I've only ever seen DPT in its hcl form and never the fumarate...I've always wondered why that is? Is it more difficult to freebase as the fumarate salt?

Please do check which type of DPT you have if it's no trouble... part of me suspects its possibly the hydrochloric acid part that's making it burn so bad when insufflating it...but now that I'm typing this I'm just realizing that MXE was made as the hcl salt if I'm not mistaken and that stuff has zero burn when snorting as well....maybe you have an iron nose!

I generally only will snort MXE or 4-ho-dpt and really only those two because it's a superior route of administration (especially for 4-ho-dpt) and it's not extremely uncomfortable to do so.

I should also point out that my partner also tried snorting DPT as the powder and in saline solution and her eyes were beat red and in tears for like 30mins...not the best way to start a psychedelic trip imho.

When I snorted DPT it was really bad. Thinking back 2Cs probably burn more but DPT has this annoying way to sticking around. With 2Cs the burn eventually eases off and doesn't bother me after 15 minutes. DPT on the other hand burns nearly as badly and lingers. It has an awful smell/taste and plugged up my nose until the next day. The next day I actually had mild nose bleeding which is very unusual for me. Granted during that time I was really abusing my sinuses so it might not be as bad for someone that isn't snorting drugs daily.


That said, it's bearable and I found more value with it through that ROA than I did vaping/smoking it. Mine was supposed to be the hcl but who knows if that's what I ended up with. The batch I got was an off-yellow color and smelled really bad. I'd compare it to what people say is an unclean extraction of DMT. So my product might not have been the same as what other people have gotten. I see a lot of reports with white DPT that is said not to be as hard on the sinuses.


If I get this one again I'd probably IM it just to avoid the sinus problems. I am terrified of needles so that should give you an idea of how opposed to snorting it again I am. People have said it has less body load when IMed. DPT's body load is really rough so anything to calm it down would be a positive. I think MGS put it best when it said it's like sucking on an electrical cord. I described it similarly; "it's like having lighting bolts thrown at you by God".


I still rank DPT as my strongest and most valuable drug experience. I think this one is a great candidate for further research. I feel like it would be good for addiction therapy. It certainly was for me.

DPT was one of the most important, and difficult, psychedelic experiences of my life.


It deconstructed me down to nothing, and emotionally wrecked me afterwards as a result. But that deconstruction lay the roots for a massive psychological shift. It took around two years to mostly recover, and I can still feel tendrils of it lurking about in my self, but I wouldn't give it back for anything.


I was as "spiritually attuned" as I'd ever felt, finally ready to try DPT, but instead of bringing me to higher, more expansive states, it just destroyed everything I thought about myself and the world. It broke everything into the tiniest of pieces, and left me emotionally dead for months, wounded for longer.


I'm sure, I know, it doesn't do the same for everybody. But damn, it can get you.


Also, as painful as insufflation was, rectal administration didn't seem to do shit for me.

Rectal administration of both dpt and 4-ho-dpt wsy not successful for me at all but I'm not very experienced with that ROA and only used it for MXE (which is the best ROA for that chemical by far) . But its possible that my bowels were not empty or whatever because I would assume if nasal administration works so should rectal. However, I think ketamine dies not work very well rectally for some reason even though nasal works great for it.

For myself, I found that oral administering of DPT worked perfectly but there was definitely nausea at the very end of the trip.

I'll contribute my notes for research purposes. I snorted (snooted?) my way through a few grams of DPT HCL after I stopped drinking after a 10 year long relapse.


I think the HCL is what screws up your nose. I can confirm the taste is terrible. I ended up rinsing my sinuses with tap water 10 minutes or so after snorting to deal with it.  That doesn't completely solve the drip problem, and clogging, which I can confirm was a real thing every time I used it.


The reason I wanted to try DPT was reports about 'the light'.  +/- 150mg could get me pretty close to the full body electrical feeling mentioned by someone else above. I will note that DPT had a very noticeable body load for me in that it feels kind of pleasurable, not euphoric, but body oriented at any dosage. 150mg also gives you a 'there's no way out now' psychedelic immersion feeling where you mentally pull down the safety bar and keep your hands and feet inside the car until the ride ends and the car comes to a complete stop. It could produce heavy fractals and other times dreamlike hallucination sequences.  It was never sinister or scary or nightmarish for me, other trip reports about DPT being scary caused more anxiety than the DPT itself.  The downside was that I think I had maybe 1 1/2 to 2 trips that were like this. Sorry to say most trips were not like that, and other than the cool body load, pretty uneventful, dissociative, and not really worth it tbh.

I have no idea, but I know it wasn't too strong. About a medium dose, maybe slightly above. The effects from the substance were strong, but only in the way that you'd say a full psychedelic experience is strong. I've been way higher on other substances. I think it was where I needed to go, so just as much me as the substance.

Just checked.. mine is the HCl. I swear it's not too bad to snoot. Maybe some of the DPT HCl out there has excess HCl kicking around, making it acidic and painful?

I highly, highly doubt the HCl is the issue. Many tryptamines, for instance, are HCl and don't burn. Most drugs are in HCl form and don't burn.

Like I said in an above post MXE hcl had zero burn so I'm leaning towards it being the actual DPT thats causing the pain...strange though that 4-ho-dpt is painless to insufflate

I feel the same way about plugging it. I only it tried it once I think. I put in a hefty bit of it with MXE hoping it would be a more gentle experience. All I got with a typical non-hole MXE experience from what I remember. I just recall thinking the DPT did little if anything to add to it.


[@The Axe](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/522310/) You description of "the light" is the type of experience I had. My first time with DPT was terrifying for the first part but then shifted into a very positive and power experience. For me the body load eased off once I got into the second phase of my trip. I think the trick was finding an outlet for the energy. It bothered me when I tried to lay in bed. I just kept shaking and I couldn't relax my muscles. For whatever reason IMing is reported to get rid of that side effect all together.


I think the terrifying part of my trip on it had to do with who I was and what I was doing in my life at the time. Someone with fewer problems and a more honest way of living probably wouldn't find it as difficult as I did. I bet I would enjoy it a lot more now than I did that time. The positive part of the trip was the most at peace I've ever been in my life.


Did you guys take it outdoors or indoors? The reason I ask is because the bad part of my trip was when I was indoors. Once I got outside it was like a switch flipped. If I ever did it again I'd want to do it during a sunny day or during one of those 2-3 hour long severe thunderstroms. I've wondered if it could be used as a hiking drug at the right dose.


I didn't have enough material when I had this one around so all my other experiences with were very low doses vaping it plus that failed attempt to plug it.

My experience mirrors his, I did about 120-150mg. I know that's a wide range but at the time I didn't have the proper scale. I split what was sold to me as 250mgs. For all I know it could have been way more in there. Sorry I can't give you an exact measurement back then I wasn't practicing proper HR.

Whatever the reason for this I really hate it. Smoking it felt more like a wacky DMT to me. I wasn't doing very big doses but I just didn't like the effects compared to snorting it. Plus it wore off so quickly and I hate smoking random chemicals. Smoking/Vaping any of this stuff can't be healthy. I need to save my lungs for the use of tobacco. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) If you were willing to inhale like 100mg at one time I wonder what would happen. I don't think anyone has ever reported doing that.

I was indoors, after the sun had gone down. I could totally see that being a key factor in my experience. 


There was something about my DPT experience that was very raw. On every other psychedelic that I've taken, there's always a sense of the divine, or of some kind of aliveness that feels inherently comfortable in some way, like an always-present-if-looked-for awareness of basic goodness, or of life itself that again, feels like a kind of existential blanket. On DPT, there was none of that. I felt completely exposed to the coldness of the world, totally raw and vulnerable. It was like riding on the cold knives edge of reality, or in some moments more accurately, a cold cheese grater.

Now that I think about it some more I was indoors on the bathroom floor for the initial high dose trips and did them during the day.  The uncontrollable body shaking made me apprehensive at first because it almost feels like a seizure, but its in the body and limbs, there weren't any brain zaps or anything like that, so after I felt I wasn't going to have a stroke or some such thing I could calm down and really enjoy the experience.   Completely exposed, raw, and vulnerable is a good way to describe it, at least for the first shaking part (maybe 15 minutes to a 1/2 hour long?).  Your body is kind of locked so there's a sense of powerlessness but at the same time there were hints of 'the light' so it was pretty exhilarating. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who hasn't been through some at least some difficult psychedelic experience before because you'll need to have some mental tools at the ready just in case.

So I titrated my way up orally. 


I’m not sure why I didn’t make notes but iirc my last oral dose was 200 mg with a decent dose of dxm as a launch pad. There wasn’t much beyond the given dose of dxm (which I also don’t remember ffs lol)


But I digress, with my stock dwindling  I want to try a more effective ROA but I’m seeing conflicting reports for both in and ir.


the thought of “snooting” (lol) something nearly as painful as 2cx makes me cringe something fierce - that was an awful way to begin such a powerful psychedelic experience. Yet pd says their experience with in isn’t a big deal ... 


I’ve read the big and dandy(?) guide to plugging and it seems simple enough. Yet some reports here indicate dpt is ineffective boofed.


Not entirely sure what I’m hoping for in response... but I’d like to try this again soon and I’m uncertain which route to choose... will update after my experience... in the meantime any insight is appreciated

I've been meaning to try this orally shortly after taking either b. caapi or s. rue.


I had tried snooting and it wasn't that bad if you do it gently. It just didn't seem to be that effective for me regardless.

I'm damn excited to try this, I would guess that an insufflated dose <50mg would be good to start off? And that redosing still works well in like the first hour of dosing?

Yeah I hoovered the 150mgs and it was so fucking intense and bright. Mentally I didn't have much profound happen, but it was truly a glorious experience. All I'll say, at that dose its a lot of powder and the effect on my sinuses was really the most distracting part of the trip, but otherwise it was amazing.

I tried 40 mg of DPT orally after a soup made from 30 gr of caapi, IIRC. I might have used too little caapi, since it never passed the threshold level.

I've used DPT several times, with ranges from 20 to 80 mg (i.m.). The body high was very uncomfortable each time : convulsions, undescribable (but not pleasant) feelings from inside the body, gag reflex kicking in on its own, strange pepper-like taste in mouth, overall not very recreational for me. I am forced to lie on my side for 15-30 minutes and repeatedly go in mini-dreams that only last a few seconds.


Definitely a very powerful experience. Not sure how some of you even consider doing it outside, if anybody were to see me in that state, they'd call an ambulance immediately ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

DPT really is one of the best there is!! I don't know for sure, but it might be my favorite!  I mean it has everything you'd want in a really good acid trip compressed down to just a couple hours. DPT really does remind me more of LSD than any other tryptamine I've tried. Way closer to LSD than any 4 subbed tryptamines.  That's just my opinion though. Something about the DPT headspace to me that is very LSD like. The visuals can be insane too and of course it's dose dependent.


Did you know that you can redose DPT? I have redosed it many many times and never noticed any noticeable tolerance at doses of like 75-90mg intranasally.  That dose kicked my ass every time even when I was coming down from the last dose.  I once stayed tripping continuously on DPT for 24 hours. I've tripped for 24 hours before, however, not tripped that HARD for 24 hrs before.


Anyone else blacked out on it before?  I was drinking some whiskey and did 100mg line of DPT and blacked out for awhile. Apparently I did some stupid shit like pee on the floor in the kitchen.

I wonder what makes some psychedelics cause sharp increases in tolerance while other like DPT seem almost infinitely redosable to me.  Take 5-meo-DALT for instance. It's a bizarre trip. Intensely psychedelic mind and body space with pretty much no visuals. It is really short so when I came down I felt cheated almost and tried redosing. It seems like I had to use twice or three times as much to get high again. With DPT no increase in dose is necessary for redosing.  It's great because the short duration of DPT is also conducive to redosing.


I really understand why the Church of Inner Light chose DPT.  It's really one of the most complete and well rounded psychedelics there is!

Are you saying DMT is similar in being redosable or similarly well rounded? I haven't tried it yet but believe me it's on the short list. Would be interesting to try some other non 4 or 5 subbed typtamines like MET or maybe EPT or something.

The tolerance building seems quite random on dmt.

Sometimes i can hit several breaktroughs in a row.

But other times tolerance builds but then also goes away fast.

I’ve had 500mg of this for many years now. Too afraid to touch it after reading so many scary reports. But I’m well experienced with powerful psychs, including 2 very profound and successful toad ceremonies. I’m seeing some people say this is a gem and others say it’s a terror. I think I have hcl. How to go about having an experience with this? Is it something you can enjoy at low dose to get a feel for or is it more all or nothing, like toad/5-meo is for me?

But I’m well experienced with powerful psychs, including 2 very profound and successful toad ceremonies. I’m seeing some people say this is a gem and others say it’s a terror. I think I have hcl. How to go about having an experience with this? Is it something you can enjoy at low dose to get a feel for or is it more all or nothing, like toad/5-meo is for me?

I believe you can definitely enjoy it at a lower dose, although I haven't tried myself (only 1 trip at 100mg which was extremely enjoyable), that's my impression at least. 

Dosage wise, I read somewhere that you could compare it to the same amount of say 4-AcO-DMT.


There won't be any terror with getting your feet wet, that's for sure ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I plugged 11mg while on a bunch of MXiPr and it was quite immersive at that dose, I was basically out of commission for an hour, and when I came to I plugged some 2C-C which ended up being more way more psychedelic than usual, which I kind of attributed to the DPT, although the MXiPr probably contributed as well.


I'd like to take some again soon actually (I'm thinking 20-25mg) and combine it with a much smaller dose of a dissociative than last time, but given DPT's reputation I think I'll have a trip sitter. All that is to say that I like building up camaraderie with any substance, and lower doses are a great way to do that.

What’s the benefit of combining with a disso? I have K and dmxe on hand. K does usually add a nice anxiolytic component for me but besides enjoying dissociatives is there a special synergy with dpt and a disso? [@Buzz Lightbeer](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/509667/) you took it without any combo? What ROA?

I insufflated it, no combo, it doesn't burn much at all (HCl salt), slight discomfort. IM is supposed to be the much superior ROA though. Smoking a small amount might help you get a feel for it as well.

I'm actually of the maybe slightly controversial opinion that adding dissos comes at a cost, though I would like to think that some ketamine can help you let go of the physical aspect at higher doses, possibly bringing it into even more epic territory. I just think it's good practice to get to know DPT first before adding stuff, but all reports indicate that there is real synergy.


All that said, DPT is truly badass and whatever you end up doing, it will be memorable ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I'm not sure i.m. is all that great, it takes maybe 15-30 minutes to reach the peak. It's not fun losing your sanity over that long of a period. I would try i.v. but it dissolves to an oily substance and those aren't recommended for i.v..


I tried it once with ketamine, it was a catastrophe. The durations/onset didn't match at all (my fault). There was no positive combination of effects, the ketamine wore off before the DPT peaked with the residual dissociation and its side effects. Potentially dangerous too, as I puked while passed out.

My issue with dpt is that there seems to be such a small margain between to low and to high of a dose.


All my lowish trials has been underwhelming but interesting.

Mostly get typical tryptamine visuals and body load etc.


But there seems to be no middle ground here, no +++ so to speak.

For me at least its gone from "nothing special, ill take some more"

To "holyshit, not again"  both times ive done more then one or two small bumps.


The only real nice exp ive had with dpt was combined with ket at festival.

(Low dose)

Well I just recently got a new sample of DPT from a friend of mine, 120mgs to be exact. Trying to figure out the best way to use it and get two experiences if possible. Planning on using it Intranasal which I have done once in the middle of a multi day psychedelic binge, I'd done 100mgs and it felt great but I didn't do the drug justice. This time I'm planning on snooting 80mgs on it's own without any psychedelic tolerance whatsoever I'm talking not doing anything for a month. Will that be enuff for a full on heavy duty trip?


Then I was gonna try taking the remaining 40mgs intranasal while simultaneously dropping 15mgs of 4-AcO-DMT orally at the same time. By doing this I'm hoping to drag out the DPT trip for hours and have it change into the Psilacetin headspace. I'm hoping for both of these to be rewarding spiritual experiences. What are your thoughts on these plans my friends?

80mg of DPT intranasal should be a pretty good trip. I usually like it in the 75-90mg range but have tripped on as little as 50mg intranasal.


40mg is enough to trip too, but it will obviously be a milder effect. It should combo really well with the psilacetin. I would snort that too if it were me.


How do you feel about it being communion? I mean do you believe DPT is the body and blood of the Lord like The temple of true inner light?


Catholics believe that if you consume the eucharist without confession Christ's body will pay the penalty of your sins directly causing you to have sinned against the body of the Lord by causing his body to take your punishment directly. Does this happen if you consume DPT without first making an examination of your conscience and confessing your sins?


I don't think most people who do DPT really think about the implications of consuming the Temple's communion, but I know that I have and that I did so willingly and without guidance or permission from the temple.


The church I attend invites all baptized believers to participate in communion, not just members of a certain denomination.  I hope the Temple feels the same way.


Perhaps the DPT must be blessed first or something. Like Catholics don't believe all wine is the eucharist,  only the wine transformed during mass becomes the blood of Christ.


So perhaps DPT obtained away from the temple isn't necessarily considered communion until some form of mass is said over it?


I wonder what the Temple's stand on that is. I might ask them. I've emailed with them before.


I know that taking communion with them does not make you a member like it does in some Christian churches. According to their website only those who sell all their worldly possessions and work full time for the Temple are considered fully members.


I once did DPT for 24 hours straight. That's a longtime to be under the influence of a different church than I really belong to's communion. It's also a longtime to think about being one with the body of Christ.


It's something to consider. I mean you will be consuming something that some people believe to be the body of Christ.


Just knowing that has some kind of effect on how I feel about using DPT.


I was a junior parishioner in the Church of Neuroscience which proclaimed the molecular sacrament. Basically they taught that the research chemicals they sold were a form of communion, however I don't believe that it was Christian in any way or that they claimed any drugs were the body of Christ the way the temple does. They sold chemicals by the gram at church of neuroscience. The Temple does not sell drugs.


Are you just tripping on DPT or are you communing with the body of Christ? It's really something to think about when your tripping on DPT. Especially if you do some reading first about the eucharist and what the catholic church believes/teaches about the eucharist.


As someone who identifies as a Christian I want to be in communion with Christ. Unfortunately there are beliefs expressed in the Temple's literature that I find questionable and contrary to my own beliefs otherwise I would gladly join them! It's attractive to me as someone that identifies as Christian AND loves psychedelics.


I tripped at my church once! I took 25i-NBOH on my birthday in 2013 and then went to church with my wife and stepson. It was beautiful.


Anyway, [@Cosmic Charlie](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/98703/)  I hope you will think about communion when you trip. Really I hope everyone who does DPT at least considers that they are consuming a church's communion. That's pretty heavy actually when you get into eucharistic beliefs and teachings.


Sorry about this wall of text.


TL;DR-DPT is considered the literal body of Christ by some people and you are taking communion with them by knowingly consuming it.

I think anyone doing DPT should at least read some of the temple's literature. You are going to be consuming their eucharist.

Therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord unworthily will have to answer for the body and blood of the Lord. A person should examine himself, and so eat the bread and drink the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself." 1 Cor 11:24-29

Of course I haven't really gotten a chance to delve into what the core beliefs of the temple actually are yet myself. I'm trying to learn from them directly what it is that they believe.


I just got invited to their discord server.

From my perspective, you're consuming their eucharist *only if* you consume *as* their eucharist. It's not by default the Temple of Inner Light's eucharist any more than smoking weed is necessarily partaking in a holy Rastafarian sacrament, or drinking wine is automatically a Catholic sacrament. What I mean is that DPT isn't holy out of the box, to me it looks like it's neutral DPT and it needs to be wrapped in the culture/religion to become the eucharist. There is some magic in that process, sanctification. They may have something different to say about it, but that's how it looks to me as an outsider. 


 I respect and appreciate you bringing this religious context to the discussion!

Wow, I really had no clue what these temple people believed until they started telling me. Their website doesn't tell the half of it. 


I've had a very informative night on their discord server.

I will for what little I know. I had a friend visit the Church in the early 80's and he said they gave him DPT and then got preached in his face.  He said he would never do that again. And it may be different today than 40 years ago.  But that is all I got.  I am sure wisdom can be plucked from some of the teachings like any other spiritual congregation.


Psychedelics are sacraments open to anyone and any beliefs.  I respect the church but it is just another religion with wisdom as well as nonsense.


Has anyone IM'd DPT and insufflated it for a comparison?  Is IM worth it?  I don't mind insufflating it, it is an HCL so I feel like I offend my sinuses but it is not really bad.  And 15 minutes after insufflating I am rocketed.  But for sure looking into IM.

thanks for sharing, I'm about to put an order in for some of this and you're report feels encouraging. I'm thinking of trying it orally with in MAOI at some point. I once experienced the exorcism of an octopus from somewhere deep inside on ayahuasca

there are about a dozen reports on erowid of harmala dpt combos, it seems to potentiate it but I'm unsure, sometimes its difficult to gauge the intensity just by reading the reports and sensitivity varies from person to person anyway. Morninggloryseed has a report of mixing 240mg with harmalas which did not sound super intense given the dose, thanks for info about metabolism

I would be surprised if DPT is potentiated by an MAOI, as it appears that tryptamines with N,N-dialkyl chains longer than the methyl are metabolised through 6-hydroxylation, not amine oxidation. Either way, it is a worthwhile assay to do, to broaden the experiential characterisation of these compounds.

The synergy between DPT and Ketamine is insane. Took 20 mg insluflated and 10 minutes later injected 80 mg of ketamine into my deltoid. Had an extremely vivid and visual K-hole. I was funny how as the ketamine receded, around 40 minutes, DPT took a stronger hold of what was going on in my mind. There was a point where I opened my eyes mid-hole and could not discern what I was looking at, where I was, what I was. I felt completely transported to another real. If I must put a name on it, I would say it was the dimension of information. 


Most of the trip/hole revolved around the concept of "un-being", transcending being and becoming nothing, but it felt like such a paradox that for nothing to exists there must be something to define that nothingness by contrast, as exteriority. And that something seemed to be consciousness, it felt like as long as consciousness exists "nothing" can always be perceived as "something", and it felt like consciousness would go on existing forever, precisely because there will always be something to be perceived (I don't think this makes too much sense, but at the moment the object/subject duality seemed impossible to transcend so it felt like the existence of an object necessitated the existence of a subject). At moments it felt exasperating that existence would go on forever and ever, something inside me wanted the eternal rest of nothingness, something inside me wanted the struggle to end, but it seemed like an impossible wish. But at some point, it all turned around and I felt euphoric, I thought that maybe everything is repeating again and again and that makes the struggle eternal, but also makes the joys of existence ever returning, existing forever in time.


I don't know if it makes any sense, lol, but it felt very life affirming, and today I feel excited and hypomanic.

Had 20mg of DPT insufflated and it was just right for still being able to operate IRL - much more and I might have needed to lie on the floor. DPT has a really nice warm afterglow. Can't say this was a profound trip or anything, just a very enjoyable music-focused trip with everything turned up a couple notches. It's likely that I have some tolerance left over from 3 days of tripping last week, but I was conservative with dosages so maybe not that much. One thing I've noticed is that comeups seem to go smoother when you've been having some practice lately.


Before my trip I was paralyzed with trying to decide which psychedelic to take out of my collection. Sometimes it's overwhelming when you look at all the many baggie-options, trying to figure out the best intersection between the various choices, how many hours left in the day, what kind of ride you want etc. In the end I went with DPT because it was getting late and it's a nice short duration trip.

I admit perpetualdawn I saw you type that at the end of July and it peaked me.  I had been hammering on in the DPT thread that Early Aug is a ritual for me to have a DPT trip.  But I missed the last few years.  So last night I had 35 mgs.  Tooted all at once.  Came on hard and heavy the first hour.  Had to hold on a bit while sitting on my bed letting it do it's thing.  Then it smooths into an electrical charged mind trip.  Music jumps out in a way that it does not under other psychedelic.  Since I am an old dog (still trying to learn new tricks lol) I resorted to going to the archives and focusing in on 1968-1969 Grateful Dead.  Jerry with the Gibson. Phil bouncing that bass that peaked me a few times and made me say how did he do that and know what I was thinking. lol  For new music I sometimes come here to see what people are suggesting.  Don't want to be stuck in my ways but I grew up tripping listening to the Grateful Dead.  Went through a Jazz period of some years too.  Jazz is a trip without having to take a psychedelic.


There is a lot of energy to DPT.  I did lay on the bed most of the night but had to get up, go out on the deck.  Listen to the sounds of the second half of the summer. Heard a total rhythm to the cicadas and crickets.  I heard them talking in their way.  It is amazing how we listen to this nightly but tune it out.  After that more music and an insight that everything has a rhythm.  We look for rhythms, it is a reason we indulge in music.  And it occurred our minds look for that everywhere.  My deep insight for the night.  I did hit a few moments of YES!!  Taken to a climbed peak. About 3 times.  I am so use to tripping so I wonder if that is a peak experience.  I may have had so many in my life I can't tell anymore.  But at one of those peaks I could have burst into joy.


Not too visual except for some moments where they patterns flow into each other with some electricity.  But not a very visual drug at 35 mgs.  This was one of my better DPT trips.  A lot of light and morphing. I can see why the thread is titled so much light.  I saw that light infuse the energy.  When I went higher on DPT in the past I had total LSD like patterns. Lower amounts while still intense still had vibrations. The Salvia type effect was also there.  I had another insight.  Had a thought, something about Salvia and DPT bring out the tin soldiers, chess pieces, medieval flow to the patterns.  I can't really verbalize it.  But there is some connection between Salvia and DPT.  Some cross over effect I can not describe.


DPT is pretty stable I gather. I mean what could it break down into?  Had the same white powder for 11 years sealed in a jar.  Looks like the picture on Erowid.   And very glad I capped it at 35 mgs.  Amazing how a half hour after snorting everything gets taken apart and you have to hold on a bit and let it ride over you and accept.  After the first hour I realize I don't have to hold on as much.  It opens up more. Fades at the 3 hour point quickly.  Hour one is intense, hour two it breaks into smoother energy flows (and rhythm), hour 3 still up but then a  quick come down. Abrupt.


Simple tryptamines seem very stable.  I had smoked 6 year old DMT that was as potent as a newer batch.  DMT does not break down into much  I gather either.  I think these substance being simple just stay as they are.  I could be wrong but they are not the same as say mushrooms which for sure lose potency. I guess what I am saying is don't assume like some people had with LSD blotters that they "could be weaker" but then get their ass handed to them. lol


Drugs are strange.  Salvia seems to get stronger as it sits through the years.

If you look at this video at about the 18 minute mark you can see some data from a study that I think is still unreleased that apparently shows DPT as binding to the kappa-opioid receptor. The simplicity of base tryptamines I think lends them to a wide ray of potential receptor activities; [this study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073820304151) for example claims that DMT weakly hits the mu-opioid receptor.


That being said I find salvia and serotonergic psychedelics to have similarities in general too so maybe it could just be a functional selectivity thing for DPT where its 5-HT2A receptor activities just happen to be more salvia-like than other psychedelics too, but I felt it was worth mentioning.

I forget, is that the receptor that salvia works on?

[@JackARoe](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/121120/) sounds like a very nice trip. I always find DPT is such a great drug for enjoying music, and I can really relate to you tripping out to the sounds of the cicadas. Stuff like that always sounds magnificent and I find it causes a lot of the acoustic version of tracers - a lot of echoing, zipping, and flanging types of effects.

It sure is, although it should be stated that from the data I see there, it does not appear clear whether DPT would act as an agonist or an antagonist at this site. Salvinorin A acts as an agonist. DPT very well could too but I wouldn't just assume it.

A lot of people do say something like this too. I enjoyed DPT greatly, but I did find it to have somewhat spooky hallucinations (it fit the Halloween vibe of the time which is why I smoked it then in the first place) and I remember feeling it to be a little dissociating in a way I compared to nitrous oxide, which I also once upon a time referred to as "happy salvia".


There is a decent amount of scientific data showing pretty conclusively that DALT-derived tryptamines bind to kappa-opioid receptors as well, with specific affinity numbers and everything, such as can be seen [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6230509/). Other interesting relevant sites include mu-opioid receptors and dopamine transporters. DALT itself has the following affinities, among others:


5-HT1A Receptor: 100 nM

5-HT2A Receptor: 701 nM

Dopamine Transporter: 1,406 nM

Kappa-Opioid Receptor: 2,477 nM


While it still to my knowledge remains unclear whether these tryptamines behave as agonists or antagonists at the kappa-opioid receptor, at this point, I would say that if a scientific paper like the one referenced in the YouTube video linked above claims to have found that DPT binds to the kappa-opioid receptor, it's probably right.

Yes, I completely agree with the spooky nature of DPT. I've said it before, it's not like it makes me into a spooked-out person (although I probably am a little more wary than I might be on other psychedelics or sober), it's more like it makes me a participant in the spooky realms. As in it's not necessarily fear-inducing, more like it makes me in touch with spooky aspects of the world.


Can you think of a good "citizen-science" way to test if DPT is an agonist or antagonist to the kappa-opioid receptor? Maybe by carefully observing a combined dosage of salvia + DPT would reveal it .. but that also sounds like a recipe for trouble!

Exactly this. Funnily enough, I didn't find the experience itself to dysphoric. That's a misremembering. It was the days afterward where I felt the creepiness linger.

Had an amazing trip on DPT last night taking 60mgs in two divided doses. Went with 30mgs intranasal and then 90mins later redosed the same amount. The body high from it was incredibly euphoric and erotic, during the peak i felt this very sexy sorta push and i was watching porn and really going for it. 


The orgasms were so good, but i wished i just waited for my girl to be here so i could of actually fucked. The visuals werent that prominent but i did take 200ugs of LSD about four days ago so tolerance deff played a factor. The mental component of the trip was very healing and loving, didnt find any connection to the dark and spooky trips people speak of.


 Had no negative body load or the tremors i read about. All in all it was a blissful experience, and id like to explore it more someday with a higher intial dose. Maybe taking 55mgs at once with less tolerance in play. Two thumbs up for this stuff, a Damn Powerful Tryptamine indeed.

Haha it's weird, but this drug has a clearly erotic edge to me. The first time I took it I had some borderline pornographic CEVs, and the topic of "desire" was a constant through the trip, seen from various different angles and interpretations.

Sorry for the slow response, I remember being kind of distracted at the time and then I ended up getting sick twice over the last couple months, it sucked and I kind of lost track of things.


I don't actually have any DPT anymore myself so I couldn't participate in such an experiment, but if I did, I think the way I would actually try to figure it out would most likely just be using salvia and DPT frequently in close proximity back and forth, until I could determine whether or not DPT seemed to do anything that salvia did with a high amount of certainty that isn't something I typically notice in other psychedelics. It may not be a perfect experiment, but I'm not sure it's really easy for the average person to come across the kind of kappa-opioid receptor ligands that would really allow for more precise and specific testing than that.... They're not very common from what I can tell, either agonists or antagonists, particularly selective ones.


The thing about salvia for me is that while I do actually find it to have a remarkable number of similarities to serotonergic psychedelics, there are certain things about it that still stand out to me as basically only being produced by it.... I feel like if I experienced the salvia state and the state of DPT back and forth over and over close enough together, I'd be able to tell you with a high amount of confidence whether or not the same things were happening. I know it's not perfect but it's the best I'd probably actually be able to do. Perhaps one day I will if I ever get another chance.


For actual scientific certainty, I think it will likely just take a scientific study specifically testing it. I think they might get there eventually.... I bet this is the kind of information psychedelic scientists would actually be pretty interested to discover and look into if they did. I could see it playing a lot into the conversation of the current psychedelic revolution and discussion about if and how these different molecules can be used therapeutically.


I'll let you know if I think of any other ideas too though, it might be a little easier once I'm finally completely not sick again (still have a cold a little bit).

[@perpetualdawn](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/307995/)


Welp, I found one.


It’s called amentoflavone. According to Wikipedia, “Amentoflavone has a variety of in vitro activities including antimalarial activity, anticancer activity (which may, at least in part, be mediated by its inhibition of fatty acid synthase), and antagonist activity at the κ-opioid receptor (Ke = 490 nmol L−1) as well as activity at the allosteric benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor as a negative allosteric modulator.”


Amentoflavone is a natural component of multiple herbs including St. John’s wort and ginkgo biloba. According to the [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2265593/) that Wikipedia links to as a citation, “We have shown that amentoflavone (4) and hyperoside (6), flavonoids present in H. perforatum, have κ antagonist activity in vitro. In addition, preliminary SAR investigations have identified that the stereochemistry of the C2 and C3 positions is important for antagonist activity and selectivity. Further exploration of these findings is underway and will be reported in due course.”


Flavones and their derivatives are popular and relatively well-studied at this point. It’s not uncommon to actually find them being sold pure (or close enough) in supplement form. In fact, [here’s an amentoflavone supplement being sold at Walmart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/SNS-Amentoflavone-XT-60-Capsules/2487686582?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=17596&adid=222222222282487686582_17596_14069003552_202077872&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=m&wl3=42423897272&wl4=pla-295289030566&wl5=9030773&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=120820241&wl11=online&wl12=2487686582_17596&veh=sem&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADmfBIrx02K_BTygRuKAftpHJfH0z&gclid=CjwKCAjw15eqBhBZEiwAbDomEiInYTDn5uKRV0KgWnF6ZaTQy-Nlnsj-AdQCd2qnUPhOVU-u0vBuMxoCrcgQAvD_BwE).


I also found an old [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/c5vkb9/comment/esqnu8r/) by a user who claimed to enjoy taking 200 mg of amentoflavone while working out. They claim to get an “anti-dysphoric” effect and are of the opinion that the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist is involved, but it should be noted that, as that post goes into, it is not entirely clean and selective in this mechanism of action. I haven’t looked into it enough to know why they were taking it while working out, but I feel it should be noted that many flavones and their derivatives can actually have steroidal effects, via mechanisms such as being agonists or antagonists at androgen, estrogen, and progesterone receptors, or even aromatase inhibition (a mechanism sought by users of synthetic steroids, which prevents metabolism of testosterone into estradiol, the primary estrogen). Personally, I do not recommend using flavones willy-nilly, at least not on a chronic basis, but taking one a few times for an experiment like this probably wouldn’t do any non-negligible damage.


The question that remains is still how active of a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist it actually is? If I was to run an experiment on amentoflavone, salvia, and DPT, I would do it in the following steps:


1. Take a full dose of amentoflavone and then try smoking salvia. If salvia still works exactly the same way, repeat this step with increasing dosages of amentoflavone until a tolerable limit is reached. If salvia still feels the same, the experiment is over. If the salvia trip is actually noticeably inhibited, progress to step 2.


2. Take the same dosage of amentoflavone that was successful in step 1 and then try using a psychedelic that is not suspected to have kappa-opioid receptor agonist activity, or more specifically is relatively likely not to. Document the changes in effect, if any, very carefully. The fact that amentoflavone is also a negative allosteric modulator of GABA(A) receptors means that it might potentiate psychedelics in the opposite way of how things like benzodiazepines suppress them. It is also possible that some unappreciated part of the downstream effects of 5-HT2A receptor agonist involves dynorphin release and that the effects of even a selective psychedelic would be altered by a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. Of course, it’s also important to know if any potential off-target effects, like steroidal effects or whatever, will alter the trip. If the trip seems relatively unchanged or like the differences are easily accounted for, progress to step 3.


3. Take the same dosage of amentoflavone and try using DPT. If the DPT trip is relatively unaffected or affected in the same way as the psychedelic from step 2, I would consider that evidence that there is no kappa-opioid receptor agonist component to the DPT trip. If the DPT trip is more significantly inhibited than the psychedelic from step 2 and in a way more similar to salvia, I would consider that evidence that there might actually be a kappa-opioid receptor agonist component to the DPT trip - although, it would still be unclear if the effect is direct, like salvia, or resulting from DPT causing more dynorphin release downstream than other psychedelics, or something like that. And again this would all just be evidence either way, not proof, but still, evidence.


I do not recommend trying this if the combination of amentoflavone and the psychedelic from step 2 makes you physically uncomfortable. GABA(A) receptor negative allosteric modulation should lower the seizure threshold for the same reason that positive allosteric modulation raises it, and DPT has rarely been associated with seizures before. Don’t push yourself if the amentoflavone seems to potentiate the psychedelics in an uncomfortable way.


So that would be the best plan I think I can come up with so far. I’d consider trying it myself if I still had some DPT, but again I sadly do not. But I’ll leave it here at least for you and others to consider.

Great post [@Kaleida](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/377522/) and what a find! I love this experiment plan, it makes a lot of sense to me and that's the way I'd go about it too. I can't see myself actually taking it on unfortunately because it would be too many trips for me to be able to pull off right now considering my life situation, and also no access to Salvia that I'm aware of. But your post is gold and I hope someone chances upon it and takes it up safely and carefully. This is very very interesting stuff.


Side note: I remember taking ginkgo extract a few times in my university days and it giving me a splitting headache. Not sure what all the active molecules are in there, or if amentoflavone was the cause, but that would be something I'd personally have to test in a step #0.

I've been debating whether or not I might try the amentoflavone + salvia part of it myself at least. I might give it a shot since I've been toying around with mixing things with salvia plain leaf to see what effect it has anyway. I've mostly just been unsure of it I want to try bothering with the flavonoid supplement right now, but I think I'll look into it. Not right away, but maybe not too far in the future. I do think it's an interesting experiment, and it could be kind of neat to have a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist on tap, if it turns out to seem like a truly significant one.

I think ginkgo biloba has a lot of potential active substances in it. I just looked it up on Wikipedia and it says: "Extracts of ginkgo leaves contain phenolic acids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, such as myricetin, kaempferol, isorhamnetin, and quercetin, and the terpene trilactones ginkgolides and bilobalides. The leaves also contain unique ginkgo biflavones, alkylphenols, and polyprenols." So, it could definitely be a lot of things seemingly that could have contributed to your headache.


For reference, a couple of those like kaempferol and quercetin which I'd think might be slightly more likely that you might've heard of are in the same family of molecules as amentoflavone, except that amentoflavone is kind of like two of those kinds of molecules squashed together. For example:


Amentoflavone


![220px-Amentoflavone.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F5%2F5f%2FAmentoflavone.svg%2F220px-Amentoflavone.svg.png&hash=a40cc43214e2ca2756ce0f7f13b60452)


Quercetin


![250px-Quercetin.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F8%2F81%2FQuercetin.svg%2F250px-Quercetin.svg.png&hash=d56660c1fd3c4f26e240b49f02c2e702)


So, if you've ever tried any of those supplements, it's possible that it will have a similar effect, but also possibly distinct too. I don't know if you do know anything about those kinds of flavonoids or not, I just wanted to point out them as an example in case they might help, as some of them are more commonly known about by people, since like I said they're common enough supplements that they're even sold in places like Walmart.


I definitely understand wanting to "allergy test" first as they say. I wouldn't push into something uncomfortable for the sake of an experiment like this, it might even be considerable as a confounding factor, but I do think it'd be a fun experiment to try if there aren't any problems like that.

It looks like Kaempherol is really close to Quercetin. And to my surprise, Kaempherol seems to have nothing in common chemically with [Camphor Oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphor)

This is getting a bit off topic, but I can't resist: just chanced on this paper: 


##### Inhibition of ALDH2 by quercetin glucuronide suggests a new hypothesis to explain red wine headaches​
Quercetin is one of the components of Ginko extract that we were just talking about, and this is interesting because of the Ginkgo headaches I was mentioning.


"Some alcohol consumers exhibit flushing and experience headaches, and this is attributed to a dysfunctional ALDH2 variant, the enzyme that metabolizes acetaldehyde, allowing it to accumulate" 


So from what I understand, ALDH2 is an enzyme that breaks down acetaldehyde, an acetaldehyde is a nasty metabolize of ethanol that causes headaches and discomfort.


"quercetin-3-glucuronide, a typical circulating quercetin metabolite, inhibits ALDH2"


So it's possible that Ginkgo extract has enough quercetin in it to inhibit ALDH2. However, I was getting Ginkgo headaches without drinking ethanol (aside from the ethanol in the extract - which is hard to imagine would be enough?) so it doesn't quite all add up.

And will do! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Yeah, there's a lot of chemicals known that are in that family or close to it. Another one that looks different enough that you might not immediately make the connection but which you may have heard about anyway is resveratrol.


![250px-Resveratrol.svg.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fthumb%2F1%2F17%2FResveratrol.svg%2F250px-Resveratrol.svg.png&hash=ea4830b97a5e87a4e818f4127dd1d275)


Ironically, when you first made your most recent post here I was already thinking about pointing out the fact that resveratrol is a component of red wine, heh. Great minds think alike I suppose.

This is news to me but apparently resveratrol modulates this enzyme too. I wonder if this is common among these molecules.


The side effects from improper metabolism of ethanol by ALDH2 are no joke. Common wisdom apparently claims that these kinds of side effects are more common in people of Asian descent and one of my favorite YouTubers who is half Asian once had a heart attack from having just a few beers because he gets this so badly. I don't consider myself an expert but apparently this is the specific problem linked to the dysfunctional ALDH2 variant you mentioned, or that's what science seems to think currently anyway.


I don't actually know enough to really confidently make any claims about whether or not the effects of quercetin on ALDH2 could cause this alone, but it is an interesting find. For what it's worth, ethanol and acetaldehyde are both endogenous substances in the human body. There's actually a rare physical disorder called [auto-brewery syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome) where someone's body produces far too much endogenous ethanol and they are simply intoxicated from it at all times to the point that they may even fail a drunk driving test. All drug humor jokes that could arise from that aside, it sounds like a miserable condition to have.


I'm afraid I can't really answer whether I think that might be the link to why you get headaches from Ginkgo biloba, but I do find it interesting and would be curious to hear more if you find more possible links (although perhaps the conversation should be taken elsewhere). It's been a long time since I looked into flavonoids really other than when I was looking up amentoflavone but I might have to look into them more in general again because they do seem pharmacologically very interesting.

I had the most intense and terrifying trip of my life.


Dose: 150 mg of moclobemide (MAOI) and 150 mg of DPT insufflated an hour later. Let this be a warning to you that this substance is no joke.


Given the amount of powder and my sensitive nose, I didn't have much trouble snorting that much, which was a big plus. Unfortunately, my nose was clogged for a good few hours afterwards, long after the trip was over. This also influenced my later hallucinations.


The first effects appeared after 5 minutes and there was no sign of impending disaster. I got up from the computer, texted my friends that I was going to lie down and listen to music, and so I did. I was lying there, watching increasingly vivid visuals, but at some point, I started feeling extremely suffocated and that something was wrong. I felt like I was about to have a heart attack and couldn't get enough oxygen. I decided to get up from bed and go to the balcony for some fresh air. This is where the real horror began, and I don't fully remember what happened after that.


I wandered around the apartment, panicking that I was suffocating. I stripped naked, I don't know why… Maybe I thought it would help. I desperately wanted to free myself from that feeling and felt trapped in my own body. I think I was walking around, screaming and begging for help, or maybe even for death. I just wanted it to be over.

Another flash of memory – deciding to take some benzos. I went to my medicine drawer and stood there frozen because I didn't know what to do. I knew I needed to take benzos, but I didn't know what a drawer was, what benzos were, hands, nothing... complete disorientation. Somehow, I managed to figure out how to open the drawer and which package contained the benzos, and I took exactly 4 mg of eszopiclone.

I don't remember what happened next, but I think I went to bed to wait it out. The next thing I remember is feeling an imminent puke coming without warning. Thankfully, I instinctively stuck my head out of bed, so I didn't throw up all over it. I assume I must have gotten up and run to the bathroom, vomiting everywhere along the way. Imagine having an ego-death trip and suddenly you have to puke. It was a nightmare. Typically, I convinced myself that I was vomiting my insides, and when I looked in the mirror, I saw blood pouring out of every hole in my face. I especially felt like blood was flowing from my nose, caused by the unpleasant feeling of a clogged nose from the nasal intake. I was completely sure it was the end, my body had given up, and I was dying. I wanted to call an ambulance, but luckily, the trip was so intense that making a phone call was too complicated for me. Then I somehow convinced myself that I had called an ambulance, and they were on their way. I thought, "Well, the day had to come eventually. I've been using drugs so much that I finally overdid it." Later, I saw myself in a hospital, doctors examining me, etc. – but in reality, it was just hallucinations.


If I had been tripping with someone, I would probably have begged them to call an ambulance. But when the benzos started to kick in and the need to vomit passed, I lay down in bed and watched the visuals. Despite taking benzos, I was still having a powerful trip on a verge of losing consciousness.

My visions were beautiful – I saw abstract scenes that carried the following message: All elements of human society are interdependent and form cycles, and this pattern has existed for thousands of years. DPT showed me a convincing evidence that everything people do today has its analog in something people did 50,000 years ago. The visions also convinced me that we ourselves are a part of God. The visions looped. It was like the vision would start with the thesis "Man needs art, so..." and end with "...so art needs man."  - with a lot of other conclusions in between and it all made the perfect sense and was mind blowing. It was a mental loop that I couldn't escape. It's hard to describe in words because it was something beyond the understanding of a sober person. Anyway, the message conveyed by these visions was very convincing, incredible, and beautiful.
