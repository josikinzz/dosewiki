## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as 1,4-benzodiazepines. These are organic compounds containing a benzene ring fused to a 1,4-azepine.

### Background

Lormatazepam is an orally available benzodiazepine used in the UK for the treatment of short-term insomnia
2
. It is marketed by Auden Mckenzie (Pharma Division) in 0.5 and 1 mg tablet formulations.

### Indication

For the treatment of short-term insomnia
2

### Pharmacodynamics

Lormetazepam is a benzodiazepine which reduces central nervous system (CNS) activity
2
,
1
. It produces anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, sedative and hypnotic effects. Because it is a short-acting benzodiapine, it does not produce significant sedation after waking.

### Mechanism of Action

GABA(A) Receptor
Positive allosteric modulator
GABA(A) Receptor Benzodiazepine Binding Site
Ligand

### Metabolism

Metabolised to an inactive metabolite via glucuronide conjugation

2
.

### Toxicity

The primary manifestation of overdosage ranges from drowsiness to coma and symptoms may include ataxia, hypotension, hypotonia, respiratory depression which may lead to death
2
.
Experimental LD50 values are as follows
3
: Mouse - 780 mg/kg (intraperitoneal), 1790 mg/kg (oral), 10000 mg/kg (subcutaneous). Rat - 6250 mg/kg (intraperitoneal), 10000 mg/kg (oral), 10000 mg/kg (intraperitoneal).

### Mechanism of action

Lormetazepam, as a benzodiazepine, binds to the regulatory site between the α and γ subunits of γ-aminobutryic acid (GABA) A receptors with γ2 and α1, α2, α3, or α5 subunits
1
. This facilitates the opening of the chloride channel allowing chloride ions to flow into the neuron resulting in hyperpolarization. Hyperpolarized neurons require greater simulation to reach their action potential threshold. The general inhibitory effect on neuronal depolarization produces the effects of lormetazepam.

### Curator comments

Benzodiazepines modulate GABA(A) function by binding at the interface between alpha (α) and gamma (γ) subunits. Of the 6 α-subunits, only 4 (α-1, -2, -3, and -5) participate in the formation of this binding site. The above target is a collection of all α- and γ-subunits that are known to participate in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site.

### General Function

Alpha subunit of the heteropentameric ligand-gated chloride channel gated by Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain (PubMed:23909897, PubMed:25489750, PubMed:29950725, PubMed:30602789). GABA-gated chloride channels, also named GABA(A) receptors (GABAAR), consist of five subunits arranged around a central pore and contain GABA active binding site(s) located at the alpha and beta subunit interface(s) (PubMed:29950725, PubMed:30602789). When activated by GABA, GABAARs selectively allow the flow of chloride anions across the cell membrane down their electrochemical gradient (PubMed:23909897, PubMed:29950725, PubMed:30602789). Alpha-1/GABRA1-containing GABAARs are largely synaptic (By similarity). Chloride influx into the postsynaptic neuron following GABAAR opening decreases the neuron ability to generate a new action potential, thereby reducing nerve transmission (By similarity). GABAARs containing alpha-1 and beta-2 or -3 subunits exhibit synaptogenic activity; the gamma-2 subunit being necessary but not sufficient to induce rapid synaptic contacts formation (PubMed:23909897, PubMed:25489750). GABAARs function also as histamine receptor where histamine binds at the interface of two neighboring beta subunits and potentiates GABA response (By similarity). GABAARs containing alpha, beta and epsilon subunits also permit spontaneous chloride channel activity while preserving the structural information required for GABA-gated openings (By similarity). Alpha-1-mediated plasticity in the orbitofrontal cortex regulates context-dependent action selection (By similarity). Together with rho subunits, may also control neuronal and glial GABAergic transmission in the cerebellum (By similarity)
