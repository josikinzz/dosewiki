## Subjective Experience

Whilst MDA was first synthesized in 1910, and was subsequently tested and used for
various medicinal purposes, it didn’t emerge as a recreational drug until the 1960's.
Its effects are often compared to those of MDMA, although there appears to be a
number of significant differences, not least its apparent variability, a greater
stimulation and a stronger psychedelic edge.

It is currently a Schedule 1 controlled drug in the US and a Class A drug in the UK.

Regarding dose, MDA is often cited as requiring about half as much as MDMA to
approximate the same level of effect. Listed in PiHKAL (#100), Shulgin referred to a
dosage of 80-160mg, whilst across Internet forums a decent dose is sometimes
claimed to be 1mg per kg (about 75mg for the average man). This is broadly what I
will be pitching at.

Note that at time of testing I have become particularly cautious with drugs in this
class due to hangovers following a couple of recent experiments. Internet references
to neurotoxicity, with some citing MDA specifically, have further tempered my
enthusiasm for a more substantial foray.

\`\`\`
T+0:00 I measure 80mg and bomb it in folded rizla paper. [4.00pm]
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:30 A mild headiness is developing along with a slight tingling of the skin,
which is enveloped within an increasing general comfort. This is coming on
quickly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
My pupils are already partly dilated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+0:40 I am now high. There is a very strong cognitively immersed euphoric
feel to this, and a strong empathogenic drive. Horn is also clearly available.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am heating up quickly, so I am keeping well topped up with water, even at
this early stage.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I already know that 80mg was a plentiful dose and wonder with a little
trepidation how much further this will go.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:10 This is a heady, sweaty, serene-like experience, with a sex drive and a
trippy edge. I am probably in the upper ++ Shulgin range at the moment,
hovering towards +++.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I can just about interact sensibly, but would fail with any complex or serious
social challenge, at least in terms of hiding my condition.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
It is a pleasant enough roll, but with a little anxiety surfacing now and again
on the basis that it could go higher and beyond my ability to manage it.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:20 For the first time I feel that I may be getting on top of this: possibly.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I am rather hot and clammy, my mind is high with a strong drifty aura, and I
feel very empathetic. There is a touch of psychedelia lurking there too, which
impacts upon clarity.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+1:40 I am now in more control of the experience, which remains strong.
Whilst the general warmth is a heavy physical feature, there are occasional
shivers. I know in these cold snaps that it would be a mistake to add clothing
as my temperature is clearly elevated.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
The empathetic quality of the high is still a dominant factor, with a strong urge
for intimacy. It is glaringly obvious why its sister, MDMA, is sometimes
referred to as the love drug. I should stress though that in most respects MDA
does seem to be more cognitively embracing than MDMA.
\`\`\`

\`\`\`
I am in the middle of ++ territory, as it ebbs and flows.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:00 Although I am still in command of my mindset, I am warmer than
ever: I am actually sweating. I don’t feel uncomfortable with this, with the
buzzing high carrying me along. However, I can absolutely understand how
people become dehydrated, and indeed over-hydrated, as measuring the
appropriate intake of fluid is not a trivial task. I sip sensibly rather than
gulping heavily.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+2:45 I am very much rolling, and perhaps still in the midst of a ++. The
headspace remains in situ as a nice rounded high, and I am still hot and still
drinking fluid. Drinking alcohol with this would clearly be reckless and
dangerous.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
I do feel jaw tension and the urge to gurn, but I am able to resist.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+3:10 I manage to eat a full meal without too much difficulty. It was very
slow going but there were no issues, and taste was fine.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+4:00 I have moved down a gear or so, but I am still drifting along.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
T+6:00 I am now floating down towards base. However, a sudden unexpected
visit from a neighbour demonstrates that I am still, in fact, quite heavily
influenced.
\`\`\`
\`\`\`
During the next few hours I edge towards normality but still sustain a drifting
headspace as I retire to bed at midnight (T+ 8 hours).
\`\`\`
The night’s sleep wasn’t too bad, with only a couple of disturbances, largely caused by
the volume of water I drank.

In the morning my head was slightly heavy, and I was still a little warm. My pupils
were also partly dilated, particularly the left. Presumably this all indicates that the
MDA hangs around in the system for quite a while. The accompanying tiredness and
mental fatigue eased during the day.

Perhaps also noteworthy is that a couple of nights later I had an extremely vivid
dream, the nature of which indicated that this intake of MDA may have been related,
particularly with respect to the stimulation of those receptors associated with
hallucinogenic effects.

Make no mistake about it, this was a strong roll. 80mg came on fast and whisked me
away with a head and body high that took me to the edge. Had I taken what is
purported to be a strong dose I have little doubt that I would have careered off the
path.

Caution should be exercised both with dose and frequency of use.

DESCRIPTION #
 
MDA's effects are very similar to the effects of MDMA. See also [MDMA Effects](https://erowid.org/../mdma/mdma_effects.shtml) . 
 
 Note: Erowid previously reported the duration of MDA to be "8-12 hours" based on the [entry in PIHKAL](https://erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal100.shtml) which appears to be wrong. After checking with a variety of sources, the consistent opinion is that MDA lasts just slightly longer than MDMA, but is otherwise very equivalent in duration. Many users report it has a longer, more stimulated after-effects period but others do not find this. If you have comments about experiences with known pure MDA or know of other verifiable resources, please [let us know](mailto:submissions%40erowid.org) . 
 
 We do have a couple reports of idiosyncratic reactions where users had effects for 12-18 hours after ingestion, but there are equivalent reports for MDMA. In research published in 2010, [Baggott, Siegrist et al.](https://erowid.org/references/8117/) , gave twelve subjects MDA (1.4mg/kg, around 100mg (and placebo during a different session) and administered a series of tests to assess effects. For five of the twelve participants, the MDA high lasted a total of about six hours, but in several of the participants, the effects were still quite strong at 6-8 hours. The ["MDA Effects Curve" duration graph](https://erowid.org/chemicals/show_image.php?i=mda/mda_duration_chart_large.png) (data from that study) shows effects still clearly off baseline at 8 hours after dosing. It is unknown why some people would stay high much longer than others, but it could be based on individual metabolism. 
 
 
L's Comparison of MDA to MDMA: 
 The total experience is 8 hours, but the 'trip' is 4-5 hours like X. The after-effects are like being way-laid, definitely washing around in the after-swell of a full experience of an amphetamine-hallucinogen. We call MDA 'industrial electronic mushrooms' and compare the post-peak to riding the diesel-electric locomotive all the way home. Your feet vibrate for some time after you step off a huge machine like that: tingling and numb. There's no finer intoxicant, but you need careful and considerable support or the body load can turn you into a vegetable for the latter half of the experience and the day after. With X you feel all the emotional and spiritual connectivy possible (much the 'empathogen'), with MDA you see (hallucinate, visually experience) all the emotional and spiritual connectivity possible.
 
 
Gracie & Zarkov's Comparison of MDA to MDMA: 
 "The differences from MDM(A) are striking: MDA is more hallucinogenic with noticeable closed eye imagery, is a much greater aesthetic enhancer, especially of people and of music; is more euphoric; more "drug-like", a heavier and more obviously body-involved trip. Tactile sensation is more powerful, erotic and noticeable on MDA. Physical effects are more up-front: gastric upset, pupil dilation, water retention, limbic arousal. On the whole, we find MDA a more enjoyable and interesting trip; longer lasting and more sexual/sensual. Our favorite characteristic is that one retains an interesting psychedelic ideation on MDA, rather then the feeling-oriented, but rather idealess thinking of MDM(A).

MDA Dosage
 
by Erowid
 
---
 
 
MDA generally comes in either tablet form or as a whitish powder. It is somewhat frequently found in pills sold as MDMA. Likewise, material sold as MDA is somewhat frequently actually MDMA. Following are approximate dosages in mg. Some people are more sensitive to MDA than others. Be careful if you are using MDA for the first time or using material of an unknown purity and strength. There is some disagreement about whether MDA is more potent than MDMA (requiring lower doses), or if they are similarly potent. This is complicated by the fact that most people are not using lab verified materials. Erowid's current view is that the required dose of MDA vs MDMA are very similar, but result in slightly different effects (MDA is more physically stimulating while MDMA is more empathogenic at the same dose).
 
- Oral MDA Dosages: Oral MDA Dosages

*PiHKAL Entry #100*


## SYNTHESIS
A suspension of 20 g LAH in 250 mL anhydrous THF was placed under an inert atmosphere and stirred magnetically. There was added, dropwise, 18 g of 1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-nitropropene in solution in THF and the reaction mixture was maintained at reflux for 36 h. After being brought back to room temperature, the excess hydride was destroyed with 15 mL IPA, followed by 15 mL of 15% NaOH. An additional 50 mL H2O was added to complete the conversion of the aluminum salts to a loose, white, easily filtered solid. This was removed by filtration, and the filter cake washed with additional THF. The combined filtrate and washes were stripped of solvent under vacuum, and the residue dissolved in dilute H2SO4. Washing with 3Ã75 mL CH2Cl2 removed much of the color, and the aqueous phase was made basic and reextracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. Removal of the solvent yielded 13.0 g of a yellow-colored oil that was distilled. The fraction boiling at 80â90 Â°C at 0.2 mm weighed 10.2 g and was water-white. It was dissolved in 60 mL of IPA, neutralization with concentrated HCl, and diluted with 120 mL of anhydrous Et2O which produced a lasting turbidity. Crystals formed spontaneously which were removed by filtration, washed with Et2O, and air dried to provide 10.4 g of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine hydrochloride (MDA) with a mp of 187â188 Â°C.

(from 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone) To a solution of 32.5 g anhydrous ammonium acetate in 120 mL MeOH, there was added 7.12 g 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylacetone (see under MDMA for its preparation) followed by 2.0 g sodium cyanoborohydride. The resulting yellow solution was vigorously stirred, and concentrated HCl was added periodically to keep the pH of the reaction mixture between 6 and 7 as determined by external damp universal pH paper. After several days, undissolved solids remained in the reaction mixture and no more acid was required. The reaction mixture was added to 600 mL of dilute HCl, and this was washed with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2. The combined washes were back-extracted with a small amount of dilute HCl, the aqueous phases combined, and made basic with 25% NaOH. This was then extracted with 3Ã100 mL CH2Cl2, these extracts combined, and the solvent removed under vacuum to provide 3.8 g of a red-colored residue. This was distilled at 80â90 Â°C at 0.2 mm/Hg to provide 2.2 g of an absolutely water-white oil. There was no obvious formation of a carbonate salt when exposed to air. This was dissolved in 15 mL IPA, neutralized with 25 drops of concentrated HCl, and diluted with 30 mL anhydrous Et2O. Slowly there was the deposition of white crystals of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine hydrochloride (MDA) which weighed 2.2 g and had a mp of 187â188 Â°C. The preparation of the formamide (a precursor to MDMA) and the acetamide (a precursor to MDE) are described under those entries.


## DOSAGE

## DURATION

## QUALITATIVE COMMENTS
(with 128 mg) âForty-five minutes after the second dosage, when I was seated in a room by myself, not smoking, and where there was no possible source of smoke rings, an abundance of curling gray smoke rings was readily observed in the environment whenever a relaxed approach to subjective observation was used. Visually these had complete reality and it seemed quite unneccessary to test their properties because it was surely known and fully appreciated that the source of the visual phenomena could not be external to the body. When I concentrated my attention on the details of the curling gray forms by trying to note how they would be affected by passing a finger through their apparent field, they melted away. Then, when I relaxed again, the smoke rings were there. I was as certain that they were really there as I am now sure that my head is on top of my body.â

(with 140 mg) âI vomited quite abruptly, and then everything was OK. I had been drinking probably excessively the last two days, and maybe the body needed to unpoison itself. The tactile sense is beautiful, but there seems to be some numbness as well, and I feel that nothing erotic would be do-able. Intimacy, yes, but no performance Iâm pretty sure. I saw the experience start drifting away only four hours into it, and I was sad to see it go. It was an all around delightful day.â

(with 200 mg, 2Ã100 mg spaced 1 h) âThe first portion was apparent at one-half hour. There was microscopic nausea shortly after the second portion was taken, and in an hour there was a complete +++ developed. The relaxation was extreme. And there seemed to be time distortion, in that time seemed to pass slowly. There was a occasional LSD-like moment of profoundness, but by and large it was a simple intoxication with most things seeming quite hilarious. The intoxication was also quite extreme. Some food was tried later in the experiment, and it tasted good, but there was absolutely no appetite. None at all.â

(with 60 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThere was a light and not too gentle development of a somewhat brittle wound-up state, a + or even a ++. Chills, and I had to get under an electric blanket to be comfortable. The effects smoothed out at the fourth hour, when things started to return to baseline. Not too entertaining.â

(with 100 mg of the âRâ isomer) âRapid development from the 40 minute point to an hour and a quarter; largely a pleasant intoxication, but there is something serious there too. No great insights, and not too much interference with the dayâs goings-on. Completely clear at the 8 hour point.â

(with 120 mg of the âRâ isomer) âThis is a stoning intoxicant. I would not choose to drive, because of possible judgement problems, but my handwriting seems to be clear and normal. The mental excitement dropped rapidly but I was aware of physical residues for several additional hours.â

(with 80 mg of the âSâ isomer) âA very thin, light threshold, which is quite delightful. I am quite willing to push this a bit higher.â

(with 120 mg of the âSâ isomer) âPerhaps to a one +. Very light, and very much like MDMA, but perhaps shorter lived. I am pretty much baseline in three hours.â

(with 160 mg of the âSâ isomer) âThe development is very rapid, and there is both muscular tremor and some nausea. The physicals are quite bothersome. With eyes closed, there are no effects noticeable, but with eyes open, things are quite bright and sparkling. The muscular spasms persist, and there is considerable teeth clenching. I feel that the mental is not worth the physical.â


## EXTENSIONS AND COMMENTARY
There is a broad and checkered history concerning the use and abuse of MDA, and it is not the case that all the use was medical and all the abuse was social. One of the compulsive drives of both the military and the intelligence groups, just after World War II, was to discover and develop chemical agents which might serve as âtruth serumsâ or as incapacitating agents. These government agencies considered the area of the psychedelics to be a fertile field for searching. The giving of relatively unexplored drugs in a cavalier manner to knowing and unknowing subjects was commonplace. There was one case in 1953, involving MDA and a psychiatric patient named Howard Blauer that proved fatal. The army had contracted with several physicians at the New York State Psychiatric Institute to explore new chemicals from the Edgewood Arsenal and one of these, with a chemical warfare code number of EA-1298, was MDA. The last and lethal injection into Blauer was an intravenous dose of 500 milligrams.

There have been a number of medical explorations. Under the code SKF-5 (and trade name of Amphedoxamine) it was explored as an anorexic agent. It has been found promising in the treatment of psychoneurotic depression. There are several medical reports, and one book (Claudio Naranjoâs The Healing Journey), that describe its values in psychotherapy.

MDA was also one of the major drugs that was being popularly used in the late 1960âs when the psychedelic concept exploded on the public scene. MDA was called the âhug-drugâ and was said to stand for Mellow Drug of America. There was no difficulty in obtaining unending quantities of it, as it was available as a research chemical from several scientific supply houses (as were mescaline and LSD) and was sold inexpensively under its chemical name.

A few experimental trials with the pure optical isomers show a consistency with all the other psychedelic compounds that have been studied in their separated forms, the higher potency with the âRâ isomer. The less potent âSâ isomer seemed to be more peaceful and MDMA-like at lower doses, but there were worrisome toxic signs at higher levels.

The structure of MDA can be viewed as an aromatic ring (the 3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl ring) with a three carbon chain sticking out from it. The amine group is on the second of the three carbon atoms. The isomers, with the amine function moved to the first of these carbons atoms (a benzylamine) and with the amine function moved to the third (furthest out atom) of these carbon atoms (a n-propylamine), are known and both have been assayed.

The benzylamine counterpart (as if one were to move the amine function from the beta-carbon to the alpha-carbon of the three carbon chain of the amphetamine molecule) is Î±-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine or 1-amino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propane, ALPHA. The hydrochloride salt has a mp of 199â201 Â°C. At low threshold levels (10 milligram area) there were eyes-closed âdreamsâ with some body tingling. The compound was not anorexic at any dose (up to 140 milligrams) and was reported to produce a pleasant, positive feeling. It is very short-lived (about 3 hours). The N-methyl homologue is Î±-ethyl-N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxybenzylamine or 1-methylamino-1-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propane, M-ALPHA. It is similar in action, but is perhaps twice as potent (a plus one or plus two dose is 60 milligrams) and of twice the duration.

The n-propylamine counterpart (as if one were to move the amine function the other direction, from the beta-carbon to the gamma-carbon of the three carbon chain of the amphetamine molecule) is gamma-3,4-methylenedioxyphenylpropylamine or 1-amino-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)propane, GAMMA. The hydrochloride salt has a mp of 204â205 Â°C. At oral levels of 200 milligrams there was some physical ill-at-ease, possible time distortion, and a feeling of being keenly aware of oneâs surroundings. The duration of effects was 4 hrs.

The phenethylamine that corresponds to MDA (removing the alpha-methyl group) is 3,4-methylenedioxyphenethylamine, or homopiperonylamine, or MDPEA, or simply H in the vocabulary of the Muni-Metro world. This compound is an entry in its own rights. The adding of another carbon atom to the alpha-methyl group of MDA gives compound J, and leads to the rest of the Muni-Metro series (K, L etc). All of this is explained under METHYL-J. The bending of this alpha-methyl group back to the aromatic ring gives an aminoindane, and with J one gets an aminotetralin. Both compounds react in animal discrimination studies identically to MDMA, and they appear to be free of neurochemical toxicity.

The two possible homologues, with either one or two methyl groups on the methylene carbon of the methylenedioxy group of MDA, are also known. The ethylidene compound (the acetaldehyde addition to the catechol group) has been encoded as EDA, and the acetone (isopropylidine addition to the catechol group) is called IDA. In animal discrimination studies, and in in vitro neurotransmitter studies, they both seem to be of decreased potency. EDA is down two to three-fold from MDA, and IDA is down by a factor of two to three-fold again. Human trials of up to 150 milligrams of the hydrochloride salt of EDA producd at best a threshold light-headedness. IDA remains untested as of the present time. The homologue of MDA (actually of MDMA) with the added carbon atom in, rather than on, the methylenedioxy ring, is a separate entry; see MDMC.

A final isomer to be mentioned is a positional isomer. The 3,4-methylenedioxy group could be at the 2,3-position of the amphetamine skeleton, giving 2,3-methylenedioxyamphetamine, or ORTHO-MDA. It appears to be a stimulant rather than another MDA. At 50 milligrams, one person was awake and alert all night, but reported no MDA-like effects.

**3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine** (also known as **MDA** , and **Tenamfetamine** , or colloquially as **"Sally"** , **"Sass"** , or **"Sass-a-frass"** ) is a synthetic [entactogen](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) of the [amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine) chemical class. It produces long-lived [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) , [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and mild [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects that include [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) , [anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression) , [enhanced feelings of empathy, affection, and sociability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement) , and [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) when [administered](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration) .

MDA was first synthesized in 1910 but its psychoactive effects were not discovered until in 1930. It was used in animal and human trials between 1939 and 1941 and from 1949 to 1957. More than 500 human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as either an [antidepressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) or [anorectic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) . By 1958, it was successfully patented as a [cough suppressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression) and ataractic. By 1961 it was patented as an [anorectic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression) under the trade name "Amphedoxamine". [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Contemporary reports suggest that MDA emerged as a recreational drug towards the end of 1967, meaning its use predates its more widely used relative [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) ( **Ecstasy** ).

As with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , MDA is thought to act primarily as a [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) - [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) - [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) and [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] However, MDA is significantly more potent by weight and subjective intensity relative to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . It also has a notably longer duration (six to eight hours instead of three to five) and produces more traditional [serotonergic psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonergic_psychedelic) effects (such as [visual distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects_-_Psychedelics) ) along with appreciably higher activity on dopamine, which is also believed to be responsible for the greater degree of neurotoxicity it produces.

Today, possession of MDA is illegal in most countries, although some limited exceptions exist for scientific and medical research.

## History and culture

MDA was originally synthesized by G. Mannish and W. Jacobson in 1910. However, its psychoactive effects were not discovered until the self-experiments of [Gordon Alles](/w/index.php?title=Gordon_Alles&action=edit&redlink=1) in July 1930. Alles would later license the drug to Smith, Kline & French. The first animal tests occurred in 1939, followed by human trials in 1941 that explored it as a possible therapy for Parkinson's disease. From 1949 to 1957, more than 500 human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as an antidepressant and anorectic by Smith, Kline & French. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The United States Army also experimented with the drug, code-named EA-1298, while working to develop a truth drug or incapacitating agent. A man named Harold Blauer died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected with 450 mg of the drug.

MDA was eventually patented as a cough suppressant by H. D. Brown in 1958, as an ataractic by Smith, Kline & French in 1960, and as an anorectic under the trade name "Amphedoxamine" in 1961. MDA began to appear on the recreational drug scene around 1967. In early 1968, the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control reported the seizure of over 1.4 kilograms of MDA and 11 kilograms of precursors from a clandestine laboratory in New York .

In 1992, a huge batch of pills known as "Snowballs" came into mass circulation in Europe, that unexpectedly contained MDA instead of MDMA. The batch unleashed a wave of extraordinary hallucinations across the UK and Europe that year, since the chemists had inaccurately dosed the pills with almost 200 mg of the active substance, which is generally enjoyed at lower amounts.

Several researchers, including Claudio Naranjo and Richard Yensen, have explored utilizing MDA in the field of psychotherapy. In 2010, Matthew Baggott and colleagues studied the ability of MDA to invoke mystical experiences and alter vision in healthy volunteers.

## Chemistry

MDA, also known as 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, is a synthetic molecule of the amphetamine family. Molecules of the amphetamine class contain a phenethylamine core featuring a phenyl ring bound to an amino (NH2) group through an ethyl chain with an additional methyl substitution at Rα. MDA also contains substitutions at R 3 and R 4 of the phenyl ring with oxygen groups. These oxygen groups are incorporated into a methylenedioxy ring through a methylene chain. MDA shares this methylenedioxy ring with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [MDAI](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDAI) and more obscure variants like [MDEA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDEA) or [MMDA](/w/index.php?title=MMDA&action=edit&redlink=1) .

## Pharmacology

MDA acts as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) and [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of the [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) known as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) , [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) . It also functions as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) , [5-HT2B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) , and [5-HT2C](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist) and shows affinity for the TAAR1, α2A-, α2B-, α2C-adrenergic receptors and [5-HT1A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) and [5-HT7](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) receptors.

The effect on serotonin may explain the similar [euphoric](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) and [empathogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects of the two compounds [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and MDA. However, MDA has a higher efficacy in stimulating the 5-HT2A [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) than MDMA; thus MDA tends to cause more [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) -like effects, such as visual [geometry](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Geometry) and [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) . While MDMA can also produce psychedelic-like visual effects, these are less pronounced than those of MDA or require a heavier dose to become apparent. It is worth noting that the role of these interactions and how they result in the [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

While MDA is similar to [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , users report that MDA has more [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) qualities and less intense [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogen) effects than MDMA. MDA is also considered to be less predictable than MDMA, with effects varying greatly from person to person.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** & **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - In terms of its effects on the user's physical energy levels, MDA is commonly considered to have the paradoxical ability to both be stimulating as well as sedating and relaxing. While MDA is described as being more "speedy" than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , as attributed of its higher [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) transporter affinity. it can also produce a pronounced sedating stoning or couch-locking effect depending on one's [set and setting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Set_and_setting) . Unlike MDMA, this can both discourage or encourage activities such as group socializing and dancing in a way that makes it a popular substance for musical events such as festivals and raves. 
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - This component typically accompanies any feelings of [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) that this compound can produce.
- **[Perception of bodily lightness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_lightness)** - This component typically accompanies any feelings of [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) that this compound can produce.
- **[Spontaneous physical sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_physical_sensations)** - The "body high" of MDA can be described as a moderate to extreme euphoric tingling sensation that radiates throughout the entire body. It is capable of becoming overwhelmingly pleasurable at higher doses and capable of immobilizing the user. This sensation maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached. 
- **[Physical euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_euphoria)** - The physical euphoria MDA has been noted to produce is often described as intensely pleasurable and all-encompassing at its peak.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - One may find surfaces such as rugs, carpets, blankets, or skin to be softer and more pleasant to the touch while under the influence of this subject's effects.
- **[Bodily control enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_control_enhancement)**
- **[Vibrating vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vibrating_vision)** - At high doses, a person's eyeballs may begin to spontaneously wiggle back and forth in a rapid motion, causing the vision to become blurry and temporarily out of focus. This is a condition known as [nystagmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nystagmus) .
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** 
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)** - As MDA is a serotonin releasing agent, a rise in core body and brain temperature tends to be high and consistent throughout the experience. Caution must be taken as too high of a dose can result in the dysregulation of the brain's ability to regulate its internal core temperature, which can result in [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) , a condition which can be fatal if left untreated.
- **[Increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** - Feelings of dry mouth and dehydration are a universal experience with this class of compounds; this effect is a product of an [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and metabolism. While it is important to avoid becoming dehydrated (especially when out dancing in a hot environment), there have been some notable cases of users suffering from [water intoxication](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Water_intoxication) through over-drinking (to compensate). It is therefore advised that users simply sip on their water and avoid over-drinking.
- **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Higher doses of MDA result in an overall difficulty when it comes to urination. This is an effect that is completely temporary and harmless. It is due to MDA’s promotion of the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH); ADH is responsible for regulating urination. This effect can be lessened by simply relaxing, but can be significantly relieved by placing a hot flannel over the genitals to warm them up and encourage blood flow to the region.
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Excessive yawning](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Excessive_yawning)**
- **[Stamina enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stamina_enhancement)**
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - This is usually only present at moderate to higher doses and is similar to what one might experience from [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Seizure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizure)** - This is a rare effect but can happen in people predisposed to them, especially when taking heavier-than-recommended doses or while in physically taxing conditions, such as being dehydrated, fatigued or undernourished. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- The visual effects of MDA have an occurrence rating that is more selective and less consistent than any of the traditional [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . The effects can never be guaranteed to manifest themselves, but are the most likely to occur with chemically pure, high dose MDA experiences, towards the end of the experience and particularly if the user has been smoking [cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis) . They are also more likely to occur if the user has prior experience with [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , but also remain entirely possible for those who have never tried them as well. Unlike [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , MDA can directly induce mild to moderate psychedelic visual effects due to its ability to partially agonize the 5HT 2A receptor, which means it has the ability to induce moderate psychedelic visual effects. 
#### Enhancements
 
MDA presents an array of visual enhancements which are mild in comparison to traditional psychedelics, but still distinctively present. These generally include:
 
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry that is present throughout this experience can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) than [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as primarily intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in style, structured in organization, dimly lit in lighting, mostly monotone in colour with blues and greys, glossy in shading, sharp in edges, small in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in round and angular corners, non-immersive in-depth and consistent in intensity. At higher doses, they are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
At high to heavy doses, MDA is capable of producing a unique range of low and high-level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is significantly less consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . These effects are far more common during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Duration#Offset) of the experience and commonly include:
 
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - This effect is very similar to the same experience found within [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) , but does not manifest itself consistently and usually happens only at high doses. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_External_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, autonomous in controllability and solid in style. They usually follow themes of memory replays and semi-realistic or expected events. For example, people could be casually holding objects or performing actions which one would expect them to be in real life before disappearing and dissolving under further inspection. Common examples of this include seeing people wearing glasses or hats when they are not and mistaking faces of friends for random people, and objects as human beings or animals.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** - The internal hallucinations which MDA induce are mostly only present as spontaneous breakthroughs at extremely high doses. This effect's [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) are delirious in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability and solid in appearance. The most common way in which they manifest themselves is through [hypnagogic](/w/index.php?title=Hypnagogic&action=edit&redlink=1) scenarios which the user may experience as they are drifting off to sleep after a night of use; these can usually be described as memory replay from the previous several hours. These are short and fleeting, but frequent and completely believable and convincing as they happen. In terms of the theme, they often take the form of conversations with the people who were with you or instead manifest themselves as bizarre and extremely nonsensical plots. ### Cognitive effects
 
- The cognitive effects of MDA can be broken down into several components which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. The headspace of MDA is described by many as one of moderate to extreme mental stimulation, feelings of love, openness or empathy, and powerful euphoria. It displays a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) and [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) cognitive effects. The most prominent of these cognitive effects generally include: 
- **[Anxiety suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety_suppression)**
- **[Cognitive euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - Strong cognitive euphoria and feelings of happiness can be produced by MDA and are likely a direct result of serotonin and dopamine release. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This particular effect is more consistent, pronounced, powerful and therapeutic with MDA than any other known substance. It is the most obvious and noticeable effect within any MDA experience and dominates the head space. With time, repeated use, and improper spacing, however, this effect becomes severely diminished as the perspective it instills becomes fully imprinted, making it, so users feel merely speedy and scattered with no new found urges to communicate or bond with others.
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Strong feelings of time compression or dilation are common within MDA and alter the experience of time quite noticeably.
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Increased sense of humor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_sense_of_humor)** 
- **[Laughter fits](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Laughter_fits)**
- **[Compulsive redosing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Compulsive_redosing)** - Due to its potential euphoria-inducing effects, there is the potential for MDA to encourage compulsive redosing, much like with MDMA. Due to the length of the experience, many find this less of an issue.
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Creativity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_enhancement)**
- **[Focus enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Focus_enhancement)** - This component is most effective at low to moderate doses as anything higher will usually impair concentration.
- **[Immersion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Immersion_enhancement)**
- **[Motivation enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)**
- **[Mindfulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mindfulness)**
- **[Thought acceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_acceleration)**
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - This component is present, but to a noticeably lesser degree than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Users often report being heavily sedated or "floored" compared to typical stimulants. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Enhancements](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_enhancement)**
- **[Hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)**
- **[Distortions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_distortion)** ### Transpersonal effects
 
- - **[Existential self-realization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Existential_self-realization)** - Although this effect is present, it is not quite as pronounced or as consistent when compared to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogen) such as [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) , [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE) . Due to the relative calmness and lack of chaotic energy that MDA possesses relative to MDMA, however, this combined with its extended duration may make it a better therapeutic agent and can be thought of as being more similar to [mescaline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mescaline) than [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) .
- **[Unity and interconnectedness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unity_and_interconnectedness)** - Experiences of unity, oneness, and interconnectedness between level 2 - 3 are common within MDA. This component most consistently manifests itself at high doses within large crowds at raves and musical events in the form of "becoming one with the crowd." ### After effects
 
- The effects which occur during the [offset](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Offset) of a [stimulant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) experience generally feel negative and uncomfortable in comparison to the effects which occurred during its [peak](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peak) . This is often referred to as a "comedown" and occurs because of [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) depletion. The comedown of MDA is generally considered harsher compared to that of [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) . Its effects commonly include: 
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)**
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)**
- **[Brain zaps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brain_zaps)** - This effect is known to happen slightly more consistently than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but does generally not occur if the user is practicing proper spacing and safe dosing practices.
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)** - This effect can occur temporarily after a strong MDA experience and persist in cases of misuse.
- **[Dream suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_suppression)** *or* **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Although this substance have been known to suppress dreaming, some users note extremely strange and sometimes scary dreams for several nights after taking large doses of MDA.
- **[Sleep paralysis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis)** - Some users report a higher incidence of experiencing sleep paralysis after consuming MDA.
- **[Irritability](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Irritability)**
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Suicidal ideation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation)** - This effect is known to happen slightly more consistently than with [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , but does generally not occur if the user is practicing proper spacing and safe dosing practices.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)**
### Experience reports

Anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) include:

- [Experience:250mg MDA / 250mg MDMA - unnecessarily large dosage](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience:250mg_MDA_/_250mg_MDMA_-_unnecessarily_large_dosage)

Additional experience reports can be found here:

- [Erowid Experience Vaults: MDA](https://erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_MDA.shtml)

## Toxicity and harm potential

Anecdotal evidence from people within the Psychonaut community who have tried MDA suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

Harold Blauer died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected with 450 mg of MDA.

MDA is also known to be more neurotoxic when compared to substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) or [MDE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDE) .

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this substance.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

As with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) , the chronic use of MDA can be considered moderately addictive with a high potential for abuse and is capable of causing psychological dependence among certain users. When addiction has developed, cravings and [withdrawal effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Withdrawal_effects) may occur if a person suddenly stops their usage.

Tolerance to the psychedelic effects of MDA is built almost immediately after ingestion. However, tolerance to the stimulant and entactogenic effects are built up after repeated and heavy usage in a manner that varies between individuals. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). MDA presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) and most [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , meaning that after the consumption of MDA all psychedelics and some stimulants will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

- **[25x-NBOMe](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOMe) & [25x-NBOH](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/25x-NBOH)** - 25x compounds are highly stimulating and physically straining. Combinations with MDA should be strictly avoided due to the risk of excessive [stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation) and heart strain. This can result in [increased blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) , [vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction) , panic attacks, [thought loops](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_loops) , [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) , and heart failure in extreme cases.
- **[Alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol)** - Combining alcohol with [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) can be dangerous due to the risk of accidental over-intoxication. Stimulants mask alcohol's [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects, which is what most people use to assess their degree of intoxication. Once the stimulant wears off, the [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) effects will be left unopposed, which can result in blackouts and severe [respiratory depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Respiratory_depression) . If mixing, the user should strictly limit themselves to only drinking a certain amount of alcohol per hour.
- **[DXM](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM)** - Combinations with DXM should be avoided due to its inhibiting effects on [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [norepinephrine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Norepinephrine) reuptake. There is an increased risk of [panic attacks](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Panic_attacks) and hypertensive crisis, or [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) with serotonin releasers ( [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) , [mephedrone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mephedrone) , etc.). Monitor blood pressure carefully and avoid strenuous physical activity.
- **[MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA)** - Any neurotoxic effects of MDMA are likely to be increased when other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) are present. There is also a risk of excessive blood pressure and heart strain (cardiotoxicity).
- **[MXE](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MXE)** - Some reports suggest combinations with MXE may dangerously increase blood pressure and increase the risk of [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **[Dissociatives](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociatives)** - Both classes carry a risk of [delusions](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusions) , [mania](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Mania) and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , and these risk may be multiplied when combined.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - MDA may be dangerous to combine with other [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants) like [cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine) as they can [increase one's heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) and [blood pressure](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_blood_pressure) to dangerous levels.
- **[Tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol)** - Tramadol is known to lower the seizure threshold and combinations with stimulants may further increase this risk.
- **[Cocaine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cocaine)** - This combination may increase strain on the heart.
- **[Amphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amphetamine)** - This combination may cause suicidal mania, paranoia, and hallucinations five days after cessation of long term amphetamine usage. This is caused by neural network disequilibrium likely related to the lack of calcium channel action by MDA.

#### Serotonin syndrome risk

Combinations with the following substances can cause dangerously high [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) levels. [Serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) requires immediate medical attention and can be fatal if left untreated.

- **MAOIs** - Such as [banisteriopsis caapi](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Banisteriopsis_caapi) , [syrian rue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Syrian_rue) , phenelzine, selegiline, and moclobemide.
- **Serotonin releasers** - Such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) , [4-FA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-FA) , [methamphetamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) , [methylone](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methylone) and [αMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/%CE%91MT) .
- **SSRIs** - Such as citalopram and sertraline
- **[SNRIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNRIs)** - Such as [tramadol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tramadol) and venlafaxine
- **5-HTP**

## Effects
MDA is closely related to MDMA. It differs mainly in how well one's own feelings are perceived (entactogenic effect), how strong empathic understanding (empathic effect) and hallucinogenic effects occur.

## Dosage
1.3 mg per kg body weight (1.3 mg x 80 kg = 100 mg)

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
Nausea to nausea, dry mouth, cramping of the jaw muscles, sweating, coordination disorders, sleep disorders and trembling.

### Long-term Risks
MDA is both neurotoxic (damaging to the nerves) and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver); regular use can lead to schizophrenia-like symptoms.

## Safer Use
- First test a third or half a pill.
- Wait two hours for the effect to take effect before adding more.
- With MDA, topping up is pointless, as it is effective for a long time even in small doses.
- Refrain from mixed consumption.
- Avoid alcohol, drink enough non-alcoholic beverages (0.3-0.5 L per hour).
- Take breaks from dancing at parties and get some fresh air in between.
- Take regular breaks from consumption. The body needs time to recover.
- People taking medication are advised to inform themselves about interactions.

MDA is an entactogen and stimulant that can provide some psychedelic effects. It’s often compared to MDMA, which it resembles in many ways. They differ in that MDA is usually more stimulating, more psychedelic, and lasts a little longer.

The drug has been used recreationally since the 1960s and research began earlier in the 1900s. Much like MDMA, it may be useful in psychotherapy.

Neurotoxicity is a concern with the substance, which is why minimizing your use, taking common doses, keeping your temperature low, and supplementing are important.

**MDA** (Methylenedioxyamphetamine) is an popular drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine class knownthat is mainly used as a recreational drug, an entheogen, and a tool in use to supplement various types of practices  for transcendence, including in meditation, psychonautics, and as an  agent in psychedelic psychotherapy.

It most frequently comes in tablet form, although it is also found in capsules or as powder. MDA is also known as "sass" or "sassafras"and several other names.

## History

MDA was first synthesized by G. Mannish and W. Jacobson in 1910.

It was first ingested in July 1930 by Gordon Alles who then licensed the drug to Smith Kline and French. MDA was first used in animal tests in 1939, and human trials began in 1941 in the exploration of possible therapies for Parkinson's disease. From 1949 to 1957, more than 500 human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as an antidepressant and/or anorectic by Smith, Kline & French.

The United States Army also experimented with the drug, code named EA-1298, while working to develop a truth drug or incapacitating agent. One human subject died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected with 450 mg of the drug.

MDA was patented as a cough suppressant by H. D. Brown in 1958, as an ataractic by Smith, Kline & French in 1960, and as an anorectic under the trade name “Amphedoxamine” in 1961. Several researchers, including Claudio Naranjo and Richard Yensen, have explored MDA in the field of psychotherapy.

MDA began to appear on the recreational drug scene around 1963 to 1964. It was then inexpensive and readily available as a research chemical from several scientific supply houses. Although now illegal, MDA continues to be bought, sold, and used as a recreational 'love drug', due to its enhancement of empathy.

## Dosage

{{#tdose: mda }}

## Duration

| Onset | 20-90 minutes |
| --- | --- |
| Peak | 2-4 hours |
| Total | 4-8 hours |
| After-effects | 3-24 hours |

## Effects

### Postive

- Extreme mood lift

- Increased willingness to communicate

- Increase in energy (stimulation)

- Ego softening

- Feelings of comfort, belonging, and closeness to others

- Feelings of love and empathy

- Forgiveness

- Increased awareness & appreciation of music

- Increased awareness of senses  (taste, smell, touch, hearing, vision)

- Profound life-changing spiritual experiences

- Neurotically based fear dissolution

- Sensations bright and intense

- Urge to hug and kiss people

### Neutral

- Decreased appetite

- Visual distortion

- Rapid, involuntary eye jiggling (nystagmus)

- Mild visual hallucinations

- Moderately increased heart rate and blood pressure (increases with dose)

- Restlessness, nervousness, shivering

- Change in body temperature regulation

- Strong desire to do or want more when coming down

### Negative

- Inappropriate and/or unintended emotional bonding

- Tendency to say things you might feel uncomfortable about later

- Mild to extreme jaw clenching (trisma), tongue and cheek chewing, and teeth grinding (bruxia)

- Difficulty concentrating & problems with activities requiring linear focus

- Short-term memory scramble or loss & confusion

- Muscle tension

- Erectile disfunction and difficulty reaching orgasm

- Increase in body temperature, hyperthermia, dehydration (drink water)

- Hyponatremia (don't drink too much water)

- Nausea and vomiting

- Headaches, dizziness, loss of balance, and vertigo

- Post-trip Crash - unpleasantly harsh comedown from the peak effect

- Hangover the next day, lasting days to weeks

- Mild depression and fatigue for up to a week

- Severe depression and/or fatigue (uncommon)

- Possible strong urge to repeat the experience, though not physically addictive

- Possible psychological crisis requiring hospitalization (psychotic episodes, severe panic attacks, etc) (rare)

- Possible liver toxicity (rare)

- Neurotoxicity

- Small risk of death. Assuming similar risk to MDMA, approximately 2 per 100,000 users have extreme negative reactions resulting in death (rare)

#### Hangover

Many users [report feeling extremely drained the day after MD(M)A use](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_effects_hangover1.shtml). This 'day after' effect means for many MD(M)A users that they need to plan 2 days for the experience: one for the peak experience and one recovery day, with very little planned. Many users also experience some level of post-MD(M)A depression, often starting on the second day after the experience and lasting for up to 5 days. A small percentage of users report depressive symptoms for weeks afterwards. Alternately, some users report feeling better than normal for a week or so after taking MD(M)A . The negative after-effects of taking MDMA appear to be worse with higher frequencies of use, higher dosages, and perhaps total lifetime usage.

## Harm Reduction

MDA rapidly builds tolerance, depletes serotonin and compounds neurotoxicity issues. Look for other drugs and avoid using MDA more than once every few months.

Ecstasy tablets are notoriously impure, often containing chemicals other than MDA. Check out [EcstasyData](http://www.ecstasydata.org/) and [Pill Reports](http://pillreports.com/) for pill testing results. Buy a [Test Kit](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Test_Kit)!

See [Psychedelic Harm Reduction](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Psychedelics#Harm_Reduction) for general information.

### Interactions

MDA can cause [Serotonin Syndrome](/index.php?title=Serotonin_Syndrome&action=edit&redlink=1) when combined with MAOIs. Refer to [Drug combinations](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Drug_combinations) for more information.

[SSRIs and SNRIs block most effects of MD(M)A.](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/mdma/mdma_info9.shtml)

## Chemistry and Pharmacology

Chemical name: (R) 1-(benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl)propan-2-amine

Take a look at [MDMA Chemistry and Pharmacology](https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/MDMA#Chemistry_and_Pharmacology). MDA is around five times as neurotoxic as MDMA and should not be used frequently.

## Legal status

MDA is legally controlled in most of the world under the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances and other international agreements, although exceptions exist for research and limited medical use. In general, the unlicensed use, sale or manufacture of MDA are all criminal offences.

3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is an entactogen, stimulant, and psychedelic drug of the amphetamine and MDxx families that is encountered mainly as a recreational drug. It is usually taken orally.
In terms of its pharmacology, MDA is a serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent (SNDRA) and a serotonin 5-HT2 receptor agonist, including of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. It has a duration of 5 to 8 hours.
MDA has a long history of psychotherapeutic and recreational use that predates that of MDMA, dating back to at least the mid-1960s. It has been described as the first entactogen. MDA has also been described as probably the most popular analogue of MDMA. In most countries, the drug is a controlled substance and its possession and sale are illegal.

## Use and effects

MDA is bought, sold, and used as a recreational drug due to its enhancement of mood and empathy. It produces MDMA-like effects, including entactogenic and stimulant effects, as well as mild psychedelic effects.
The dose range of MDA given in Alexander Shulgin's book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines I Have Known and Loved) and other sources is 80 to 160 mg. A wider recreational dose range for MDA of 20 to 200 mg or more, with a typical dose estimate of 90 mg, has also been reported. The dose range of MDA is very similar to that of MDMA.
The effects of MDA include euphoria, empathy, emotional amplification, relaxation, feeling at peace with the world, increased introspection, self-awareness, and acceptance, authenticity, clarity of thought, a desire to communicate with others and relate personal issues, and emotional bonding with others. These effects led to MDA being called the "love drug" or "hug drug". MDA also produces mild psychedelic effects, including brightened colors, closed-eye visuals or complex mental imagery, synaesthesia, and rarely mild hallucinations. It does not produce profound sensory disruption or overt hallucinations. In any case, the drug has still been found to produce mystical or spiritual experiences.
MDA shares most of MDMA's qualitative and emotional effects, including entactogenic and stimulant effects. However, it has been said to be slightly less stimulating than MDMA. In addition, MDA's hallucinogenic effects are much greater than those of MDMA, although still less than those of classical psychedelics like psilocybin. Another difference between the two drugs is that MDA appears to produce a more introverted and emotionally intense prosocial state, while MDMA encourages a more extroverted and gregarious prosocial state.
Besides its psychoactive effects, MDA produces sympathomimetic effects such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, among other physiological effects.
In terms of the individual enantiomers of MDA, (R)-MDA produces psychedelic effects and some entactogenic effects, while (S)-MDA is non-hallucinogenic, produces similar entactogenic effects as the racemate, and has considerable stimulant effects. High doses of enantiopure (R)-MDA, in the range of 120 to 200 mg, are described as closely resembling the effects of LSD, for instance doses of 200 to 400 μg. Enantiopure (R)-MDA at high doses produces more robust psychedelic effects than typical doses of racemic MDA.
The duration of MDA is about 5 to 8 hours and is about 2 hours longer than that of MDMA (3–6 hours). Shulgin originally gave a duration of MDA of 8 to 12 hours in PiHKAL, but he later revised this down to only 3 to 6 hours. A modern clinical study gave a duration of 6 to 8 hours.

## Side effects

Side effects of MDA include sympathomimetic effects like increased heart rate and blood pressure as well as increased cortisol and prolactin levels.

## Overdose

Symptoms of acute toxicity may include agitation, sweating, increased blood pressure and heart rate, dramatic increase in body temperature, convulsions, and death. Death is usually caused by cardiac effects and subsequent hemorrhaging in the brain (stroke). A 450 mg intravenous injection of MDA was found to result in death in one case.

## Interactions

## Pharmacology

### Pharmacodynamics

MDA is a substrate of the serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, and vesicular monoamine transporters, and in relation to this, acts as a reuptake inhibitor and releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine (that is, it is an SNDRATooltip serotonin–norepinephrine–dopamine releasing agent). It is also an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors and shows affinity for the α2A-, α2B-, and α2C-adrenergic receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors.
In addition to its actions as a monoamine releasing agent, MDA is a potent high-efficacy partial agonist or full agonist of the rodent TAAR1. Conversely, MDA is much weaker in terms of potency as an agonist of the human TAAR1. Moreover, MDA acts as a very weak partial agonist or antagonist of the human TAAR1 rather than as an efficacious agonist. TAAR1 activation is thought to auto-inhibit and constrain the effects of amphetamines that act as TAAR1 agonists, for instance MDMA in rodents.
MDA fully substitutes for MDMA in rodent drug discrimination tests. However, its prosocial effects in rodents are said to not fully resemble those of MDMA. MDA also substitutes for stimulants like dextroamphetamine and cocaine in drug discrimination tests. The (S)-optical isomer of MDA is more potent than the (R)-optical isomer as a psychostimulant, possessing greater activity at the monoamine transporters. MDA and (R)-MDA but not (S)-MDA fully substitute for serotonergic psychedelics including DOM, LSD, and mescaline. Similarly, MDA and (R)-MDA produce the head-twitch response, a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects, in rodents. However, the head-twitch response they produce is very weak in magnitude compared to other related psychedelics such as the DOx drugs. On the other hand, the response is more similar in magnitude to that of Ariadne.
In terms of the subjective and behavioral effects of MDA, it is thought that serotonin release is required for its entactogenic effects, dopamine release is required for its euphoriant (rewarding and addictive) effects, dopamine and norepinephrine release are required for its psychostimulant effects,  and direct agonism of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is required for its mild psychedelic effects. The entactogenic effects of drugs like MDA are thought to dependent on a precise balance of serotonin and dopamine release as well as serotonin receptor agonism. The longer duration of MDA compared to MDMA appears to be related to pharmacodynamics as opposed to pharmacokinetics, for instance the effects of MDA depending relatively more on serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonism than on serotonin release.
MDA can produce serotonergic neurotoxic effects in rodents. This might in part be due to metabolism of MDA. In addition, MDA activates a response of the neuroglia, though this subsides after use.

### Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of MDA have been studied. Its duration of action has been reported to be about 6 to 8 hours. The duration of MDA is longer than that of MDMA, about 8 hours for MDA versus 6 hours for MDMA. The elimination half-life of MDA is 10.9 hours. Differences in the duration of MDA versus MDMA may be due pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics.

## Chemistry

MDA is a substituted methylenedioxylated phenethylamine and amphetamine derivative. In relation to other phenethylamines and amphetamines, it is the 3,4-methylenedioxy, α-methyl derivative of β-phenylethylamine, the 3,4-methylenedioxy derivative of amphetamine, and the N-desmethyl derivative of MDMA.
It is a common adulterant of illicitly produced MDMA.

### Synonyms

In addition to 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, MDA is also known by other chemical synonyms such as the following:

α-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxy-β-phenylethylamine
1-(3,4-Methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-propanamine
1-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-propanamine

### Synthesis

MDA is typically synthesized from essential oils such as safrole or piperonal. Common approaches from these precursors include:

Reaction of safrole's alkene functional group with a halogen containing mineral acid followed by amine alkylation.

Wacker oxidation of safrole to yield 3,4-methylenedioxyphenylpropan-2-one (MDP2P) followed by reductive amination or via reduction of its oxime.
Henry reaction of piperonal with nitroethane followed by nitro compound reduction.
Darzens reaction on heliotropin was also done by J. Elks, et al. This gives MDP2P, which was then subjected to a Leuckart reaction.
The "two dogs" or "dopeboy" clandestine method, starting with helional as a precursor. First, an oxime is created using hydroxylamine. Then, a Beckmann rearrangement is performed with nickel acetate to form the amide. Then a Hofmann rearrangement is done to form the freebase amine of MDA. Then it is purified with an acid base extraction.

### Detection in body fluids

MDA may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine to monitor for use, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning or assist in the forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal violation or a sudden death. Some drug abuse screening programs rely on hair, saliva, or sweat as specimens. Most commercial amphetamine immunoassay screening tests cross-react significantly with MDA and major metabolites of MDMA, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish and separately measure each of these substances. The concentrations of MDA in the blood or urine of a person who has taken only MDMA are, in general, less than 10% those of the parent drug.

### Analogues and derivatives

Analogues of MDA include its positional isomer 2,3-methylenedioxyamphetamine (2,3-MDA) and others. MDMA is the N-methyl derivative of MDA.
MDA constitutes part of the core structure of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist protokylol.

## History

MDA was first synthesized by Carl Mannich and W. Jacobsohn in 1910. It was first taken in July 1930 by Gordon Alles at a total dose of 126 mg, who experienced hallucinogenic effects, well-being and euphoria, and peripheral effects. However, he did not subsequently describe these effects until 1959. Alles later licensed the drug to Smith, Kline & French. MDA was first used in animal tests in 1939, and human trials began in 1941 in the exploration of possible therapies for Parkinson's disease. However, it was found to be detrimental in people with Parkinson's disease. The drug was described as having analeptic effects in humans in 1953. From 1949 to 1957, more than five hundred human subjects were given MDA in an investigation of its potential use as an antidepressant or appetite suppressant by Smith, Kline & French.
The United States Army also experimented with the drug, code named EA-1298, while working to develop a truth drug or incapacitating agent. Harold Blauer died in January 1953 after being intravenously injected, without his knowledge or consent, with 450 mg of the drug as part of Project MKUltra. MDA was patented as an ataractic by Smith, Kline & French in 1960, and as an anorectic under the trade name "Amphedoxamine" in 1961. MDA began to appear on the recreational drug scene around 1963 to 1964. It was then inexpensive and readily available as a research chemical from several scientific supply houses. Several researchers, including Claudio Naranjo and Richard Yensen, have explored MDA in the field of psychotherapy.
The International Nonproprietary Name (INN) tenamfetamine was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1986. It was recommended in the same published list in which the INN of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromoamphetamine (DOB), brolamfetamine, was recommended. These events suggest that MDA and DOB were under development as potential pharmaceutical drugs at the time. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) was also founded in 1986.
Matthew J. Baggott and colleagues conducted some of the first modern clinical studies of MDA in humans and published their findings in the 2010s.
