I'm considering trying this stuff in the next few weeks.


![Escaline.png](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=http%3A%2F%2Fupload.wikimedia.org%2Fwikipedia%2Fcommons%2Fb%2Fb9%2FEscaline.png&hash=052ab6468346035f0426e3b35155bf32)


Does anyone have experience with escaline? How similar is it to mescaline? I love mescaline, but it's such a pain to extract. I would love to find something similar that's easier to acquire.


The very few experience reports ([here](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=92170) and [here](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/473807-escaline-first-time-at-50-mg)) that I've been able to find sound promising. They both seem to hint at its comparatively mild nature, but mescaline is also pretty mild at low doses. The only thing that troubles me is the body load. TMA-2 was also pretty similar to mescaline for me, except that it was milder and caused this nasty joint tension and pain. 2C-T-2, was also pretty close to mescaline, which might bode well for escaline ... ?

The pihkal entry doesn't make me want to try it tbh. Sounds heavy on the body.

I got into a deep discussion, but I was not argumentative or even defensive and I remained detached and kept a tone of cool impersonality. I had a good appetite. But I also had some tachycardia and muscular tension. There was unquestionable sensory enhancement, but without an intellectual component. Overall it was most pleasant.

Interesting, I was just about to make a thread on this for the same reason. I will most likely pick some up when my source offers it around the holidays. I'll be sure to report in once I try it, but I can't say for certain how soon that will be. Anyone else have anything they can chime in with here?

I  tried 3C-E , 3C-P , Proscaline , TMA , TMA-6 , TMA-2 with analogue/homologue of Mescaline . 

3C-P at this moment is my favourite homologue of mescaline , very deeply and empathogen ( something like combo Mescaline + MDMA ) ( Max dose 45 mg)

3C-E is very interesting compound something between LSD/Mescaline ( 50 mg) so  I belive that Escaline can be very interesting substance. For few days I am going take 60 mg and I will let you know when I finish  research,

I'm also quite interested, with at least some prospect to actually try this.  Small & Handifying this thread considering I searched for escaline earlier and we seem to be missing data and discussion on it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

So 3C-P could be the more promising chemical of the two?

Yes, plugging it will be quite effective, as with any drug. I would avoid mixing it with 25I, especially because they are both so new and you've not done escaline before. There should be no need.


Try googling, as shulgin has a good report on escaline.

Damn, what the fuck is your problem? Get out of here; I see nothing in his post whatsoever that is indicative of trollish behaviour, and his post contains nothing offensive or annoying. It is his first post on this board and he is greeted with a piece of nasty shit like this? All he is asking is what dose of a particular compound to start with, and to find out if anyone has combo'd it with another psychedelic.


@acousticman420: Welcome to Bluelight! Please ignore the crabby comments of certain posters. 


Plugging it should work well, but because this is such a new compound, you will be one of the first to explore that territory. Start with a dose about 3x lower than an oral dose just in case. Plugged doses of phenethylamines are often about twice if not more potent than oral doses. Take a look at the [Pihkal page on escaline](http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pihkal/pihkal072.shtml) and work out your doses from there; 40mg is the lowest dose there, so I would try no more than 15mg up the ass first just to get a feel for how potent it might be.


Don't combine it with anything on your first time out. Always get to know compounds on their own first before you consider a combo. 


Good luck!

There are a few mescaline analogs out now and his post is not bullshit whatsoever, try doing some research before calling bullshit.


OP I should be able to research this soon as well, I wouldn't combine with 25i until you know how Escaline effects you.


[http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=95734](http://www.drugs-forum.com/forum/showthread.php?t=95734) here is a report describing somebody going up to what they believe was 100mgs and having a good time, I would start lower around 50mgs though because the very few reports around are around that range.

Any time ago I tried 60 mg . The experience was quite similar to 350 mg of mescaline ( headspace and bodyfeeling) . Very interesting compound . I think that full potency of this substance will be approx 100 mg . Next time I will try in other s&s because first time was on psytrance event and in my opinion Mescaline like their homologues has full potency  when are taken for a day. Btw this class od compounds looks very safe in dosage , I know person who took 300 mg 3C-P intranasally.

Psykap, did you find the sense of well-being and peace ("all is well with the world, everything is as it should be") with escaline? That's all I look for anymore, and is my favorite part of mescaline. If you didn't find it in escaline, was it there in 3C-P?

whew hoo just finished school for the week and have 1g of escaline sitting right beside me. Going to try 60mg in about now, can't wait, it's been a long time since i've tripped properly (other than vaping 5-meo-dalt). 


i just took 60mg in a cap and 10mg sublingual, time to turn off skype and get weird for the night!


Any one explore other ROA with this? vape/plug/insufflated? If no one else has i'll be the guineau pig for the vape department and possibly the plugging. i imagine by the taste that this stuff will hurt the nose much like a 2c would, though it is less bitter in taste.


edit: god this stuff takes forever to kick in, just starting to kick after smoking a joint of hash oil. No nausea yet, took some immodium to avoid the inevitable shits that come from PEAs. Will write a TR tomorrow. definitely starting to hit at +2 hours, feels like a 2c but unique so far anyway, time to wait for the peak, music enhance is already here. 


update at +4 hours: holy shit i am high, this is like mescaline but much more smooth and no nausea. The visuals are unique for sure, not like mescaline, not like 2c-x or nbome. This is a great substance IMO, completely lucid (well mostly), tripping mind state and visuals (visuals remind me of 25i kind of, in that can't see everything is moving kind of way).


update at +8 hours - still going strong, very strong +++, very smooth, no jitters, no anxiety, bit of rushing here and there though. I think this is a fucking amazing substance, it will not be going away any time soon i bet.

Sounds good RobotRipping, very interesting. This has just come available in limited quantities it seems from a vendor I use just these last few weeks, hoping they still have stock of it come pay-day. Missed out on samples of NBOMe-Mesc in the past, still not found a good source for Allylescaline, the Peruvian Torch I boiled up didn't get anywhere near a trip so fingers crossed I don't miss out again. Seems to have appeared from nowhere this, not even heard of it before mid-December but suddenly available widely it would seem? Hope that bodes well for future stocks. Compared to 25x-NBOMes and 4-AcO-DMT it looks pricey at the minute if 100mg-ish is a full dose but well worth it for novelty value by the looks of things.

I agree it's not dose dependent and not to shoot for a 100mg dose. ++++ are usually too intense anyway, a strong +++ is what you should aim for. If it happens to end up being more then that's great.

Sounds like you found a gem %) How was your tolerance before you did the 60mg +10mg trip?  If you could share the times for onset, coming up and plateau at that does it would be nice to know. Good to read that there is no nausea %)

anyone that tried that so far care to share some insights on the come up. i'm particular interested in the bodyload with different ROAs and how it compares to for instance 2C-E/P nasal which have very nasty, shakey and uneasy comeups for most people.

the come up isn't rough at all, very smooth IMO (i take etizolam too though so it may be worse than i think). I'd say the come up is comparable to 2c-i, or more closely 25i-nbome, except it takes at least 2 hours for it to kick in. I had no psych tolerance when i took my 70mg dose last night, i just took 60mg like half an hour ago so i'll be able to tell you guys how bad this one is for tolerance. WIth most 2c-x drugs i could trip 3 nights in a row before things got pointless and the nbomes well sometimes id be able to do 2 nights in a row with the second night having a double dose. 


The come up is much easier than 2c-e/p, i think 2c-e has one of the worst come ups, especially nasally. I am reluctant to snort a line of escaline after hurting my nose recently by snorting 4-emc. If it hurts anything like 2c-e does then i won't bother, i'm waiting for someone else to give it a shot first ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Vaporizing has no come up really, just hits in you in a couple of minutes which is weird, i don't think that ROA is worthwhile at all though as there's no rush and it's not intense whatsoever, the effects being far less than an oral dose. I tried plugging 30mg but i think something went wrong as i fell asleep an hour later with no effects other than a sore bum. I don't think i got it all the way in there. I dunno maybe escaline is a pro drug for something else, i've never vaped a psych and not had a rush. 


i also have some methylone on hand and will likely combine 100mg if i feel the 60mg tonight wasn't enough. I think it's a safe combo but there are so few reports on escaline that this is all just guess work. I don't like to be the guinea pig but escaline feels safe to me (then again so did 25i-nbome). 


Something to note: the day after the trip, i slept for 14 hours, could not get up whatsoever. I haven't eaten much in the last 2 days, other than that i feel fine now and ready to trip again. I have stuff to do tomorrow so hopefully i don't end up sleeping the whole day again.

Escaline is just like mescaline, but than without the M for Magic...


What I try to say is that this compound is definitely a psychedelic, it is definitely a nice and interesting compound, but it is nothing special.


I tried about 55 mg of this compound, which produced a nice psychedelic experience without any visual aspects. Which in itself can be really valuable, but I guess I was kinda expecting a little of the magic that mescaline has, but unfortunately, there was none.


In general, I don't think it really felt like a 'classic' phenethylamine (like, mescaline or 2C-B etc..), but more like it is in a class of it's own.


The beginning of the experience was dominated by a heavy, but most enjoyable body-load. After ±4 h there was a sudden burst of energy, not like you're on a stimulant, but just the inability to sit still. In total the whole experience lasted about 10-11 h. The next trail is probably gonna be around 65-70 mg. I think the previously mentioned 100 mg would be to much in terms of body-load.

I'd like to try this one, just for curiosity's sake.


I found the alpha methylated version, 3C-E, to be the least worthwhile psychedelic I've tried since 4-aco-dipt.


Horrible bodyload load and side-effects coupled with very little psychedelia. I only took 40 mg, might try it again at 60 mg, if it just hadn't given me some bruxism in the end.

It's possible that 50-55mg is threshold with a sudden curve into magic territory at 60-70mg. Someone should do  trials at 60mg and 75mg to see what they entail. 


Already we have a few reports on 55mg, 60+10(70)mg, and the other sparse reports scattered around, one that showed threshold effects at 50mg and this thread over on another forum about a '100mg' dose which didn't seem ego shattering, but rather enjoyable, a full trip. He's not precise on the dose he took, but it might have been less.

50mg tested. Although mescaline has never been tried here, escaline had characteristics so similar to it's description that I'm pretty sure most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two if told they had mescaline instead.


Amount: 50mg

ROA: Oral (with 500mg antacid tablet of Calcium Carbonate)

Duration: ~12 hours; 2-3 hours come-up, 8 hour peak, 4 hours comedown


Effects noted:

-Increased laughter/humor

-Increased appreciation for the world

-No jaw clenching

-Serenity/feeling of peace

-Fluid control of physical and mental self

-Anxiety free/no stress

-Increased color contrast empathetic towards a a dark and rich color palette

-Emphasis of patterns in the real world

-No body load/extremely minimal physical unease

-Some nausea for the first two hours but the remainder of the experience was non-nauseating

-Increased awareness of others and self

-Euphoria

-Increased understanding

-Feeling of being part of a whole

-Slight muscle relaxation

-Slight drunken feeling


This is a compound that is definitely a keeper. The experience overall was very beautiful and my vision was so enhanced to the point that everything looked majestic. The majority of the day was spent smiling and laughing with friends in the most jovial mood. Nothing was annoying or bothersome and everyone was very easy to be around. Walking around a nature trail was completely fantastic to see nature at work, it was one of the best parts of the experience. Experience was rated a high ++. 100mg is the next trial and it seems like that is where a +++ experience will undoubtedly happen.

Based on the description of effects given for mescaline experiences, the symptoms and effects pair so well with escaline that I would easily confuse which one is being described if a blind or double-blind experiment were to be done.

I don't agree, I haven't felt those specific collective effects on a single psychedelic. DOC always provides jaw clenching, aMT is not serene for me, 2-CE always has an intense body load, and so on. I am pretty sure the collective effects I listed do not apply to all psychedelics since each psychedelic has it's own characteristic. Ultimately, I will leave it at that. If you would like to try escaline and agree or disagree, then I welcome that but I'm not going to modify the list of effects of what was felt.


And yes, if I gave someone the effect list/report provided for escaline and the effect list/report of mescaline at an equipotent dosage, it would probably be difficult for someone to easily discriminate between the two without scrutinizing each report.

I feel that the psychedelic experience is very similar no matter what drug is taken. "You know, they all do sort of the same thing, rearrange what you thought was real." I believe Tim Leary said it. There's obvious differences in timeline, body load, or visual aspects. But, by just reading trip reports, you can't really tell how close one experience is to another. By just reading reports on DOC I thought it would be very close to LSD. Boy was I wrong. 


On another note, escaline has me interested. Can anyone give me a proper timeline for it?

I would imagine the chemical analogy mescaline is to escaline as 2c-d is to 2c-e should be cogent. Though I have yet to taste escaline, it is fairly high on my to do list.


When it comes to comparisons such as these I think the individual in question may be more significant than the drug itself. Someone that's tripped a few times would probably say they're pretty much equivalent. However someone with a more sophisticated psychedelic palette could probably tease out a world of difference between the two. Much like while many of us may not be able to discern malbecs grown in different regions of Argentina, a seasoned sommolier would. All about frame of reference. 


That being said I am looking forward to trying escaline in the near future. I've enjoyed mescaline &allylescaline, though I felt the latter a touch lacking in a couple areas. From what I've read it seems the ethoxy maybe a little more well rounded. I'm also quite curious about the "drunken" like state mentioned in PiHKAL & this thread.

The drunken-like state was not the disinhibition side of drunkenness, but the slight loss of balance, analgesia, relaxation and body sensation that being drunk induces. Walking wasn't impaired significantly, but it was noticeable to one's self that trying to walk in a straight line took a little bit more effort than usual.

I'm really surprised there hasn't been more activity in this thread, given that one of the most established and respected vendors in Europe has been carrying Escaline for at least a few weeks now.


I've not got much to add myself except to add some confirmation on the dose range. I tried 40mg at the weekend and was rewarded with barely threshold effects. A slight enhancement of colours and a very faint hint of movement in the grain of my wooden doors and that's about it. Noticeable after about 2 hours and gone a few hours after that.


Hopefully I'll have the chance to dose higher next weekend, I may jump straight to 60mg as I only have 1/4g to play with.

I have been lurking BL for about a decade and a half and FINALLY have something I can contribute to in any reasonable amount.  I picked up a gram of Escaline and dissolved it into 200ml of vodka for liquid dosing purposes (the dissolution of which was almost instantaneous) and 250mg of Etizolam just in case the trip needed to be aborted or at the very least as a way to shorten the duration of the psychedelic dead zone after you are pretty much down but can't sleep for another hour or four.  


In terms of my experience with other related substances, I have ingested mushrooms many many times, LSD in the area of 20ish times and 2c-i in the area of 10 times.  I also partake regularly in any opiate or opiate like thing I can get my hands on but only oral or nasal ROA.  I have a good amount of experience with MDMA, Metyhlone, DXM, Ketamine and Marijuana.  Hopefully between all of that I can come up with some baseline comparisons!


Two subjects (myself and S) ingested 75mg of Escaline, I'm a male of about 240lbs, S is a male of about 160lbs.  S recently went through a breakup and has been stressing a bit about an apartment he rents out to professionals that has suffered damage from the recent crazy weather, he seems to be taking everything well in stride but he had a previous large dose of acid (800mic) that went pretty badly off the rails a couple years ago so I do my best to make sure he is aware of what he might be signing up for.  Given the few reports of this chemical indicating a fairly gentle effect on the psyche (and a common thread to most Mescaline reports), he felt confident that he is in a good enough head space.


Our plan for the evening is music for the come up (starting at 2100h), watch the movie Samsara at some point around peak, go outside for a walk if the peak is too much or after the movie if we are not too overstimulated and then crash out doing pretty much whatever we feel like.  The first tingles of the come up start about 20 minutes after ingesting and by 2 hours we are pretty much fully feeling it.  There is definite bodyload, but it is pretty minimal compared to other psychedelics, mostly slight indigestion, a feeling of not quite knowing what to do with yourself and not being able to find that nice comfortable spot to sit or stand and not feel like you need to readjust constantly.  


My best point of comparison for the trip overall is a low to mid dose of 2c-i, similar enhancement of colours, breathing objects and super sparkly reflective surfaces but light on the visuals.  To the plus, I always found 2c-i to be super stimmy and I would walk around my apartment in circles to expend the energy, not at all the case for Escaline, it had an almost depersonalizing effect.  The euphoria was a true-er euphoria than 2c-i, felt more natural and whole so that was a plus.  In terms of depersonalizing, I felt almost like the first small line of Ketamine, kind of pushed out of my body a bit, content to just sit back against a couch and let things happen.  


A great use for this drug would be to watch the movies/videos/concerts/etc. that you see sober and think "that would probably be great to watch high" because it really enhances the visuals but leaves them intact (whereas a good dose of acid will render a movie you have seen a huge number of times almost unrecognizable at points).  That said, Samsara was pretty awesome, also, despite the inability to really put forward any useful discussion, you stay in a pretty grounded head space.  This was helpful for some of the more challenging scenes that might be slightly more traumatic on a strong psychedelic.


(four hours in, two hours of peak, 0100h) We decided to take a walk to the local gas station (probably 20 minutes while sober) and found that a good amount of the two feet of snow that had recently fallen had melted during the day and completely refroze into pretty much road length skating rinks.  This made for a highly uncoordinated and rather hilarious hour and a bit walk to the store with plenty of stops to appreciate how awesome ice encrusted snow looked under a street light or to watch a solitary car drive slowly down a wide stretch of road.  On a previous acid trip S and I had gone to a gas station to buy smokes and made it half way through the transaction until we both started laughing uncontrollably like maniacs and ended up just throwing money on the counter and running away due to the absurdity of the situation, S noted that this time we held our shit together through the transaction quite commendably.


Around 0500 we started feeling kind of tired and though still feeling generally pretty good, slight discomforts started becoming more apparent so I suggested we take some etizolam and ease out of it a bit.  This was also my first time taking etizolam (also liquid dosing) and we took about 2.5mg each by dropper.  It hit me like a truck (full of pillows) and within 20 seconds I was grinning like an idiot and feeling JUST fine.  The trip back to the couch was sublime and for the first time since dosing I felt like I found a totally perfect position to hole up in to.  We listened to music for another hour and a half as it had become even more amazing than earlier and then promptly fell asleep (easiest come down off a psychedelic I have ever had).


My major thoughts - Don't go in expecting anything more than one hit of acid or roughly 2.5g psilocybe at this dosage, it was on the weaker end by far of my psychedelic adventures.  It is a hell of a lot easier than either of those, but the lack of challenge also seems to present a bit of a lack of reward (no epiphanies, and if anything, my thinking was more streamlined and subdued than when sober) and no brain shattering awe at my surroundings (though things admittedly looked quite pleasant). I really wish I had the chance to try Mescaline before this so I could compare directly to that (still waiting to find a place to grow my bridgesii).  At this dose, totally pleasant and worthwhile use of a night, nice to have absolutely no thoughts that strayed to the dark side, no feelings of too much intensity, super easy psychedelic all around.  The euphoria was really solid but it fluxed a bit with discomfort (which never got bad though, so the euphoria won out completely) and I think this substance makes a perfect enhancer to stimuli you already enjoy.  


That said, I am looking to take this up step by step to 100, 125 and 150mg.  If it is like my experience with 2c-i, the bodyload and side effects are reasonably similar between low and medium-high doses while the visuals and offbeat thought patterns increase significantly.  Despite the difference in body weight, S felt pretty similar about his experience in comparison to mine, he is a bit of a hard head for substances though, but I would suggest (given that you are quite confident you have Escaline) skipping the 50mg-60mg zone.  I have no real basis to see how this plays out as more people take it, but I feel like it will open up at higher doses and I think we might be looking at the 125-150 range (unfortunately, as that makes it significantly more expensive than when I considered that 50mg might be the magic dose).   I really got a feeling like when I take a single hit of acid and think "hey, this is fun, easy, interesting, etc. but I can't wait to take two tabs next time and get 'there'".  Also, with these novel chems, it can take a long time to find the sweet spot as many people rightly don't like to be the first to take the risk.  


To the mods, this is definitely a trip report, I can move it over there if you would like and maybe write more of a quick summary here.  I felt like this might be a good place to start though as there is SO little info about this substance and the great majority of it can be found in this thread.  Please advize.  Also, if anyone has any specific questions, I'll try to get back to you promptly.

Cracking report buddy, very helpful. Lets hope we see more reports from you! 


I'm looking forward to trying this substance as I've always been interested in mescaline but have never gotten hold of it & am not fond of the idea of extracting it myself. It sounds to me as if this Escaline might be an interesting place to look for mescaline-like effects without the arsing around with extractions. 


Very interesting!

You could do one better by leaving it in here, as it is a sparse thread, *and* posting it to Trip Reports, as I am sure they would love to see it too. Perhaps you could also do a little summary/conclusion for those short on time? Thanks for making the effort ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**Be bold, be brave. Be a fucking idiot, be brilliant.**


Escaline Experiences:


*edit:* Please forgive my writing, I do not have time to proof-read and edit in fine detail but it should be coherent enough to understand and purposeful enough in content for enquiring minds to make use of. 


Trial 1: 

Dosage: approximately 62.5mg ( one portion of eye-balled 8 divisions of 500mg)


Experience: very mild but enjoyable trip, comparable with a lowdose of mushrooms or acid in intensity - say 1-2grams of shrooms or 1 hit of weak lsd.  it took about two hours after dosing to feel what this chemical had to offer.  noteworthy effects after the onset were visual distortions such richer, deeper colours and enhancement of lines on objects for example: faces appeared more defined by wrinkles, marks and such features. During during the peak of the experience (4-6 hours in) some melting/drooping of objects and subtle patterning.

As far as euphoria goes, there was a pleasant buzz throughout comparable with a weed high that gave the experience a positive glow but thoughts remained clear.  Movies were enjoyable and easy to follow,  food tasted excellent.  The next day there was no hangover and I knew that it would take a larger dose of this substance to unlock any profound possibilities this drug has to offer.


Trial 2.0 : 

Dosage: approximately 140 mg Escaline combined with about 100mg of 4-aco-dmt and 10 mgs of ativan. 

Experience: first of all, this trial was an extremely reckless excersize in stupidity that I couldn't recommend with confidence, i've split it up in two parts as it took place over a period of about 20 hours - the second doses of each drug taken about halfway through.  this was a very sloppy trial so specific details are not well defined.  although i haven't experienced any adverse effects other than a difficult trip and a slight hangover the next day,  i recognize the seriousness of not only taking a large dose of research chemicals but combining them is potentially very dangerous.  with that said, i did discover the REAL sweet spot of escaline and my own limits with specifically 4-aco-dmt that i will respect. 


the day started off by taking a conservative dose of 4-aco-dmt (approx 30mg) that i will not trip report as it is irrelevant to the escaline thread.  it was about 4 hours into the initial 4-aco-dmt trip when I decided to redose because the effects were beginning to diminish and I hadn't finished the movie I was watching.  this is where details get fuzzy as I was not recording notes, but I believe at this point i consumed an additional 100 mg of the 4-aco-dmt over the course of about 3 or 4 hours along with about 100mg of the escaline.  


it wasn't until about the 3 or 4 hour point when the the trip got very difficult, it was very frightening.  the nightmare effects were dissociation, confusion, delerium, delusions, paranoia, distracting/obstructive visuals and auditory hallucionations of the persecutory nature (the tv was bad-mouthing me).  once the difficult effects began to take hold, i knew i was in over my head and tried to abort the trip by consuming 10 mgs of ativan to no avail.  i simply lied in bed completely incapacitated for what seemed like an eternity.  at the most intense part of the experience i was certain i had died and was in hell for eternity.  once my awareness started returning bit by bit,  the hell delusion faded away and i thought that i was just an incoherent vegetable - worried that i had lost all control of my body and uncertain of not only my own safety but the safety of others.  although i knew i was in my bed there was a nagging paranoia that my body could very well be wandering around outside my apartment doing god knows what.  


fortunately i had not left my bed,  i had not injured myself or anyone else and after about 4-6 hours the majority of the difficult effects that had sent me to bed wore off.  at this point, i was overcome with relief and a newfound appreciation of life and the psychedelic experience - this was my very first bonified plus four.  i had now seen just how bad it could get and although i'm sure most people would've decided that's enough for the evening, the experience only provoked a kind of confidence in my ability to handle such a rough trip, my curiousity was peaked.  this was shaman territory, i wanted to sail this ship a little further.       


Trial 2.5:

Doseage:  approximately 300 mg Escaline and approx 100mg 4-aco-dmt over a 10ish hour period.

Experience:  very similar to trial 2.0, but the difficult effects were much less pronounced.  the first half of the trial also provided a lot of insight which acted as tools for handling the troubling effects of the second half. to make a long story short, the confusion/delerium aspect of this trip subsided when the 4-aco-dmt wore off about 4 hours after taking what was maybe 100 mg and 4-aco-dmt and let's say 150mg Escaline, so i took an additional 150 mg of the escaline to enhance the tail end of the trip.  this is where i discovered the brilliance such a large dose of escaline provides.  the last 8 hours of this trip were so enjoyable, my visuals were like a cartoon version of reality but thinking was remarkably clear.  there was intense euphoria and stimulation that prompted me to produce music and DJ for hours.  music sounded amazing, i felt more alive than i'd felt in years. i fell asleep before the effects wore off and when i awoke the next day i felt a little off kilter, but nothing a few beers couldn't pacify. 


Conclusion:  Escaline's beauty will not be discovered with conservative doses under the 100mg range.  my first trial of 60ish mg was very uneventful albeit enjoyable.  my second trial ended up being a doseage of 440 mg in total and although it was difficult at times, i attribute the worst effects to combining it with such a large dose of 4-aco-dmt which ended up being an entire 250mg bag over the course of 24 hours.  my instinct is that you can use very high doses (up to 440mg in my experience) of Escaline without severity or unwanted effects so long as you do not combine it with other drugs as i only experienced a mild hangover the next day even with the large dose of 4-aco-dmt factored into the trip.  Don't take my word for it though, i will not be able to confirm this hunch until i am able to trial a large unadulterated Escaline trip - i promise to report my findings as soon as i am able to do some follow up trials.  the immense enjoyability of the final 8 hours of my second trial has convinced me that taking doseages between 100mg - 400mg is a worthwhile endeavour with side effects no worse than a night out on mdma.  thank you for reading, i hope my experiences will help inspire some confidence in apprehensive users of this relatively unexplored compound.


**Moderator warning:** These are incredibly high dosages, please do not attempt something like this. Instead titrate up until you find your sweetspot. ~Jesusgreen

ruder, your doses seems extremely high, a lot of people report getting close to amnesia when getting past the 30 mg of 4-aco-dmt. Do you have experience with different batches? Your stuff might be cut.


Also, do you have a high tolerance to phenethylamines in general? I don't think everybody will get away from taking 300 mg of escaline unscathed.

I think it's the benzos that are accounting for the high doses, I always have to take ridiculously huge doses of psychs if I am on high dose benzos.

Could a low dose of this be nice for going out in a more public setting? A general mood lift and subtle effects.

to address your questions, i do not have a huge tolerance to these types of drugs 

but the first trial of 60mg(ish) dose of escaline two days prior could have contributed to some tolerance in the second trial.  like Jakeperson suggested, the second trial i had also been on ativan all day - probably 15mg in total. 


i should also mention that i wasn't taking large doses of either the aco-dmt or escaline all at once, it was conservative doses taken gradually over the course of about 20 hours for the second trial.  so i think all of these points may explain why i didn't experience side effects such as blackout/amnesia.


what i wanted to stress with my report was that 60mg or less doses of escaline is pretty much a waste of product and i don't imagine 70mg or even 80mg to be much better.  taking 440mg over the course of 20 hours was way too much and i would not repeat the experience, i'm certain it is unnecessary to achieve a strong trip (not to mention dangerous).  with that said, it did prove to me that escaline has the potential for a very potent and enjoyable psychedelic experience with larger doses and has intrigued me enough to follow up with future trials to find that "sweet spot".... *i cannot say the same for 4-aco-dmt, i think i've seen all i want to see with that substance for quite a while - there is nothing left for me to learn about it. * 


my next esc trial is going to be 100mg,  my hunch is that it will be enough to achieve the most desirable effects i remember from my last trip and low enough to maintain some semblance of safety.  i'll let you guys know how it goes.

Thanks for the info regarding your experiences. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I've added a warning to the bottom though given that these dosages are ridiculously high and well beyond any normal range for either substance.


I'd definitely recommend spacing the trips out and dosing less in one go if you want the best effects, it seems like you're using a lot just because you're dosing over a long period of time and because you're tripping rather frequently. I'd give it at least a couple of weeks before your next trial imo ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I tried 50mg of escaline dissolved in some whisky 3 hours after a 20mg dose of 4-ho-met, barely feeled anything. :/


I think the dosage should be more higher.

Well, obviously tolerance to pyches could be an issue! Even following 4-ho-met with Escaline may have coloured the experience. I find that psychedelics are particularly easy to tolerate & sometimes titration doesnt work because each dose is reducing the effectiveness of the next.


Trip reports on new compounds really should be relating to the activity of the new compound alone, not with other psyches involved & with known tolerance issues being brought into the equation!


Posts such as the one Jesus had to edit really could lead someone less experienced into making a very bad mistake!


Go easy with new compounds please people!

Yesterday I received a sample of Escaline sent from Canada. 15mg feels a bit like I'm about to start rolling. A little more alert, a warm feeling and a slight pressure in the head. I will resume the experiment this weekend.


A question for you who's taken larger doses; is this feeling of increased temperature and pressure in the head pronounced at larger doses? Would there be some risk of over heating like with mdma?

i really hope nobody repeats what i did in my second trial, that's not why i posted that report.  i wouldn't recommend anything above 80-100mg for even experienced first time users.  honestly if people read the report i made it very clear that the experience was a mistake despite any lessons learned.  if people take anything from the report it should be to not mix sedatives such as benzos with their research because it can lead to foolish decisions like redosing. 


80mg should be enough to get your feet wet without feeling like you wasted your stock.

I recently tried a higher dosage than my previous (first time was 75mg). This time I liquid dosed 125mg.  Again, still less than a full out psychedelic trip, reminiscent of a low dose mushroom trip with faint patterning just emerging on surfaces.  The HUGE difference this time was instead of feeling depersonalized and dumbed down, I was way more active in conversation, made connections easily and was "mostly" able to communicate points with a sober (well, cocaine using) individual.  I suffered from tangential talking in that the the longer I spent making a point, the more convoluted and disconnected my thoughts became, but my friend knows me well and was able to construct the salient concepts. This happens to me all the time on psychedelics so no surprise there.  Higher amounts of discomfort on the come up, but traded off for stronger euphoria and some very pretty visual distortion of art, pictures etc.  Spent a LONG time watching Milkdrop for Winamp.  All in all, still not where I want, still comfortable enough that I'm going to keep upping the dosage (I can't shake the feeling that the visuals will get stronger with more). I sweat like crazy but my friend has his thermostat up mega high so that happens at his place even when I'm sober, by the end of the trip I had some muscle tension going on in my shoulders and neck and I had tremors the whole duration (I also don't eat for 12 hours before psychedelics to increase onset and reduce GI issues during the come up, I once had 6 grams of mushrooms take 5 hours to hit me after a large dinner).


Vibra, to answer your question, I think that you will find the overheating to be generally similar at higher dosages to lower dosages.  I would try and put yourself in a situation where you can alter the temperature easily (walk outside, open a window, etc) as I found cool air made the problem go away completely.  I don't really know about the head pressure, there is some weird stuffy feeling but I get that with all psychedelics. It was present but not worse at either dose. Given that I don't eat and that I never really felt the urge to drink until I started getting some weird effects too late in the trip to be the drug, I would NOT use this in a 100mg dose or higher at a rave or anything.  Probably safe but I managed to dehydrate myself sitting on a couch, so I would err on the side of caution (at least till more reports come out).


Phsycodelic - I found this easier anxiety wise than any psychedelic I've ever taken.  It has an energy component to it that might leave you feeling restless and not quite sure what to do with it, but in terms of any kind of worries or negative thoughts or paranoia (I'm never going to be sober again or I'm destroying the universe with my mind kind of thing) I found it to be completely peaceful, the strength of it comes and goes in waves too I find, so if you are in a too intense moment, it won't last too long before you are feeling more normal.

Any one can compare allylescaline to escaline? They sound very similar. Can't really make up my mind if I'm bothered to spend money on this. Allylescaline was actually an allright compound, but it's not something I'm going to be taking very often.

from what i gather escaline is better than allyescaline just by reading reviews but i haven't tried ally yet. Going to try proscaline tonight, not expecting much but hopefully it's fun.


as for not getting anything from doses under 100mg, i'd really have to question your vendor or your tolerance, 70-80mg was strong enough for me, then again i dont' take 10mg of ativan when i trip either so you probably just wasted ur escaline doing that. Even with a tolerance i didn't venture over 100mg at a time, i don't think it'd get any more interesting at 140 compared to 100. Either way, dose low, not many people have played with it yet, no sense in risking a possible death or some shit from pushing it.

Well, I actually think they sound very similar from descriptions, same degree of visuals, Escaline maybe sounds a bit more peaceful, but with more side effects a la overheating...? I'd imagine that Escalines color scheme is more similar to mescaline. I think that AL's colors were very lush in my opinion. Quite special.


allylescaline actually does sound more potent by weight on the other hand. I think people were so disppointed by AL because it was kind of hyped up just before, while E seems to just have made an unseeming quiet entrance to the stage.


Anyway they're surely bound to very similar, so I'd love to hear a first hand comparison.

On the one hand, I understand that this is a compound that very few people have reported on, and thus, pushing too high to fast may come with certain additional and unknown risk.  On the other hand, I could see how the same argument towards "taking more wont be likely to get you any further" obfuscating the potential of a substance.  It is unfortunate that often people inadvertantly cause themselves injury or death in finding the sweet spot between effects and side-effects.  


That said, I'm sure if LSD were not a known substance, and you were one of the first people taking it, and you took 100 to 150 mcgs, you could make the exact same argument and never find that at 250mcg to 400mcg+, the whole game changes.  This is evidenced with a lot of Mescaline reports too, in which its all lighthearted fun and "nowhere near a full blown psychedelic" until that magic threshold is reached and then it becomes visionary medicine. My personal experience with Methylone follows similar where 100mgs was ok, but only once I read that 300mgs was generally tolerated well did I finally realize that it was a totally worthwhile substance.


I don't feel yet that my side-effects significantly increased to the point of concern or that I was pushing my boundaries in that way and I will continue to try escalating dosages probably up to the 200mg mark.  I ~REALLY REALLY REALLY~ highly endorse that anyone who gets this chemical obviously do an allergy test and also starts in the 70mg or less range "if" they are sure they have what they bought. Just in case it was missed above, I'm pretty experienced and I weigh 240 pounds.  I got more out of it visually at 125 than 100 and 75, and if the trend continues, it may end up being a really expensive full on trip.  As a final note, I'm not a teenager hiding my use of this in my basement bedroom or whatnot, I'm taking it with a sitter at a house 5 minutes away from a hospital (with a cardiac center) and my sitter has benzos on hand and information to tell paramedics if I start seizing or stop breathing or whatnot.  Am I taking a risk, absolutely, but hopefully one well mitigated by many factors (and hopefully one of those factors being a large therapeutic index for Escaline).

I tried escaline about a week ago. I tried snorting about 5 mg to see if it burned. Some burning, nothing too serious. I swallowed the other 45 mg of the 50 mg dose I weighed out. I started feeling some effects within about 1/2 hour, probably from the nasal dose. The main onset took about 90 minutes. There was some slight nausea but nothing like 2cX or NBOMEs or AL. I felt quite bad from just a small dose of Al that I tried a few months ago, only about 10 mg. Never tried it again after that cuz I didn't like it at all. The escaline was definitely better than that. 


I had a nice controllable high from the 50 mg. I was able to eat during it but hunger was reduced. I ate a ginger cookie early on when I first started feeling the slight nausea. It may have helped, hard to tell but I didn't feel too bad stomach-wise during the trip. It had an erotic component to it. Didn't cause my nutsack to retract or anything. All was well downstairs and I was feeling pretty good all around with heightened sexual feelings. 


At the peak I did start to get on the verge of reality starting to slip away and going into the psyche zone, but I was able to hold it together and maintain my grasp on reality by simply opening my eyes. With eyes closed I tended to start drifting from reality. I don't think I would want to take more than 50 or maybe 60 mg though or I might psyche out too far. It didn't really last a full 12 hours from onset, more like 8-9, a good duration. I was then able to go to sleep with no problem and no dream disturbances or anything like that. No noticeable hangover effect either.


Visuals were nothing special, some closed eye stuff, patterning and such, open eye halos and waviness. Nothing too serious. It was a pretty good experience altogether, except the noticeable light nausea the first few hours which was irritating. Maybe pretreatment with several ginger cookies would improve that. I didn't really feel like eating more than 1 or 2 cookies after the nausea started. I intended to eat 2 but I could only eat one, I think it helped some though. 


This was actually the best of all the PEAs I've tried so far. Pleasant but not extreme. If there was no nausea at all it would be perfect but even so it wasn't all that bad. Regarding snorting, I definitely wouldn't want to snort a whole 50-60 mg dose cuz that's a lot of powder. I just dropped it onto my tongue and drank some water to wash it down. No objectionable taste really, just some bitter mediciney taste.


Forgot to mention that there was some tremors. Nothing major and not as bad as other PEAs, tryptamines and NBOMEs but still noticeable tremors like in the back of the thighs mainly. I guess there's no way around some tremors and nausea with PEAs. Still at least at the small dose of 50 mg the tremors and nausea were not really that objectionable. It wasn't like I took some earthquake pills like Wile E Coyote in the Roadrunner cartoons like it was with the other compounds I mentioned.

If I want to combine escaline with proscaline, should I treat it like the 2c-x's and scale down the dose of each? I expect them to potentiate each other quite a bit. I am thinking of doing a 30mg dose of each as a first trial.

**SSRI + Escaline = bogus deal**


for the past two weeks i've been taking Sertraline (Zoloft) and decided i would like to try a trial of Escaline at 100mg.  i'm disappointed to report that it does not work!  i experienced intense nausea on the come-up to which i was left no choice but to purge within the first hour of dosing.  for the first four hours it felt as if i was on the verge of breaking through to a trip but it never got there.  i experienced close to zero beneficial psychedelic effects the entire "trip", it was less intense than my 60mg dose two weeks prior.  it felt like i had a flu for the entire evening (head pressure and sinus/chest congestion, chills and general malaise) - the bodyload was oddly much more uncomfortable than my +200mg experience. 


now i'm not certain if the reason my experience was so weak because of purging, or if it was due to the SSRI's - but the uncomfortable physical effects were so much stronger than my previous experiences, which leads me to believe i must have absorbed most of the chemical. my conclusion is that SSRI's either dull the experience and/or intensify ucomfortable bodyload, neither of which are desirable outcomes.  


i advise people who are being treated with SSRI's to avoid Escaline.

Maybe shouldn't be posting here on a combo, don't want to overly confuse the thread but 60mg 4-AcO-DMT with 30mg Escaline, further 30mg Escaline about two-three hours in produced super-interesting, intense effects. I think it's fair to say I got Mescaline ( or something very like what I imagine it to be ) at last. I expected the Psilocin to be the dominant thing, you'd expect so given the dosing, surely, but not at all. Wow, what a ride. Super-dissociative, I didn't expect that, was well out of body ( you know what I mean. Not really but feels OOBE same enough. ) for long periods, took a while to get back, infinite regress. Foolish really but thought safe to push. Was very good in all, would recommend at sensible doses. Escaline is what it says it is on the tin AFAICPossiblyImagine, no question, can see exactly where all the archetypal mescaline stuff comes from. At last.


Very, very far from anything even remotely rational for a time as things peaked, million possible positions all intensely experienced starting with being / none-being and working all the way out from there and back again through the psyche. Car crash territory if out in public, straight locked up for your own protection, poss. sectioned, WTF have you done to yourself you lunatic and no two ways about it. I was able to take a step far enough back as a passive observer along for the ride, do what was needed to ride the turbulence out before engaging more actively with it, there was still enough control there but only just really. Soon as I'd chilled back a bit was very, very good peak, dead euphoric, super visual, couldn't see for shit OEV, patterns on patterns endlessly, CEVs amazing, beautiful, complex geometry. Outstanding stuff.


Taken aback how strong it was, was hoping the 4-AcO would be enough to defeat tolerance enough for a trip, had it before at doses up to 60mg on its own and a good ++/+++ at that but hardly intense or demanding. Can't understand how the Escaline had such a dramatic added effect at that dose, especially when a larger dose only a few days back did next to nothing. Never experienced anything like it with mushrooms alone, 40g of good fresh Cubes was a regular thing back when I could still buy them legally UK, this was radically different. Will have to play with Escaline some more but I don't think that would do it on its own either, some synergy going on here I think. Will have to work back a little to find a sweetspot for it but will def do again, lot of potential. The Escaline's just recently come available is a winner, happy days.

Just wanted to say I took a 200mg dose of Escaline as I truly felt it had more to offer than at the 125mg point (which had more to offer than the 75mg point) and can say without a doubt that it is capable of the full blown psychedelic trip.  It was overly stimulating at that dose and I wasn't able to learn much from the trip, but again, it left my psyche pretty much intact and I don't see people freaking out on it.  I probably won't do it again, but it was worth the price of admission (cost wise and toll on my body) for the experience.  I posted a full report in the TR section.

Does someone tried Proscaline here ? How could they compare with Escaline ?


Any ideas for a treshold dose ?


Thank you !

60mg bombed and 20mg railed gave a good, soft on the vitals, but deep ride. combines wonderfully with K. will be done again. the afterglow is pretty long and enduring, yet not uncomfortable. just be prepared not to sleep for a bit after this journey.

I think it's fair to say I got Mescaline ( or something very like what I imagine it to be ) at last. I expected the Psilocin to be the dominant thing, you'd expect so given the dosing, surely, but not at all. Wow, what a ride. Super-dissociative, I didn't expect that, was well out of body ( you know what I mean. Not really but feels OOBE same enough. ) for long periods, took a while to get back, infinite regress. Foolish really but thought safe to push. Was very good in all, would recommend at sensible doses. Escaline is what it says it is on the tin AFAICPossiblyImagine, no question, can see exactly where all the archetypal mescaline stuff comes from. At last.

Car crash territory if out in public, straight locked up for your own protection, poss. sectioned, WTF have you done to yourself you lunatic and no two ways about it. I was able to take a step far enough back as a passive observer along for the ride, do what was needed to ride the turbulence out before engaging more actively with it, there was still enough control there but only just really. Soon as I'd chilled back a bit was very, very good peak, dead euphoric, super visual, couldn't see for shit OEV, patterns on patterns endlessly, CEVs amazing, beautiful, complex geometry. Outstanding stuff.

Can't understand how the Escaline had such a dramatic added effect at that dose, especially when a larger dose only a few days back did next to nothing. Never experienced anything like it with mushrooms alone, 40g of good fresh Cubes was a regular thing back when I could still buy them legally UK, this was radically different. Will have to play with Escaline some more but I don't think that would do it on its own either, some synergy going on here I think. Will have to work back a little to find a sweetspot for it but will def do again, lot of potential. The Escaline's just recently come available is a winner, happy days.

Hi Sepher, 


I completely agree that there is some kind of very special synergy that goes on between Escaline and 4-AcO-DMT. I will post a more complete trip report when I have time. But here is a quick summary of the most intense part of the experience along with the rough timeline. 


t=0 hours 70 mg Escaline taken orally

t=2 hours 35 mg Escaline taken orally

t=4 hours 24 mg of 4-AcO-DMT (fumarate salt) taken orally

t=5.5 hours I went from a gentle ++ to a nearly full blown experience that was very akin to a good, nearly crossing over experience produced by DMT. To be clear, I didn't take any DMT that night, but the experience was so overwhelming that this seems like the best way to describe it. Everything turned bright yellow/orange and I could no longer see the people around me, just humanoid shapes for a few minutes, then nothing but geometric patterns. I couldn't walk. Well, maybe I could have, but I would not have known which direction I was going (straight, left, up or down, I don't know). But unlike DMT, I knew who I was, where I was and I knew what was going on, for the most part. I've done a lot of combo's in the past, but nothing prepared me for this. This was crazy. The very fast onset, and intensity of the peak and the brevity of that part of the trip. It lasted only about 15 minutes. I was really pretty scared for those 15 minutes, since I didn't know where the plateau would be. I taken so off guard by the speed of the onset and the intensity. In retrospect, I am really glad that I had previous experience with DMT, it put my mind at ease, a little. 


So a word of warning, watch out for this combination, I really think that there is something very special and possibly dangerous about this combination. 


The materials in question were weighed out accurately and characterized personally via proton NMR.

I tried escaline twice last week at 62.5 mg per dose and was profoundly unimpressed.  I now have much less of a desire to try mescaline than before.  No visuals, no psychedelia just uncomfortable stimulation that had me munching on temazepam.

Having both tried escaline and mescaline, I can tell you the the two have, besides a similar chemical structure,, almost nothing in common..

Took 100mg of this stuff about 2 and half hours ago, so far not impressed. Strong come up nausea, which immediately receded after puking. I'm getting minor visuals, a slight tingly body sensations, and minor music enhancement. Pretty disappointed so far.

Haha i've done mescaline a few times, it was a lot more interesting than this. I'm at hour 4 now and it's still extremely underwhelming. I don't think it would worth pushing a higher dose for me because the come up nausea was intense, even after having taken 12mg of ondansetron. Mescaline had far more pronounced effects.

For those who have tried escaline... is it something which you can take in a small dose and still be able to interact with people and go about your life without it being obvious you are on drugs?

I don't think there is any drug which you can't do that with, assuming the dose is low enough.


I assume that like with most psychedelics, the only things visible on the outside are manifestations of behavioural changes, so if you take a lowish dose then I expect you could hide this. Of course, it's horrible to have to hide that you are tripping so I would advise against it.

This is true. I'm wondering whether it's possible with a low dose that is still high enough to be worth doing and you still get the changed perception and feelings of euphoria without losing the ability to form sentences coherently or walk properley. And what about those guys that have done normal doses like 50-70mg? Did you face any social interaction? Is it an absolute no-no to go into college for example? I ask because right now I am experimenting with drugs to see how it changes the way I perceive things I do in my daily routine, like lectures and classes. I have ADD and an hour long class drives me crazy. Off course I'm not intending to use a drug like escaline daily to deal with ADD, literally just experimenting

I have yet to try Escaline, i have done Allylescaline from 10mg, to almost over 100mg, actually over 100mg, it's quite fun to party on at concerts and music festivals. It's really easy going and much better than mdma, no gurning a lot of music synesthesia especially at high doses.SQUAREPUSHER Broke my mind that is all i have to say.

I put allylescaline into the same category as MDMA//Low dose mescaline, at almost any dose it's an Entactogen, it doesn't really "do" much. But neither does mescaline until you consume like half a gram, IF not more. That is when the magic happens with mescaline. I thought personally the 2c's were shulgins way of making mescaline more potent, or at least various feeling from within the confines of a traditional mescaline experience. I've always thought the 2c's to be the Onion of mescaline. Each 2c' is a layer. Each one has the abilty to take you to the absolute most deepest possible layer, of a mescaline trip. A Mescaline trip, can be any 2c' sometimes, it feels interchangeable depending on set, setting, dose, mind set. I've found each 2c to be incredibly distinct. I've found mescaline to be an extremely variable and incredibly powerful god headed entheogen. It's closer to 2c-e and MDMA than lets say 2c-i at the higher dose range. 

So the jury is in.

Escaline is weak.

Proscaline sucks.

Allylescaline, isn't really worth exploring, it's party stuff, i'm actually surprised it didn't take over after the mephedrone ban lol.

MAL: Methallylescaline very little reviews, and i want to know more before i do it. I'm very interested.


hmm i wonder where we will go next.

Well my order for Escaline came today so I decided to plug 30mgs, however... My original plans were to take a 6-apb/5-meo-mipt/4-ho-met combo which is what I did so my experience is "tainted" I guess. I started the morning by ingesting 140mgs of 6-apb with 35mgs of Metocin rectally, I then went on to smoke/plug about 20mgs of Moxy... the experience that ensued was breathtaking, really it was a beautiful experience with full on auditory hallucinations but that's irrelevent to this thread. Well as I was coming down from this trip I was surprised to see that my order for Escaline arrived. 


I know it's unwise to combo with any new drugs but since I was approaching baseline from the other psychs  (sans the 6-apb, that was still going along) and I was eager to try Escaline as it's my first experience with a mescaline analog I decided to see how active this stuff would be rectally so I plugged 30mgs. That was about one hour and 15 mins ago and I'll say that it's very pleasant so far. Zero bodyload and quite visual at this dose, I think I'll stick to rectal after giving oral a shot once to see if any elements are missing with the rectal experience. First alerts were felt about 30 or so mins, has a definate mescaline vibe but also quite unique, it's early to tell but the visuals so far are unique to any other psych though unfortunately that could be from the 6-apb. There is also a huge marked increase in euphoria. 


I'll write a summary when the experience is over and have plans to ingest only Escaline next weekend in which I will also summarize. I have a hard time putting my trips into words which is why I won't write a full TR but I'll be sure to give a decent overview since there's so little info on this stuff.

First things first sorry for not following up on that last post, been of bl for a bit and forgot about this post, anywhoo... not much progressed after that post. It was an okay experience but according to my most recent escaline experience it seems that not only was 30mgs an bit of an underdose but that oral works best with this stuff so with not much to be said about this trip I'll move on.


Well I had another go with this stuff at 70mgs and this stuff is quite nice. This time though it didn't really feel like mescaline at all, in fact I couldn't really find another psych to comfortably draw any significant similarities...truely unique but I've still got some trials to run. I'm not sure what the deal was but this time this stuff took almost 4 hours to fully lift off, maybe more. I felt first alerts at about 1 1/2 hours and effects slowly climbed until the 3 1/2 hour point which comprised of a semi-stimmy, but also cozy euphoria with some pretty decent and unique visuals. They were very chaotic and colorful, though were very far from what I would call the usual 'cathedral' like visuals I get from ALOT of phens. There was no structure to the visual insanity (by insanity I mean the rapid shifting of the patterns, not the intensity though they were very much apparent).


Not much with eyes closed but was surprised what open eyes had to offer after reading how this one was labeled as one of the "not so visual" psychedelics. I do tend to be a bit of an oddball when it comes to psychs I find visual though. For example mushrooms, which for many are considered moderately to highly visual are pretty much the opposite for me but I get decent visuals from substances like aMT, 5-meo-mipt, and even the APB's...well at least compared to most.


Anyways at the 4h mark I thought things were as strong as they were gonna get and I would've like a bit more (yeah, I was being greedy ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)) so I plugged a small 5mg dose of 5-meo-mipt and IDK if the escaline hadn't truely kicked in all the way or the moxy was just the perrfect fit to the psychedelic puzzle but 30mins after this I was left in a hilarity filled stupor with some of the strongest visuals I've had in a LONG time! I could only explain it as watching my visual field just collapse in itself. Everything blended to the point where my visual field was one object with no borders and lots of rapid moving patterns. If I abstained from blinking the merging of my vision would become so intense I thought I was just gonna start seizing, my visual process was demolished into nothing more than a psychedelic gravy.


When looking in the mirror I experienced the most significant facial morphing to date. It would start with textbook alex gray vision accross my face but if I continued to stare without blinking my face re-arranged into so many different forms at such rapid succesion that it was like my facial recognition process was completely destroyed. Eyes melting off the sides of my face while my forhead was split open to reveal a series of 3 noses which would collapse into itself... well i could go on forever at just how fucking entertaining this was, in all my years of tripping I never though the mirror visuals could get to the level of intensity it was on this trip. This peak lasted for about 3 hours but there was such significant time dilation that it felt like way longer. The trip was baselined at about the 9 hour mark but there was a two hour period of slight residual stimulation. 


I only have about 2 more doses of the stuff and while I will most definately be taking moxy with one of these doses I wanna see exactly how much the moxy added to this experience so for my next run with the escaline there will be no 'contaminants'. Being that 5mgs of rectal moxy alone would provide nothing more than a nice euphoria and very weak visuals there was either some serious potentiation, the escaline didn't truely peak when I though it had, or both but man were the visuals something else. 


As for headspace, meh it was extremely clearheaded and quite boring when it comes to mental exploration with the exception of a 30min period where I was able to gain a fresh perspective on who I am as a person but as soon as the self analyzation began it ended so I think this ones gonna go into the recreational bin. The visual activity to mind effect ratio was totally skewed to the former which was kinda dissapointing but not completely, the experience was still pretty damn awesome. That's all I have to add for now but will continue to post about any upcoming escaline adventures being that so little info is to be found on this one but being that I react to substances quite uniquely I wouldn't use my experiences as something to base your standards on.


Edit: I forgot to add, escaline has proved to carry absolutely no bodyload for me. No nausea, temp fluctuations, stiff muscles...nada. was expecting a somewhat similar bodyload to mescaline but this stuff didn't *feel* toxic in the least

That sounds like good news, though your admitted tendency to idiosyncratic reactions to psychedelics still leaves room for error. I got distracted by LSz & Al-Lad last year, & thus my experiments with Escaline were cut short. I had an interesting threshold experience on 25mg in early last summer. The mild trip was nothing to write home about though some brief notes were made. I intended & still intend upping the dose to 40mg as I've heard it said this is in fact a threshold dose. I'm ultra-sensitive to psyches so I go easy to start with.


Your report of unique effects is intriguing but it's slightly unfortunate that you added another drug to the mix as it would be interesting to get a full report on Escaline itself, but this isn't a critiscm, just a comment. Thanks for the heads-up, I'm going to have to head back into Escaline-space again soon.

My one experience with Escaline (it was awhile ago but it was somewhere from 80-100mg) was terrible and totally worthless. A rampant and severe nausea was produced that lasted for 3 hours, with virtually no psychedelic effects. The faintest breathing/blurring of edges and a music enhancement that was much less impressive than that of cannabis was all I got. Maybe I got poor quality Escaline but the vendor was pretty great and I got awesome quality 4-sub tryptamines from him, so I dunno. I would never touch it again after that though - it certainly was nothing like the magic of a good mescaline experience.

^ Wow dude that sucks. Reports on this one seem to be a bit jumbled, though that's likely because there's so little to go off of. What I do know is that my experience totally caught me by surprise... I mean before I took the 5-meo-mipt the experience was okay, but nothing special. I feel kinda dumb for adding the Moxy at the 4th hour  I should've just ran the trips course and once the effects are approaching baseline vape 10mgs (for the past few months I've been using small doses of moxy to flavor my trips as I find it makes for a fantastic additive that usually doesn't change the experience much). 


As for the bodyload I was definately expecting something fierce but it was beyond smooth. It's worth mentioning though that with the exception of 2c-e and mescaline, no phen has ever made me nauseous... weird huh being that phens seem to have a tendency to tear peoples guts up but I've even taken insane 2c-i doses which seems to cause bodyload in my circle and experience nothing except stimulation if that counts as bodyload.

Yeah my experience was definately unique but as mentioned it's hard to tell being that I added the moxy which I shouldn't have. All reports seem to describe full effects by around the 3 hour point so I figured that a psych that usually lasts about 10 hours should definately be up by 4 hours so who knows, it's likely that the experience 'pre-moxy' was indeed as strong as it's gonna get. If that's the case then I would give the experience a C+. It was pretty fun, lighthearded and decently visual with no bodyload so I would have no qualms upping the dose to maybe 80-90 mgs and see what else it's got to offer. 


It was certainly nothing spectacular (though far from un-pleasant, talking pre-moxy here) or magical but then again I don't find alot of psychs magical either (mescaline included, seems really recreational to me), I seem to be somewhat resilient to strong mindfuck. Mushrooms, LSD, and maybe miprocin, and 2c-e seem to be the only psychs that really have strong effects on thoughts so I usually tend to push things a bit. 


Before escaline I was trying to push DOC being that It's always being praied but I've tried it now about 3-4x ranging from 3mgs oral to 6mgs plugged and have found the experience extremely shallow and translucent on the body as far as any bodyload and euphoria every time...just feels like a long lasting, dragging 2c-c trip with major visuals, not to mention incredibly sedating ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) (yup, sedation from DOC... told ya I'm weird). There are quite a few other substances that seem to not really knock me silly but no time to elaborate, I just felt my reaction to DOC seems to be one of the more unique ones. I guess I'm special ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png).


PS: I got to thinking and realized that my scales may be a bit off so it's possible that what I plugged was more than 5mgs... I guess I'll never know now, I will say that either the moxy took the back seat and intensified the escaline or the two created a new experience through synergy but It certainly felt nothing like moxy alone.

----------

Update: Okay so I'm not gonna bump this but I recently found out some asshole I know slipped 2mgs of DOC into my gatorade (a popular sports drink in america for those who don't know) prior to ingestion of the escaline so I think that just about solves why I got so loaded on average doses of both moxy and escaline. In other words, once again this report is useless ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)… Don't worry, I slapped this asshat silly and let him know the possibility of vasoconstriction with this combo.

There seems to be little information regarding dosages for this one. I really think 60mgs is my sweet spot as 80mgs felt very hard on my heart. I puked 2 out of the 3 times I've used it and honestly I felt a lot better after the purge. This is about 80% as enjoyable as mescaline imho with about the same amount of nausea/bodyload making it a keeper in my book. Mixing with a 4-subbed-tryptamine makes for a pretty memorable experience.

]^Yeah, the first time I used 50mgs/80mgs I made sure to eat several hours beforehand and after purging I had great times. The second time I tried 80mgs it was on an empty stomach and though I never actually puked I felt much sicker for the second half of the trip.

Be careful and have fun man. Not to sound weird but you're one of the few BLer's I actually actively worry about and this one does feel dangerous at 80mgs. It had a lingering residual stimulation and irregular heartbeat that was much similar to when i went to the hospital for insufflating +5mgs of 25B. It was really nice at  50mg aside from the G.I. distress up until the purge. It did go great with mxe and made epic hole for an all around awesome night. I don't know how size would factor in but I'm 5'11 145 pounds and I won't be comfortable taking moore than 70mgs. Lastly, take it early in the day as the duration is quite long, right up there with doc iirc.

Do you think escaline and DOC would play well together? Is it a quick purge, or does the feeling persist for a while until an hour or two passes when, finally, it arrives?

I think that Escaline and DOC are so close in effect that it wouldn't make sense to combine these to, just take a larger dose of one of them instead. 

And I never had to purge on this, so can't comment on that.

Well, took about 100mg escaline with 20mg 3 meo PCP Sunday, had a blast.


It seemed kind of like a lush, sparkly, dream. Took 30-35mg around 11am with 10mg 3 meo PCP at 10am. Around 1230pm took 65 mg escaline, all orally.


For the first two hours I felt a slight nasuea building. Like something rolling around in my stomach that needed to be purged. I was at a theme park riding roller coasters, so this was a tricky situation.


I went into the bathroom with the intention to make myself puke like 10 times. Just couldn't do it with all the people around. I was tripping and felt awkward. It was kind of horrible really.


It was like waves of nausea and intense pleasure. Like, it was toooo intense of a mind fuck, but I was still tripping pretty hard. Kinda hard to explain.


Probably about 3-330pm I felt the nausea start to settle into my digestive track. I dunno I puking would have helped at this point... I just felt it working through my body, kinda sucked. Didn't shit until Tuesday, and I usually go once or twice a day at least.


Didn't piss until about 5pm. Went once more before 10pm. Its like the escaline shut down everything but the desire to puke. I think if I would have puked everything would have been perfect.


Main effects peaked around 5-6pm. Felt small waves come Nd go until about 10. Redosed 10mg 3 meo pcp around 5pm. Vapedsome shatter mix continuously through the day. Still felt it when I went to sleep around 330am. Took 3mg etizolam and knocked out.


Got up at 9am. Worked all day and felt like shit. Kinda like I was still tripping half the day. Wonder how much was BC I didn't throw up and couldn't shit for two days.


Still had an awesome time though. Would definatly plug it next time. Probably fast the day before and eat nothing day of trip til 5-6hours in. Could dose higher, or dose lower. I think both would be enjoyable. For some reason I really like this chemical so far.

I wonder if the dissociation from the 3-meo-pcp made it harder to really connect with the needed puking or shitting to get the job done? I've never tried that one so I don't really know what it's like.

I would walk into the bathroom, go into a stall, and could focus on nothing else but all the other people milling about. Had this fear of someone asking me if I was okay while trying to puke and getting in trouble for all the drugs I had. I don't think the 3 meo was the problem.


I know I focused on the bad, more to say than the good I guess. I would take it again for the exact same experience honestly. There was just something beautiful and magical in a clear headedish way about escalne

I cant say there were any outright visuals (I usually don't get much in the way of OEV, CEV is another story.


I was at a theme park, lots of bright colors. I want to use the word "pastel" for some reason, dunno why. Everything looked super bright and awesome. Like a sparkly dream. A tinge of wonder emanating from all. I don't know a better way to describe it tho. 


Guy I got it from said it shined for him at 170. I physically didn't feel any symptoms that would keep me from doing 150 next time. I also think I could take 60 and have fun. Probably not lower than that. I also have tripped on average 1x a week this year. Also am usually a "hard head" with most substances/doses...YMMV


Cant Wai to try it again!

Tried 60mg plugged this time. Wrapped in thin TP and inserted directly following bowel movement.


No real noticeable increase in come up time. 2.5-3 hours or so. Absolutely no nausea though. Ate breakfast, and ate while in it. Huge difference from my 100mg oral experience two weeks ago.


 not much difference in potency though. I expected the 60mg plugged to he equal to 100mg oral. Nope. I also tripped last Friday and Saturday, that probably didn't help much.


I took 15mg 3 meo PCP hour prior to dosing escaline. Another 15mg about 5 hours in. Probably coulda gone with 10 both times. Another two 15mg doses about 10 and 11 hours in. This thing LAST FOREVER. Took at 930am and 230am I am meditating on the porch smoking weed still tripping.


I like it much better plugged. No nausea. I think 100mg is the lowest I would really wanna take. Can still pass for sober fairly easy, say compared to 3 hits LSD. I think I would like to try 135-160mg dose next time. I think that could get a bit intense though.


Seem to have a bit of a hangover the next day.

Tasted this one for the first time today at 100 mg oral

Fun but underwhelming

The bodyload was much less than expected which was merciful, I just threw up once then felt better after (usually if I purge during a trip I feel bad the whole rest of the trip)

Stimulating and mentally interesting but lacking strong sensory effects

My impression is that other drugs do what this one does better, the value was just in the novelty

Only other mesc analogues ive done are methallylescaline and allylescaline, methallyl was brutal on my body but a very powerful and interesting experirence, allylescaline was very mild and was just a gentle high, this falls somewhere in between.


I'll have a full report in  a week or so.

Thank you for the update **Nervewing**! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Never got to try this one as I opted out for Proscaline and 3C-P instead, perhaps Escaline would be a good addition to ETH-LAD?..8)

Thank you for this report, Nervewing.


Do you think it would be more rewarding if you up the dose more than 100mg oral?

I had a great experience on proscaline recently, highly situational in nature but quite wonderful.  Can I ask you guys who have escaline, what does it look like?  My proscaline is shiny, flaky crystals, like flakes of crystal and shimmer in the light.  My escaline, which showed up in GC/MS as containing a variety of (unknown) things along with escaline, is a chalky nondescript white powder.  Wondering what it's supposed to look like.

My Escaline and Proscaline are are both flaking shiny clear/white crystal...mine are some of the nicest looking RC I've ever acquired. 

Flaky large clear/white crystal shards along with some fine powder (ground up crystal) and the powder itself shimmers in the light  (grinds up into very fine crystal).

Damn I might have to bust ny escaline out of cold storage to give a viewpoint. I think I have about half a g left. I really like this one for some reason. I think maybe I would like MAL as much, maybe more, and I would still really like to try tma-6 again.

It sounds like your Escaline is cut with something based on your description of it...

I would consider doing a solvent wash to see how much your left with after washing it.

I'd be concerned taking it considering that Escaline is known for producing nausea on its own and who knows what it's cut with or what precursors ate left in it.

I'll stick this hear since it's not an outstanding TR:


I had done a good deal of research as to what my dose should be; in the end what I had weighted 80mg so that ended any further indecision on the matter and I took it 8.40am and felt it in 20-30minutes and by 45-50minutes my tongue was numb there was some head space and something slight in the vision. I lay in bed and read getting fair obviously intoxicated. It got a hard-serious feel and there is gut disturbance but to my surprise no nausea. From 11 or so it’s opening up a bit more and the visual element is coming to play but there is no heightening of colours. We find a Dog vomit slime mould in the garden and ID and do some research on it and other topics

12.40(3hrs) Sit out in the garden – seen things moving slightly but easily ignored – I’m not totally comfortable – tight, tense – not too bad but not restful. Bit mashed and feels hard. 

We chat about politics then I start training the dog teaching her to roll it down the hill to me which is fun.

1.30 I notice the bodyload again – just a bit heavy prickly. Do some bit’s inside – it’s thoughtful – not neutral in that odd +/- 2C-E way but level/serious maybe even introverted and the bodyload eases off. One can enjoy this but it doesn’t push off in that direction on it’s own too much.

For the rest of the day there are waves of stimulation alternating with more comfortable phases. The only side effect is the continued gastric disturbance with some twitchiness and looseness in the bowel. I read more a lot more which is very engaging and letter sdon’t seem to swim whilst engaged in the activity. I try some music which sounds good. Later a walk out (hr 7.5-8.5hrs) feels mildly trippy. In fact its been pretty even for hours – the down slope is incredibly slow.

Escaline is the first 3,4,5 PEA substitution I’ve tried feels very different to the warm colourful 2C’s – it’s not entirely comfortable but could be quite interesting (at higher dose) and it’s more anorexic than average. there was another wave of stimulation around 10 hours and as with Shulgins dosage which is somewhat low (in fairness he differentiates sulphate/hcl  however much difference that makes) so is his duration optimistic – this peters out rather slowly – it was terminated with benzo but likely the duration was over 15hrs.

Never had much luck with escaline for some reason. Tried it from two different sources and mainly felt a pleasant but jittery body euphoria and mild tracers. Nothing like mescaline or any of the 2c family I have tried. It does have a cool effect on music though.

I dont know why people generally have such cold attitude towards this chem, but it was a love at the first "sight" for me! 8)


I have tried it for the first time few weeks ago and man, it's an awesome chem! 

Escaline is the best of all the xscalines I've tried and the closest to true Mescaline. When I say "best" I measure it with the "WOW!" factor and how I felt after the trip. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)


I took 46mg as my first dose after trying minuscule amounts (1-3mg) of it a day before to see if I have any allergic response or in case if it would turn out to be a different chemical.


The substance looks as scaly yellowish crystals, taste "phenethylaminic" bitter.


Had a medium breakfast two and a half hours before taking it and in retrospect it could have been the reason for slight nausea I had while coming up. Validol and breathing menthol oil vapors helped with it and I did not have to resort to taking Ondansetron (although most likely I will preload with it if taking double the amount of Escaline).


Started to feel effects in about 30-40 minutes - typical phenethylamine slow come up with some nausea and body tenseness. Coming up continued for another hour and by two hours I started slowly peaking. 

Thats when I felt safe to take 20mg of 4-HO-EPT. The reason behind this addition is my phenomenally good experience of mixing it with Mescaline (cactus extract HCL). 4-HO-EPT went like bread and butter with Escaline! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


I peaked at about 3 hours into a beautiful serene and very positive mindset, felt stimulated and motivated. Too bad I was staying in and the weather outside was terrible for walking. Escaline is perfect for long hikes IMO - energetic, springy, made me feel like a kid again! :D


The peak with Escaline is similar to Mescaline - looong and life-affirming. I felt so much energy in me, so much power! 

Escaline feels extremely lucid and concept piercing, feels very similar to my experimentation with low-dose (100-200mg) Mescaline with Harmaline. The clarity of thought was astounding!


Similar to Mescaline, it was very euphoric to do body stretches and yoga stuff! xscalines are the best chems for yoga and body work as they all induce body euphoria and supply connection to earth, the ground, very warming.


Music sounded incredible! I listened to three live albums by Ashra Temple and was glowing almost literally. I felt very happy, but it was "organic" wholesome feeling of happiness because of the realuisation that I am alive and able to experience life right now - it was an amazing feeling gratitude towards our Earth and all living beings.


I felt my mind was capable of resolving a lot of conflicts, dealing with past mistakes (memory recollection was really good and effective), asking myself questions like "what I want in life" and getting answers right away.


Visuals only included brightness amplification and "sparkliness", but I think Mescaline-like visions are not far away and just limited by dosage. Next time I will definitely try a larger amount, about 86mg I'm thinking - we'll see if this turns them up! 8)


For the purity of the experiment I should have abstain from adding the tryptamine but I could not resist the urge - building euphoria just screamed to me to add more! I know for a fact that xscalines (and most other phens) are to be taken once throughout the trip, since they take forever for me to come up and I build a tolerance almost immediately. So I instinctively took the 4-HO-EPT which was an absolute hit! I think 4-AcO-MET might play nicely with Escaline too, maybe even DET's subs...


All in all, I highly recommend to try Escaline for those who always wanted to try Mescaline but were never able to. They are very similar with Escaline being a lot more mind-oriented, very aware and lucid. Mescaline offers more visuals and unique visions, as well as more euphoric body feel but it also has an inevitable puking and a very long comedown. With Escaline (mixed with 4-HO-EPT) I came down by the 12th hour and was able to sleep comfortably.

Hey, man, I sure wish my escaline I got wasn't apparently quite impure. ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  Sounds great!  How does it compare to proscaline?  Also, what does your escaline look like?  Mine is a chalky white powder, whereas my proscaline (which is definitely good) is a shimmering, flaky crystal powder.


With mescaline I don't find it to be a "comedown"... it's immensely comfortable the whole time, I feel like gradually it just becomes part of me, rather than coming down.  Do you get an unpleasant comedown from mescaline?

My escaline is a glittery/shimmery white like your proscaline. It's the only 'xscaline' I've had the chance to try, wasn't blown away by 50mg, but it was a good trip, long comeup of course but as you said it was fairly life-affirming, "don't forget who you are" type stuff. 


That trip was two apartments ago lol and I haven't touched it since, might dig it out after reading your report

Anyone have experience taking this while on an SSRI? I take 10mg of Lexapro (escitilopram) every night. Could it possibly be a dangerous combo, or would the escaline be substantially dulled? I've taken ald-52 without stopping the Lexapro and still tripped, but it was definitely dulled. Would one expect escaline to be more or less dulled?

It won't be dangerous, psychedelics and SSRIs do not produce a dangerous combination, but for many people the trip is dulled.  Some people seem to be affected more or less the same, while some find it really hard to trip.  Sounds like you're one of the ones where psychedelics are dulled, so I'd expect this to be the case with all serotonergic psychedelics.

**Xorkoth**, my Escaline is crystalline looking, shiny and somewhat scaly powder of white color with yellowish tinge. IME all x-scalines are shiny off-white crystals, allyl ones being darker tan in color. Chalky white powder does sound a bit strange, have you tried reagent test it?


The comedown from Mescaline is not bad but I usually can't fall asleep having a hyperactive mind and having headaches (most phenethylamines do it to me at high enough dose) at about 14-16hrs past intake. It does not happen with lower dosage and/or when taken with MAOI. My normal typical dosage for extracted cactus HCL would be between 300-500mg.


**DroneLore**, have you tried using phenethylamine based stimulants while on Lexapro?

If everything went fine with that, then Escaline should do fine as well IMO. Something tells me that x-scalines will not be dulled as much by SSRIs as most tryptamine based psychedelics. 

SSRIs are involved in inhibition of cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme that metabolizes a lot of drugs but since Mescaline is unaffected by it, I theorize that Escaline is also unaffected by this enzyme so I dont see any direct or dangerous interaction between two.

^^^For those who didnt get much out of Escaline - maybe try it in a combo with a tryptamine of your choice? (but only if you know how to handle your shit if something goes wrong!)


Few other things to mention:

Escaline was not erotic and made me withdraw to analytical and spiritual realms, despite giving a pleasurable body feel. Thoughts of intimacy just didnt come up.

It was quite a pronounced anorectic too, in a similar fashion to Mescaline - had to force myself to eat some fruit and drink some almond milk throughout the day after ingestion, all tasted delicious though! :D

I got is GC/MS lab tested actually, it contained escaline and a variety of other peaks.  I know it's bad, I was just wondering.  It's a shame because I have multiple grams of this shitty escaline.  Got 3C-E, 3C-P and proscaline from the same source (very, very cheap Chinese vendor) and the other 3 are all good, quite pure, they look like they should.  But unfortunately the escaline was bad which sucks because it's the one I was most interested in.

If you have multiple grams of it and it is useless anyways I would recommend a cleanup. 


Either go for recrystallization from IPA or do an AB extraction. PM me if you need details.

I seem to have missed that very good question! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Proscaline feels more recreational, dissociative, pain-relieving (quite pronounced actually) and anti-depressant (using sporadically at 10-12mg with other supplements for that purpose), and so it is very useful chem IME, and a great versatile mixer and a party drug (perfect for music jam sessions with beers and people you never met!). Proscaline is definitely pro-social and shows entactogenic effects, not as strong as with MDMA but definitely noticeable. It is less of an anorectic than Escaline but presents some tight chest feelings if going up past 50mg where Escaline only caused a minor nausea on the come-up.

I prefer Proscaline to MDA (although they combined nicely8)) and APBs/APDBs lately for it's empathy and sociability due to positive glow instead of mild depression that follows afterwards with most serotonin releasers.


Escaline feels a lot more ehtheogenic than P, intuitively I got into meditative mind set with it. Escaline has deeper and more meaningful head space than P. Thinking of hedonistic type of fun was not naturally happening with it as it does with Proscaline. Escaline might be combined successfully with some 4-AcO-DMT I think, for some spiritual or mental insights. But Escaline is not necessarily an introverted drug, on the opposite - it is quite extraneous and make you want to communicate, just not as much as with Proscaline, IME.

Thanks for the comparison. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  Have you had mescaline?  How do both compare to mescaline?  I've had M and P, and I find that P has some similarities to M but M provides such a more profound and well-rounded experience, also the feeling from M is one of centeredness and peace, wisdom and good humor.  P seems a little more like a euphoric stimulant.

Yes, I have taken both synthesized Mescaline and extracts from various cactuses in different forms (brews, HCL salts, H2SO4 salts) with the exception of trying real peyote buttons. If I understand correctly, peytote will be psychoactive only if it grows in the wild, which is pretty rare to find. 


After trying AL, MAL, M, E, P and 3C-P, I'd say Mescaline is the best of the bunch providing the most rounded wholesome experience where you feel like you don't need anything else to be happy.


Escaline follows in closely being slightly less euphoric and meaningful and with less visual activity but being the closest to M out of all x-scalines analogs. Synthesized Mescaline felt very similar to my Escaline experience, kind of clean and a bit sterile but still a very fun trip.


Then I would put Methallylescaline - if not for it's weird memory clouding effects and nausea, it could have been even #1 for me. Also the rarity of it nowadays.


Than goes Proscaline. IMO it is far from being just an euphoric stimulant, especially if choosing the right combo and set/setting (had a very strong trip combining 30mg of P with 15mg of 4-HO-MiPT)! 

I would put 3C-P right there with Proscaline as their effects are quite similar, and 3C-P feeling like I added some DOC to my Proscaline.


Finishing up with Allylescaline - it does not mean that this chem is useless! I like it a lot for long day hikes, it goes very nicely with beers and a company of friends, very good for giggles, I repeat - Allylescaline is VERY GOOD for giggles, especially if combined with weed! ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

Thanks for the comparisons. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  The vendor I got my proscaline, escaline, 3C-E and 3C-P from (of which all but the escaline was good quality) was also offering MAL, AL, and cyclopropylmescaline (CPM) which is was very excited to try, CPM seems to be loved by experimenters in PIHKAL and compared to mescaline.  But the others were always "still being synthed" and eventually I changed my order to some other stuff.  Really wish I had a chance to try MAL also.  It would have been really cool to get some CPM because I haven't heard of anyone having or trying it, really, except in PIHKAL.

We need MAL back, along with introduction of CPM! ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)

I would be sooo happy to know that someone is going to synth CPM!..8)

peyote is active when grown at home and in the wild with higher concentrations being found in older specimens. always wanted to try MAL. Mesc HCL is the way to go especially with such strong San Pedro hybrids being in circulation these days.

Thanks for posting your meta-analysis Volsam, it's always very interesting to read a comparison across a class of chemicals! I haven't gone very far into exploring the 'scalines aside from mescaline from cacti, which I enjoy very much.

I'm interested to hear about these strong hybrids. I haven't followed what's been going on in the world of cactus growing lately.

I felt escaline was fairly similar to mescaline as well. Closet analogue I tried anyway. People used to always talk shit about San Pedro but it was my favorite. It can definitely have a big variable of percentages but if you find someone skilled at growing it who does so in a good climate you can get some high mescaline SP. When I found that I ditched PT for the most part. One time I was able to get a quarter of mescaline acetate in the form of yellow powder from a fairly insignificant amount of powder compared to the normal. That was my first experience with strong Pedro. I used the amounts I was used too and got three plus times the yield. Win! Miss those days...

A lot has been covered on this stuff so I can only add a small bit which is my personal take on it.


Lasts way too long & the load on your body is savage, I felt like I had been hit by a truck after coming down, really not worth the 12 hours I was under it to say the least.
