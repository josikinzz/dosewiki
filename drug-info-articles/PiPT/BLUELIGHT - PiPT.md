Propyls on the simple tryptamine series have always been good and restored the lost drama,if you compare for example with ethyl (maybe with some loss in potency noticeable).


On the other side,isopropyl did always add some reliance on (oral) potency/activity or add a distinct new flavour (usually with quite an increase in potency and duration).Propyl-isopropyl should theoretically be an interesting new mix on the tryptamine nitrogen.


Of the known simple isopropyl tryptamines,all have activity at 25mg,10mg could at least be felt,in the case for MIPT and DIPT.The closest thing known is EIPT which in TIHKAL sounded quite out of synch in regards to qualitative effects,but the dose range 25-40mg falls into expectations.Quite similar were the expectations for PIPT,but with some improved quality.So I was quite thrilled then to start the testing.This to all the prerequisites and expectations (you always have them)


25mg orally of PIPT freebase were indeed the first dose were at least some effects could be suspected,but it was surprisingly weak,almost placebo like.Maybe a hint of visual enhancement typical of trypties onset,followed by a headache (not from the compound I guess),maybe objects moved a bit but my thinking was clear as before.No cardiovaskular signs noted,but the most distinct effect seemed a certain degree of "throat and lung stimulation",something I know of certain DO's and stimulants.After 2-3h everything was gone.The body rejected nothing,and the expectations were still in place,maybe it takes a somewhat larger dose as MGS suggested.While I know that I can't take up much from oral DPT unless going 200-300mg,MPT was active at 50mg.


It was judged that a doubling again of the dose would be safe.Now I'm still in the process of making up my mind on the 50mg dose.But surely,not much happened.Hopefully the stock will last into full activity ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

Hugo, you're my hero!!


Seriously, if you check my posts here over the year, you'll find me begging and groveling for further research into PiPT.

I have no firsthand experiance with this chem, but I have a feeling it will be very succeptable to mao like dpt, and it may show no non-placebo effects until at least the 100mg mark orally. This is not to say that insufflation or smoking the freebase may be more effective as these routes are exposed to much less mao. Still, it is the epitome of a research chemical, so be very careful with your explorations. Keep us posted and send your findings to erowid!!!

Yeah I was going to say, lack of oral activity doesn't mean much.  Although (as far as I am concerned) the oral route is ideal, some of these tryptamines (DPT comes to mind) are simply better by other routes.


I say smoke some!

Yeah some tryptamines are better by the smoking route (DET and DPT come to mind),but has this been the case for any of the isopropyls?MIPT is about the same oral vs. smoked,DIPT doesen't get more potent either,maybe the quality changes.And EIPT appears to be active orally in the same dose range as expected for the smoking route,though never tried.I think the whole concept of the isopropyl group was to protect it against MAO/make it orally active.


But yes,I surely will put aside enough for smoking trials,don't wanna waste too much precious PIPT for my MAO the sucking bitch ![:o](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f631.png) .

Sorry to go off-topic.....but have you tried MIPT via smoking?  How did you find it.  What did you think of MiPT in general, compared to other (i)-propyl-containing tryptamines?

MGS-didn't smoke it personally,just judging the sparse information available.Didn't you post recently about a friend smoking it with same boring results?


Might try 100mg PIPT orally first,then as next smoke some 25mg.

From your post in the MET thread from 8. Dez. :


"I actually saw notes last night of someone who did smoke MiPT and the reported effects didn’t seem too much different from swallowing it. And no rush either."

I linked to this in the Best of PD page.  I know it's little and has no real information right now, but for the sake of completeness it should be linked to.  Plus, I'm hoping someone tries it.

Here's what happened with 53mg.I expected I would feel distinct effects since 25mg showed some threshold effects:


3h's after I ate some food,I took 53mg PIPT.15min later,just coming out from a shower,I noted some visual enhancement,the colored tiles on the wall glowed in a rewarding way,another 5min later the same throat paresthesie/stimulation of the earlier experiment could be felt more pronounced,its a bit like on 2C-B.A trace of nausea manifests,but still at T+45min there was almost nothing relevant happening,and yet I think I'm way above baseline of something.


I checked for altered auditory perception,my own voice sounded a bit strange,but nothing else.But theres a distinct euphoria/stimulation building up from the stomach,reminding me of MDMA.


At +1h,I wrote down that its definitively active,but what it is?I put on TV to see the news,the face of the speaker looked distorted,but didn't move,it just looked strange-is this an early sign of a sense distorter?Some tactile enhancement was noted,but the compound is neither erotic nor pushing me to do anything in that direction.At T+2h,still something going on,but it is already on the wane,30min later I was out,no after effects.


Conclusion:the chronology can be determined with some accuracy,but the nature of the effects are not yet apparent.A clear +1,confirming the plus/minus of the 25mg experiment.So a higher dose is necessary.

Why 53mg?  Is that just what was dumped out on the scale?


Appreciate you sharing notes.  It appears that the isopropyl does not increase the potency...I bet we are going to be looking at least 150mg orally to get decent effects.  So maybe a little bit more potent than DPT but not by much.  On the other hand, IM may be the way to go with this one.  It is that way with DPT.

Yeah that was on the scale and judged to be okay.


Surely before going to deal with the hassle of IM,I'll smoke it.Say 25mg to see if its different from the 25mg p.o..But I'm still confident 100mg orally will show its true colors.With these new compounds I'm always reminded of a line from DIPT in TIHKAL "If I were deaf, this would have been an inactive compound. How many other drugs have appeared to be inactive because I didn't know where to look for effects?".The euphoria from PIPT seemed a bit more than just a +1...


btw,the smell is almost inexistent on PIPT,MGS is right,pure tryptamines do not always have the strong smell as I thought.PIPT has something gaseous with fine notes of orange flowers-pretty good in fact!

AMT and AET are the ones with the super pungent odor.  DMT smells kind of nice IMO.

Yeah, I occasionally sit around and smell DMT crystals because the smell is very pleasant and evocative and gives me a little thrill, almost like the very start of its onset without progressing any further. 


And god damn... AET smells shitty (literally).  But AMT smells about 5 times stronger, although the smell itself is pretty much the same.

It seems the elves were listening to my pleads on this forum several years ago for someone to make some PiPT, and so santa has sent me a very interesting gift this season...


Why PiPT: For really no reason other than chemical-suggestion, there is no reason behind my obsession with it beside the fact that DPT and DiPT are two of my favourite tryptamines, and that taking them simultaneously provided amazing synergy and a fantastic trip. But as we have seen with other examples, substitutions like these seem to completely alter the essential effects of a drug. For example, AFAIK, there are no drugs to date, no matter how close, that precisely mimic DiPT's pitch-drop. I am not talking about sound-distortions, but the almost mathemtaically-consistent drop in pitch that those who tried DiPT are well familliar with.


But I digress.


Although I had been off psychedelics for several years now, I've been blessed with a small sample of PiPT freebase, and you betcha I'm going to be trying it sooner than later. 


If all goes well, I'll attempt to IM it as fumarate/acetate. 


Since hugo is the only other person that I know who had tried to date, I've had some discussion of dose with him. But I'd like to get more input from others as to speculations about IM dose.


I have a very tiny bit of the material (probably enough for only 1 dose anyway), and so it would seem I'll need to get a silver-bullet dose from the first-try.  


Any ideas?

As for the dose of PIPT, just seen that I smoked only 25mg. Your typical doses you wrote me on DPT and DIPT sound like average (for a change...). So I would advise against taking like 100mg i.m., 100mg DPT i.m. is quite a blast... and chances are that PIPT is a bit more potent.


Given that 25mg smoked PIPT tasted quite active here I think it fits perfectly into the pattern of all 'IPT's being active at 25-50mg by an active ROA (based on MIPT,EIPT,DIPT infos.). A bit higher mol weight, a bit higher of a dosage needed. So as a reasonated guess I would give an i.m. dosage range of 25mg-75mg. Meaning you could safely nibble with a 25mg shoot and then decide if you wanna go straight to 75mg. 


The only problem in your way is that your expectations are way too high to be matched! Don't set you up for dissapointment! No dissapointment=good new RC is born and maybe more compound finally becoming available ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png)


And be aware that EIPT appears like a crapper altough it has never been tested outside Sahas circle.


Discussion/dissent on my dose suggestions are welcome!

Did Jamshyd ever try this one? I'd love to hear about IM administration.


I'm also wondering if anyone can speculate about 4-HO-PiPT? 


I am guessing the differences between simple tryptamines and their HO/AcO cousins are too distinct to be able to corelate much about 4-HO-PiPT...

I have only ever seen one report on this.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was made available though given how many others are.  It's very close to DPT.

I am thrilled that I may finally get a chance to try 4-ho-pipt!! 4-ho-dipt and 4-ho-dpt were both excellent, so this may be as well (although a cross between lovely compounds isn't guaranteed to be good i.e. 5-meo-det). I expected this long before the MALTs, DALTs, and McPT derivatives...

Me too, i find the 5-meo series altogether less enjoyable for me, due to a more pronounced physical effect (in general) than the 4-ho/aco versions of the trypts I’ve tasted.

I think there's good reason to be a bit more leery of the 5-methoxytryptamines than their 4-hydroxy equivalents, given the problems Shulgin discovered with certain substitutions like 5-MeO-DET and 5-MeO-DPT that seem less apparent in 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-DPT, respectively.


However, if anything I think I may prefer 5-MeO-MiPT to 4-HO-MiPT, so I'm not writing them off entirely.

I generally like 5 subs, but I'm still leery of new ones. They're certainly not always the safest.


Also, seriously, why does PiPT have to be a positional isomer of a scheduled substance?


Here's some quotes I found elsewhere from three years ago:


"EiPT sucks compared to MiPT so... don't bother.

Would you like a trip report for PiPT? It's fucking great...I'll write up a trip report in the next day or two. I made a short analysis in another comment in this thread. Funnily enough, "foxymeth" is the perfect name for this substance. 


"Could you please make a comparison between [PiPT and 5-MeO-MiPT? I wonder if PiPT is even better for parties"


"5-MeO-PiPT is apparently going to be available in a month or two, but meant PiPT. I don't know how great it would be at a party... but an orgy? Fuck yes.

This is my first experience with it. The dose was 55mg vaporized. YMMV

To paraphrase: it has sexual energy topped only by pyrovalerones, and tactile euphoria that reminds me of the jelly feeling of dph (without the dysphoria) combined with the fluid, vibrating perfection of a candyflip. The visuals pulsate, they're layered like I could see the eyes of myself in other universes simultaneously, with different "types" of visuals in each. Uhh... "powerful" erections spontaneously occurred several times throughout the experience. Empathy and passion were my sole emotions, when I looked at my spouse I saw the embodiment of love and everything good in the world. We talked about our lives, hopes, and dreams. We laughed, cried, cuddled, and made love. It was weird though. Weird, because the sex had the devious, depraved intensity of stimulants combined with the love and passion of psychedelics... I would do a smaller dose next time as this was more powerful than I planned for.

So, obviously I don't want to let this comment over hype it. New substances can be misleading. I will definitely be using this again and I suggest other do, but go into the experience without expectations or preferences; keep an open and clear mind."

Personally, I'd start at around 5mg after an allergy test and slowly increase from there. I don't want to make assumptions about potency, but that's the level I started at with 4-ho-dpt and 4-ho-dipt without any issues other than wasting a bit of 4-ho-dpt before reaching an active dose at around 12mg.


Given how the tryptamine family throws an occasional curveball like 5-meo-det it couldn't hurt to start lower than 5mg, I just mentioned how I would go about testing it personally.

I will definitely start low for the usual reasons, but I'm not sure if I want to be the first in the world to try it...


Still, if I were to be the first, I would start even lower than 5mg, just in case there was something bad in the synth, etc...

But as we have seen with other examples, substitutions like these seem to completely alter the essential effects of a drug. For example, AFAIK, there are no drugs to date, no matter how close, that precisely mimic DiPT's pitch-drop.

Without having had DIPT. The pitch drop of 5-Meo-DIPT seem's to be about the same. But with effect's that mimic LSD and/ or Psylocybine added, or maybe more a cross between em. 


As a whole, the 5-Meo added psychedelic and side effect's to the trip. Vasocontrition being the most annoying one. 


The influence on audio was unique though. Never had that with a psychedelic drug, so that made it worthwhile.

I have had both, and DiPT's pitch change is in completely new territory than 5-MeO-DiPT's... if 5-MeO-DiPT is like taking one hit of acid for your ears, then DiPT is like smoking DMT for your ears.  At a full dose, no sounds even resemble sounds as they used to be.  Human voices sound like frog robots, birds sound like giant wire tension snapping, it's completely alien and bizarre.  DiPT is very different from 5-MeO-DiPT.

So it's not in the same ballpark? 


Now DIPT seem's even more bizar. Would you charactarize it more psychedelic as the 5-Methoxylated anlogue. 

5-Meo-DIPT seemed very dirty in effect's. The unbareable side effect outweighing the positive ones. But the influence on pitch control was remarkeable. 


Some of the Tryptamine's are really good discoveries. ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)-ed 4-HO-MET and putting DIPT on my to do list.

DiPT is very unique in its effects.  It definitely feels cleaner than 5-MeO-DiPT, also I would say it is more psychedelic, personally, but less visual.  It's a really strange psychedelic, I find it quite profound, but you have to dose pretty high.


DiPT goes well  beyond simple pitch changing, the effect it has on sound is completely transformative, but to the point that listening to music is interesting for a time, but not that enjoyable because music starts to sound like just a bunch of noise.  I found it much more rewarding to go outside and listen to the world.  It's an experience unlike anything else.  if you don't dose high enough, it just drops pitches, but once you cross a certain threshold, it's totally unique and far stronger than 5-MeO-DiPT in its sound effects.

I did 5-meo-dipt, 4-ho-dipt, and 4-aco-dipt quite a few times in the early 2000s and early 2010's, and never experienced any noticable changes in auditory perception at doses ranging from 4mg to 50mg. I was actually disappointed that I didn't get to experience the distorted auditory perception, having tried 5-meo-dipt, 4-ho-dipt, and 4-aco-dipt without ever experienced that particularly novel effect. 


I haven't tried dipt itself yet, so this one will be fairly highly prioritized once I get done with my kratom taper and can feel alive without kratom in my system *at all times*. Theres a few compounds on my list to try above dipt. I wish I had any kind of timetable for these assays, but need to be in a proper headspace for lab ratting myself with random, unheard of chemicals...

excuse me for digging a bit offtopic but:...

I recommend you to take kratom 3-5 times a week maximum. I usually take 2-8 grams a day, sometimes twice a day, but preferably once, and well, the maximum days I did in a row were 2-3 weeks, normally I do some breaks of one and four days between doses. Been using it for almost 3 years, without building a lot of tolerance (it affects me properly but I do not normally the burst of mental/body euphoria in the beggining like the first year..)  so I didn't rise the dosage... that's the main risk I think, specially cause the half-life of other components (not only mytragynine and derivatives) should be quite long so it affects the entire feeling of the experience if you don't let them leave your system..

So the only good about 5-Meo-DIPT. Take the pitch and the akin to Acid feel, the first was not even a typical effect. I seem the only one of our group that had it, you guy's didn't get it. Weird.


Makes me wanna try it out one more time. But that dosages you took 50mg. That is quite a rock, my balls would be in my neck I think. Will need to be on a lot of Benzo's before going there. And my sudden epileptic insult's prevent me from going that road.


Taking care of ones self is nr. 1 priority.

I wholly agree with Xorkoth's above posts. 5-MeO-DiPT distorts (not enhances) sound to an extent, but this effect pales in comparison with DiPT.


The suggestion that DiPT's aural effects yield better results outdoors is very true, especially in nature -- moving water, animal sounds, rustling leaves, for example, can make for a much more profound experience than by listening to grossly mutilated music. While it's interesting to listen to your favorite art while on DiPT, you're probably not going to get much insight from it -- ten to twenty minutes should suffice, for shits and giggles, and novelty value, but that's it.


At the right dose, I consider DiPT to be a potentially rather deep experience. On the other hand, 5-MeO-DiPT, while often fun and rewarding in its own way, is much less useful for going deep and perhaps learn something.

^ Your perceptions echo mine exactly.  4-HO/AcO-DiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT are not even remotely in the same ballpark for audio distortion as DiPT is.  DiPT has an utterly unique effect among all known psychedelics.  I think of it as DMT for your ears.  A lot of early reports (including in TIHKAL) suggested it has no headspace at all, but that has not been my experience whatsoever, I find it quite mentally altering and even quite deep at sufficient dosage.


I'll also repeat what lamanogauncha said, you might think that DiPT would be the ultimate drug for listening to music, but music is actually quite strange and even unpleasant on it, if you achieve full distortion (lower dosages simply drop pitch but intervals remain consistent, but full doses cause all interval relationships to go out the window and even some pitches to no longer sound like a pitch at all but rather some bizarre pitchless sound).  My main full-dose experience (also my first DiPT experience and one of my early psychedelic experiences), I listened to music for the first hour... it was great as the effects were building, but then at a certain point it just started to sound like noise, quite jarring even.  It was at that point that I went outside, and the experience became utterly astounding and magical.


I also find it more difficult to interact with people on DiPT than on almost any other psychedelic because all voices, including your own, sound like robotic alien frogs... it is truly disorienting to try to converse in such a state.


Anyway this isn't the DiPT thread, is it?  ![😁](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f601.png)

Psychonauts usually pay attention to visual queues to gauge how hard they are tripping. Since DiPT offers virtually nothing in this department, trippers tend to ignore what is going on in their mind -- their thinking and cognition -- and instead focus on a futile search for visual effects. This contributes to the erroneous idea that this drug offers little headspace. DiPT can yield abundant headspace. For example, if I remember correctly, the late MGS had a ++++ experience with a mere 50mg of the stuff taken orally.


Anyhow, this is indeed the PiPT thread, so I'm going to get the PiPT out of here and leave you guys to discuss this rare chemical. Cheers.

Yes he did, though it may have been 70mg.  My main experience with it was with 50mg, orally, and it was a strong +3.

Keep in mind that my highest doses of 5-meo-dipt came during a binge in which I had worked up a bitch of a tolerance. I started in the single digit range and found that tolerance built up faster than with any other psychedelic I've tried. It was all from the same gram over about 6 months. Initially, less than 10mg was sufficient, but after dosing several times a week over several months, tolerance was inevitable. It's not exactly my proudest moment lol. I probably should have mentioned massive tolerance in connection with doses that high, because I don't want to see other people take a dose that high and end up in their personal hell or in an emergency room. I'll make an effort to make sure I mention the level of tolerance when speaking of my highest doses. Thanks for pointing that out![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png) I can't believe I forgot to include that very salient detail ![😳](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f633.png)

No worries about an off topic post here and there. I'm in the process of my 2nd attempt at a slow taper to get away from using kratom at such high doses. I'm stabilized at 50g/day split into 15g in the morning, 10g in the afternoon, and 25g at night. I'm down more than 50% compared to a few weeks ago when I started on montelukast and it completely screwed up my metabolism of both kratom and my Rx alprazolam. For a few days, I was taking 30g 4x daily just to avoid withdrawal. 


My Dr had to significantly increase my benzodiazepine dose, as my blood plasma levels were nowhere close to what they should have been. Now that the montelukast has cleared my system and my metabolism is back to normal, I'm back trying to get clean. 


I dont intend to stop using kratom entirely as it works better than opiates and gabapentinoids for nerve damage resulting from a serious injury last September than resulted in a ruptured disk at c6-c7, torn trapezious, torn rotator cuff, and broken collarbone. I have seizures from most traditional opiates, so kratom was my best option for pain post surgery. I know it wasn't the best plan, but it was the best I could do with the circumstances I was dealing with.


Prior to my neck injury, I had used kratom responsibly for upwards of a decade, dosing 7-10g 2 of 3 nights on average and had no withdrawal symptoms before my injury. I ended up dosing 3x daily at doses of 8g, then 10g and so on until I was taking around 75g daily. Once my pain started to really subside, I started tapering and got down to 27g/day prior to starting the montelukast. Though I don't intend to continue taking such high doses, it's going to take a while to taper back down in relatively reasonable doses and not needing kratom every day.


I appreciate the concern though, good looking out![👍](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f44d.png)

Same here. It seems most people are all about the 4-HO tryptamines, but I think the simple tryptamines are really underappreciated.

"Like other tryptamines I've bought from the same vendor, this batch of PiPT that's being sold right now seems kind of impure. It is made up of hard waxy chunks with a strong smell. I would recommend an acetone wash for anyone who doesn't like ingesting random synthesis byproducts. Put your PiPT in a shot glass, add some dry acetone, crush it up with a stirring rod or something, and remove the acetone. Repeat several times until you end up with a nice off-white powder."


*and*


"After being being curious about PiPT for a long time, I finally got my hands on some PiPT fumarate last week. I took about 100mg of it orally. The first thing I noticed was a feeling of relaxation and euphoria. It was a slow gradual come up, nice and gentle with no nausea.  Everything began to look softer and colors were altered a little bit.


When the trip reached its peak everything about it was still pretty subtle. There wasn't too much going on visually, but there seemed to be this colored haze which reminded me of the visuals from MiPT. I was surprised by the lack of body load. Mentally I felt mostly sober, but there was a bit of a dreamy feeling.


Despite the mildness of the effects, I somehow felt like I had taken a strong dose of the drug. I'm not sure how to explain it. I felt like if I had taken a higher dose it would have been too much. PiPT is like a ghost, trying to remain mostly unnoticed even when in full effect. The subtleness of it reminded me of DALT.


My overall impression of PiPT is that it isn't particularly interesting but can be an enjoyable experience. I have experience with a lot of tryptamines, and PiPT is one of the mildest in effect. If I had to compare it with something I would say it's most like a weaker version of MiPT.


Unlike the two trip reports I've read about PiPT, it didn't make me feel particularly horny. I do find MiPT to be one of the most erotic drugs though, so I guess I can see how PiPT could have that potential since they have some similarities."


I saw this in a post on another forum and decided to share it here. I will be following their advice and doing an acetone wash. It's hard to extrapolate much from their description of an oral dose--a lot of base tryptamines are boring when taken orally. Still, this does sound pretty in line with what I'm expecting based on my 4-HO-PiPT experience: dreamy, mostly non-visual, feels weird somatically, and not erotic.

Huh, interesting.  There are some absolutely glowing reports from previous times.  Someone should send it to a lab for analysis.


Though I will say, freebase base tryptamines (tryptamines in general as freebases, actually) are often absolutely rank, so a strong smell might not mean anything.  But not sure what form this PiPT is in.


EDIT: Oh it's fumarate.

It's the fumarate and it's in waxy chunks the same salmon color of the N,N-MiPT that I've seen. Base tryptamines are often pretty rank smelling, that's for sure! The fact that acetone washes produced a whitish powder is interesting to me, though.


As for it not being glowing, I haven't read any positive reports on it orally, just vaporized. I also fully expect the PiPTs to be enjoyable for a lot of people, but it seems like the somatic sensations are pretty different in different bodies. With 4-HO-PiPT, the experience was marked by somatic sensations, but they were neither good nor bad.

So the acetone wash was a fail on my end. The chunks were too waxy to break apart effectively. Even worse, the acetone wash did remove the pink discoloration from the PiPT that it came in contact with, and the acetone left an oily, reddish residue behind after evaporation. Worse yet, trying to recover the PiPT from the filter paper proved difficult, as the PiPT had become even softer and gooier somehow. I dissolved it in anhydrous ethanol (with a little difficulty) to try to recover it all, but then had issues when evapping it. What an expensive pain in the ass, made worse by confirmation that it appears that there are impurities in the synth.

Wow, well thanks for reporting on that regardless.  Can't you just evaporate the acetone and ethanol to recover it?

That's what I'm doing, but it's really gooey. I've tried on ceramic, glass, and silicone so far.

Despite the reports of impurities I decided to take the plunge on this one today. The stuff I have is beige waxy chunks, with uniform appearance. Smell/taste is reminiscent of other tryptamines.


20mg dissolved easily in 2ml water with a few drops of vinegar (dunno if the vinegar was necessary) and was promptly boofed. Within a few minutes I started feeling very slightly out of sorts. My thoughts became slower and more bizarre. Tactical sensation felt extra soft. This feeling never intensified and I believe I was at baseline after an hour.


I've been feeling quite depressed for weeks; not sure if that factored into the (lack of) effects. I guess I'll try again at 30 or 40mg next week.

Thanks for reporting! I might get around to vaporizing this one tomorrow or the next day - we'll see.

With respect to handling the recent gungey 'glue' like PiPT batch - I found sticking it in the freezer for a couple of hours turns it into a much more tractable, glassy/crystalline, solid.

Using a paper filter is where you went wrong. I tried an acetone wash and lost a good portion of the PiPT in a coffee filter. After that I didn't filter it and just waited a few minutes for the PiPT to settle at the bottom of the glass then removed the acetone with pipette. At first it didn't seem like the washing was working very well, but after 6 or 7 washes the PiPT became a white powder.


I've taken it one time. I think I took 60 mg at first then redosed another 30 or 40 mg a little later. It was not a very eventful trip, and to even call it a trip is a bit of a stretch. It wasn't bad, but it seems to be relatively subtle and less interesting than the average tryptamine. I think the early hype about PiPT was due to its novelty at a time when there were far fewer tryptamines on the market than there are now.

Out of interest, any rough idea as to what percentage of the starting material were you left with? And did you keep the acetone wash and see what kind of 'crud' was left on evaporation?

I don't know because I lost most of the PiPT in the filter. I discarded the acetone when I finished the wash.


Afterwards I acetone washed some brown chunky MiPT fumarate I had and ended up with a light tan powder. It lost about 5% of it's mass IIRC.
