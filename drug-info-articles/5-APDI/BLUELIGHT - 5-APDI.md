I am having a hard time finding any info on this substance.  I visited erowid and found this  [IAP trip](http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=24668).  Other than that I have only spoken to one other person about the experience.  This person agrees with the erowid trip report that IAP is very similiar to MDMA without some of the amphetamine side effects and hang over.

I think that it is also more euphoric than E.

I guess that why I'm interested LeadSinger.  I can't imagine anything being more euphoric than E but if IAP is it then I'm wondering why it isn't so popular.

Chemically, IAP is MDA without the oxygens in the MD ring, making it a methylene ring rather than a methylenedioxy ring.


unfortunately i have never used this chemical, so i have no real information to contribute here; i could only take information from elsewhere and paste it in here...

**IAP**


Tried IAP orally, 50mg + 25mg at T+1:07, a few weeks ago, and can confirm existing reports.  Long acting (12 hours before sleep possible), similar in feel to MDMA, but much, much milder.  No "launch", very gradual come-up at about 1 hour.  No "crash" or other negative effects the following day or (as of today) three weeks later.

my friend asked me to pass this on, although his experience didn't differ that much from the other reply's..well, a friend of mine and his lady friend played guinee pig..they found it to be, at 50mg., very long lasting and mdma 'like', although not nearly as full and.satisfying..left him wanting more..sorta half way there, which was rather dissapointing, but which also leads me to wonder what a higher dose would be like..it felt very benign, and yes it took nearly 2 hours to reach full effect, way after he had given up on it, and yes also a gradual comeup, and no real crash either..anyone tried this at say 60-70 mg. or higher?..i'd be very curious to hear..peace..

Earth and Fire have (apparently) not put up an official IAP vault yet, but i would expect it once they collect more information.


[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/iap/](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/iap/)


that's what they have, and all i can add.


Please be very careful about highly trying unexlplored drugs... Look up MPTP and look at what can possibly happen if one tries subtances which have not been investigated by numerous users. Personally, i don't think im excactly up to be the first death from a substance.


peace,

**propane?**


out of morbid curiosity i took 50mgs iap @ approx. 5:00pm orally.  by 6:00 am feeling something, by 7:00 i have reached 'plateau'.  nothing earth-shaking, but i became very satisfied, very good humored and upbeat.  my motivation went to shit8) and by midnight I was pretty much down.  i had to ask myself whether or not i was down, (the mild pupil dilation had subsided by this point) as the transition was so smooth.  it seemed to break the depression i had been in for 2 weeks after an argument with my father that ended with his arrest.  anyhoo, I found this chemical to be much more 'similar' in feel to mda than e.  


odd, but though I was 'on', i was VERY mellow, and VERY satisfied with things in general (worth noting as that mindset is somewhat rare for me.  

![:|](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eyesclosed.gif) next time i will try 70mg?


hope my 2cents helps!

First time today with IAP, i took about 50mg in a gelcap.  I was talking to my roommate after about 15 minutes, and, i think i might have been talking a little more than normal.  t+25 mins i was starting to feel warmth.  t+45 mins, sound sounds wonderful.


A while later for a good another hour, i felt incredibly euphoric and good.  You know, I was keeping track of times, but then i got walking around in euphoria, I felt like I could/would have hugged or "been all up on" any female that was to come over.  There were some minor visuals, that started a little later than the euphoria, some that were the "typical" wall morphing (mild), but the way colors were brightened, it was unique, "bright" in a different way than other psychedelics.  It was all good...   I did notice when it was wearing off i got the chills, feel sorta cold.   Thats the only bad part i noticed (sucks when you live in a colder area).  I will write up a trip report soon.

How about duration?  The reports range from 6-12 hours for 50 mg.


How long did you plateau?


....and I believe this is the first time I have read of any visuals.

Actually, It's MDA with each of the oxygens replaced by a methylene group, making it 3,4-trimethyleneamphetamine (IAP) as compared to  3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA)


And that raises an interesting question. What would be the psychoactivity of its MDMA homologue, i.e. 3,4-trimethylene-N-methylamphetamine i.e. N-methylIndanylaminopropane? I guess that's for another thread on another day. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

**IAP experience**


Hey everyone


After reading a couple of the erowid trip reports, I decided that I just had to try IAP. I used to be very enthusiastic about e, so thought this might be a legal, less damaging alternative. I obtained a small sample, and have now tried it twice. Both times, I took 50 mg. I am an acknowledged hardhead - I need 30 mg 2c-i to get stoned, needed 60 mg + of AMT, etc. 50 mg was more than enough for me. I advise anyone taking it for the first time not to start off with more than 50. I even felt a slight body load, and would probably have been uncomfortable if I'd taken more. It is strong as that dose, but not particularly euphoric. It definitely lifts your mood though. It's pretty hard to get mad when you're on IAP. I would agree that it's most similar to MDA. By no stretch of the imagination is it an e substitute. I noticed that it does go very well with alcohol. Contrary to what some may say, I cannot see IAP catching on and being extremely popular. There is an introverted aspect to it, so most people would probably prefer e or alcohol to IAP when going out partying.

While the sale of IAP is not illegal, **IAP is illegal when you use or sell it as a drug** on account of the analogue laws (assuming you are in the USA).  IAP is very close molecularly to MDA and you could very easily be arrested for using/selling it if the authorities actually knew what it was.


With the analogue laws in place, there are very few truly legal drugs.  The psychoactive plants in the nightshade family, fly agaric mushrooms, Salvia divinorum, and a few exotic herbs from Mexico that I can't spell and am too lazy to look up are the only truly legal drugs that I can think of.  Anything that is chemically related to a drug that is already illegal (IAP is related to MDA) are also illegal for human consumption.  You can use IAP to scrub your sink, but that's about it.

Alright, well, i am not a user of MDMA often, a few times a year mostly at lower doses i suppose (and thats only for the last couple years).  I've had "strong" doses of mdma, maybe just twice.  The others were sorta weak, there..but not much there.  Its been a while, so i suppose its hard to compare.  


I, and it seems, everyone else (that i know that have done this), seem to get a strong "E" feeling from 2c-i mixed with Neurontin.  The body buzz is totally changed, into a warmth, emphathy, that kind of buzz, plus the visuals from 2ci.  I've experienced this recently with 2c-t-21 also, I dont know if these things release a lot of serotonin, or the neurontin makes it do that, hell i have no idea why or how this mix works, but, if you have some PEA's and happen to have some neurontin (even just 400mg was enough for people to feel it, but 800-1200mg was better), i would highly recommend the mix! (2c-i especially!).  I will have to try taking some neurontin along with IAP.


IAP after a couple hours, was SO euphoric, i believe it was way more euphoric than my previous higher dose E times.  Definitely not introspective, I felt very disinhibited, horny, and unfortunately I was alone for most of the experiment, because if some girls came in with my roommate or whatever, i would have gone up to any of them and just hugged them, without thinking twice.  I was very high!  It did not last anywhere near 12 hours, thats for sure.  The mass euphoria lasted i'd say, about 3 hours (plateau), maybe 5 hours total..


During this peak/plateau, I was getting definite trails, and the color enhancement was beautiful.  No morphing or any other visuals.  Music sounded incredible, I was blasting music getting chills, loving it.  I found myself staring outside, when it was still light out, just looking at the brightness and clarity of everything (and taking notice of any female passing by).  


I will have to try a lower dose next time, and see how that compares, or maybe repeated lower doses over a longer time span.  I'm curious about tolerance, as I do not feel at all bad days after, i'm in a decent mood really.  I read somewhere that it might be somewhat of an SSRI, maybe blocking the reuptake at the same time its releasing serotonin? Who knows..  I like this stuff though thats for sure.


** I bet sex would be wonderful on this, especially if you reach the level of euphoria I had, there is no "limp dick" problem, from the lack of stimulation (and vaso-constriction).

**IAP- Save your money!**


So there's been a growing buzz on the internet for the last couple of months about IAP, IndanylAminoPropane.


I got really curious so I procured an amount of it to try. I must say that I am wholeheartedly disappointed in it. For those of you hoping IAP would be a cool "legal" MDMA replacement, you have another thing coming. This stuff sucks, to be quite blunt.


It in NO WAY resembles MDMA. Actually, it is strikingly similar to DXM, which I also hate (of course there are some people that think that DXM is "similar" to MDMA, so whatever. Now I have a gram of this crap lying around that I wasted my money on.


50 milligrams of IAP gave me an almost identical experience as about 150 milligrams of DXM, except with just a touch of stimulation after a few hours, and this lasted longer. So those of you who love DXM will probably really like this stuff, but it's so damned expensive that you'll likely want to stick to DXM.


I now know exactly what everyone else means about this being a very anti-social drug. Basically, I just wanted to be alone and hated having to communicate with anyone. I actually fell asleep for the first 2 hours of the effects, and then became mildly stimulated for the remainder of the effects.


So here's a most negative opinion on a substance that has been getting a lot more attention than it deserves. Pass this one up, folks, there are many more interesting ones out there that aren't so expensive. It smells like a flea collar, too!


I will say this, however; I will try it at least one more time to give it another chance. Does anyone know if it can be vaporized?

I don't know if you can vaporize IAP, but have considered the fact that the substance may not be pure, or that it may be a different chemical altogether? I have seen and heard some negative reports on IAP (though most of them seem top be positive) but I have never seen the compound compared to DXM. Or maybe it's just not the drug for you. IDK what to tell ya.![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif) ![:\](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/wrygrin.gif)  I'm looking forward experimenting with IAP myself.

I don't believe that the IAP I have is impure as it certainly appears pure with clumps of powder and whatnot. It doesn't at all look, smell, nor taste like DXM powder, so I know it's not that.

Wow! Quite a difference some people seem to get to the effects of this drug i guess.  First time I had it, I felt way better, waaay more social and sexual euphoric, than any of my previous E sessions (not many and only a couple-few decent ones).  I was even saying wow this is the best drug out of anything, i've ever done, period.  I didnt have a problem with stimulation, this stuff didnt seem to stimulate my body much but, 2nd time i took it, I had an extreme mental/drive motivation.  I wanted to wash dishes, clean my room, get anything and everything all done, it felt like when you "first" take anything like adderall/ritalin/meth/dex, like whoa there's that magic again only 10x as strong.  Put me in a great mood, very uninhibited, wanted to be around people especially females..etc.  Before you throw that gram in the toilet or whatever, uh, yeah, contact me about proper disposal, you know so you wont have to worry about killing anythihg down the pipes, yeah i think i have some place written down where i dispose of all my RC's that are unusable i'll have to find it, haha.

**hmmmm**


"... more social and sexual euphoric, than any of my previous E sessions (not many and only a couple-few decent ones). I was even saying wow this is the best drug out of anything, i've ever done, period. I didnt have a problem with stimulation, this stuff didnt seem to stimulate my body much but blah blah blah"


sounds like an info-mercial to me.


my advice is to save your $ for small samples of the material if you want to try it.


write reports, ye pillars of our community.

Will be interesting to see what happens with IAP. So far there have been a few varying reports... Hmmmm. Maybe its the property of the substance. The Alephs had wide ranging responses and dosages. 


Hmmmm. Could have to do with set and setting... More experimentation is in order.

**my opinion Indanylaminopropane**


I must generally agree


IAP was nothing very special.  It gave me mild euphoria, but by no means a rediculous I feel so good this is timeless kind of high.  Maybe instead of euphorica I should call it moments of pleasant-ness.  It comes up in about an hour and lasts near 6 hours (totally down by then).  It very much reminded me of an aderall feeling, but not quite as clearly speedy.  So fairly speedy, head sensation resembling adderall, and some facial/head warmth.


It didnt suck, but I dont have much desire to use it in the future.

I too found it to be nothing like what I had heard people claiming it to be.  It is in no way MDMA like.  It was pleasant at anywhere from 25 to 50 mg, but never anything mind blowing.  It is not something I would go out of my way to obtain.

^^^^^^^^^^


Do you not feel scaling up the dosage would make a difference?  I find for instance methylone pretty uninteresting at around 150 mg or less (unless I am mixing it with another psychedelic, in which case 150 mg is plenty) but at higher doses, especially around 175 mg, it becomes quite entheogenic and beautiful, well at least in the right setting.

Yes, scaling the dosage could indeed be the right approach here.

Since there does not seem to be all that much stimulation or other

unpleasant side-effects, it is probably something worth researching.


Research done so far


27mg IAP orally on empty stomach. Weight is about

170 pounds.


T+0:40 : very mild euphoria (cross between mild opiates and very small dose of MDMA). Gone in about 20 minutes. No other effects. Nothing mind blowing. Similar to small dose of methylone.


T+1:30 : pupils are still dilated, and mild pleasant afterglow. Take booster dose of 25mg.


T+2:00: another mild euphoria, but even less than last time. might as well have had a good cup of coffee for the same effect. Really not worth the risk of taking a completely unknown substance for such mild effects. 


Looks like the mind-blowing MDMA-like experience reports at 25mg should be viewed with a grain of salt.


All right, hard-core researchers, who is going to push the dose envelope and see what IAP has to offer?

I had a wholly unpleasant experience involving IAP.


50mg IAP (a very fine white powder) was injested, first time with this material. After 3 hours nothing more than a slight stimulation was noted, not euphoric but not in anyway threatening, but disappointing. I was hoping for something a bit more profound  and this was kind of like a few cups of coffee. So silly me, I took 30mg 2C-C which for me normally works fantastically as a boost/combo to MDxx type drugs. An hour later I entered a two hour period of absolute psychedelic hell. My state seemed to perfectly match Gracie and Zarkov's description of a 2C-B overdose ([http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_info2.shtml](http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/2cb/2cb_info2.shtml)). There were intense chills and tremors, inexplicable panic, extraordinary tactile sensitivity (not pleasant), and heavy visual and aural hallucinations for which I was in no mood to enjoy. For a while I contemplated what a stupid way this would be to die. Out on the edge of an untried drug combination. After about 1.5 hours of this hell curled up under blankets with the lights off, sound off, my girl friend downstairs thinking I'm up having a great time solo tripping, I took 2 xanax (saved for just such situations) and then a long hot shower. And then it all dropped off. I was back in the land of the normals and felt unusually hungry. Cheese sandwiches, wine, and my girl friend's company and things were finally OK again. The next day, a good mood but a bit worn out.


On my list of things to never do again.


This is not to put down IAP specifically, but in combinations great care should be taken. The potentiation was incredible in a bad way.


Is it possible that IAP is an MAO inhibitor? But then why would the xanax, wine and cheese have me feel better?

Some of my friends have tried this, and all were dissapointed.  Well one friend was enjoying himself, for a while, but overall, said "ahh its ok but nothing comes close to GHB or MDMA".  They all took lower doses than what I took, and last time I tried it, I took the same dose as 3 other friends and we all had a...well.. didnt seem to make it over the threshold i guess.  20-50mg just does not cut it for me with this, it seems like I have to take higher than that, or quickly re-dose, maybe more like 75mg..  40mg seems to produce very little effect with most of my friends, I noticed they were more talkative (the first thing that seems to happen with this, but, i'm not sure if you really 'feel' it in the body, like you would with a 'speedy' drug).  When i asked my friends (this was one night in particular, when I and 3 friends dosed) if they felt anything, they said not really (even though i noticed they were talking a lot more).


I barely felt anything this night also, I think the first couple times I did it I took a higher dose, and especially the first time, it blew me away...  but, it only lasted 3 hours or so, never anywhere near 6!  So if you happen to get a sample of this, of course i'd start low, see what it does, but if you get nothing out of it, not much out of 50mg, i'd go up a little more...seems to ME at least, that there is some line where it goes from "shitty drug" to "wow".  


^^^ of course, i'm just thinking in my head here, drugs are bad bad bad, so don't do what I just typed because its just some random daydream i'm having.

"a friend of mine said:"


ive tryed it several times and know several others who have also.  people who are sensitive to entheogens notice this one.  people who think thier e pills are cut w heroin dont seem to think it works at all.


it is active when smoked (5 and 10 mg)


it is active when insulflated, but to those w most of thier nose in tact it burns pretty freakin bad (up to 20mg tryed)


it is active orally, but i really must suggest letting it linger in your mouth a little because parachuting makes it last alot longer with less kick (up to 50mg tryed)


the effects are similar to MDA.  not mdma.  anyone familiar with MDA will probably like this.  there is a nice tingling with it but euphoria does not get overwhelming.  most people get visuals (similar to mda).  one person said he felt like he was shroomin on adderal.... and i can see what he meant, in a good way.  you can sleep w this one and eat quite easily  (not characteristic of mda)  there is no comedown, it just tapers off.  i found myself feeling refreshed and happy the morning after every trial. theres about an hour come up and effects can last for like 10 hours but the plateau is over by the 5th hour.


incredible synergy w cannabis.


hope this is of some help!!

IAP - 50mg oral (body weight 170lb/77kg) - Very long come up time of about 1.5hrs, extremely mild and gentle high (I really cannot see any justification in throwing the word "euphoria" around about this substance - even with the "mild" qualifier. A definate (but minor) mood lift, yes, but euphoric? no - more of a contentment than anything else), quite social (although the only social outlet I had was IMing a friend as I was doing a solo test as I always do before allowing my friends to experiment). A worrying heat in the head and chest (went quite red) for about an hour. Mild total-body-discomfort about 3 hours in, lasting about an hour. The whole "trip" lasted about 7hrs all up, although it really is hard to gauge a start and end time for this. 


Will I do it again? Of course! (there's more than one dose in a packet![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)) But in the future it will be with friends, which will hopefully bring out the euphoria that other people have reported.

Lately I have been going to some various "clubs" around here, with a friend, basically, just to get out and have some fun, meet cool people, get laid.. etc.


We are trying to figure out what to order, throw out a little cash for some fun.  Considering that most of the "E" around here, is either weak or mixed with something else, paying for a small amount of a "RC" really isn't expensive compared to the shitty E lately.


If we are paying a, what would be considered "good" price, for two or three E tablets that contain so little we have to eat two at once, then maybe a third.. sucks..


I took a total of 3 "E" tabs recently (spread out), my friend did the same, and I would keep thinking to myself, "damn, i wish I was on IAP" while at a few clubs.  I had energy up the ass, we wanted to go to as many places that were still open after 2am, but I kept thinking how much more "social" IAP seemed to be.  Only at higher doses though.  We mostly just stood around watching people, very calm and all, but just euphoric and "content" not trying to talk to new people.


I was thinking about methylone, although I read that it doesn't stimulate you much, IAP didnt seem to either.  Instead of a speedy stimulation, I felt more of a "happy social" kind of motivation, that would motivate me by some other mechanism.. maybe just the huge serotonin release.  So I am considering methylone, it is a little cheaper, and I wonder, if it is too "sedating" or makes me or my friend unmotivated in a rave/club/females type setting, if taking an amphetamine like dexedrine with it would help with that.. I will have to read and see if i can find any trip reports with this mix.  I have never tried methylone but from what I read so far it looks interesting.  I KNOW IAP would be just incredible for any social setting for me, at a large dose of course, but for some reason the duration of the extreme euphoria/horny/wowness only lasted maybe 3 hours or so.  My friend only tried it once but the dose was just too low..and maybe I just react good to this stuff for some reason.


Anyway I suppose I should write a report of my experiences, although I was around some people for part of them, I haven't tried it in a public/social setting where there are a lot of pretty females that I do not know ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)  So if i come across some more IAP I will be saving it for this kind of situation, for sure.. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

>*do you know if the effects were at all different when smoked or not?* 


i heard of a group that found it to be quite effective when smoked.


it was tested solo and also tryed mixed w cannabis


15mg iap between 3 people and all had a very increased heart rate (not to a troubling point) and energy.  everyone was very talkative and it felt good to be in a social environment. everyone experienced visual trailing and lights starbursting. 2 even reported patterning in OEVs.


this was only increased when done with cannabis.  it turns into more of a cannabis trip.  


this is basically what would happen if taken sublingually in the proper dose, but doesnt peak until 1.5-2 hours and it can last for quite a while.   it  kicks in faster smoked, but it didnt totally peak until 1 hour after smoking and only lasts 4 hours-ish.

People have told so different "stories" about the effects of IAP. Personally, I haven't noticed any emphatic feelings and euphoria, and IAP makes me feel rather stony than stimulated. At the first time I did notice some mood lifting ("euphoria") for a while and music sounded great but the two other experiences were different.

i don't think it lowers inhibitions. sex on it was fantastic, but i was with someone who i'm in love with in sober life. it didn't really increase desire or physical attraction, just brought out an enhanced sense of intimacy and affection (which indirectly augmented the physical dimension as well).


edited to say that i don't think iap is any more remarkable in this regard than, say, a low-dose 2c*. i've found that many psychedelics have this same potential.

I tried IAP today, 50mg. I got virtually no effect, and what I did get was not interesting or even enjoyable. BO-RING. Thank god I got this as a free sample and didn't waste my money on it.


Come up was slow, as described on erowid trip reports, and at first I was cautiously optimistic. But peak effects were, how to describe it, like being a little drunk but without any euphoria. My head felt slooshy and dizzy but no nausea (thank goodness; now then I would be REALLY pissed off), and my vision was spinny and bouncy. Almost no other visual effects, and totally zero psychedelic effects. In fact if anything this feels like an ANTI-psychedelic, in that introspection and enjoyment of external stimulation was actually less than when plain sober and in a good mood.


If I'm ever feeling really bored and a little crazy I may try a higher dose of IAP someday just to see (trip reports do seem to vary quite a bit even at the same dose), but it's at the bottom of my list.


Onward and upward!

God, to me 50mg is a "low dose".


I guess everyone reacts differently, but it seems like there is a certain threshold with this stuff, where, anything under xxmg will do shit, but higher than xxmg is ...groovy!  Literally its like if I take..25-35-45mg, i will get no good effects at all, maybe a sense of a 'some drug' is in me, but if i take 60-70-80mg+, its totally different.


I dont know if i just react good, but yeah, when I take around 100mg thats when the magic really hits me.  Euphoria sounds like an understatement, it definitely feels like the "serotonin" rush like MDMA, MDA, Methylone, and other similar drugs.  As for visual activity, mostly very VERY VIVID colors, and some tracers.. a clear headed, mind-expanded effect that seems really similar to 5-meo-dmt to me (even though 5meo-dmt is not that visual for me, its possibly my favorite psychedelic, i don't know why I have passed that one up for so long, i have much to say about that, but, not in a thread for IAP!)


I've tried smoking it, and it works, you can get the ^^ above effects from smoking a small amount (vaporizing it) but it lasts much shorter.

First few times I tried 5-meo-dmt (smoked),  i thought wow, its a lot like smoking IAP.


I have not smoked enough IAP to reach the intense euphoric rush from taking 100mg orally.  It was very much like MDMA or maybe more like MDA, minus the 'physical stimulation'.  It never lasted more than..3 hours maybe...or maybe 3.5..max..  Definitely no 'crash' with this - at least my experience.


I mean, i'd gladly take Methylone over IAP, but also, i'd gladly lend "my trash can" to throw out all that nasty bad IAP ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

^^Interesting. The trip reports I read were mostly at 50mg and sounded like people were getting decent effects at that dose, plus I seem to recall one or two reporting that >60mg got uncomfortable. But you have given me encouragement to go ahead and "experiment" with increased doses, instead of filing away this stuff as a novelty.


I'll let you know how it goes....

Ok, I read somewhere where someone posted that, there are two isomers of IAP, and that one is the active one, and the other is not - but not only not, it actually antagonizes the effect of the 'good' isomer.


So, I wonder if that means a lot for people's different reactions.  I know for me at higher doses only, it was very good, but it only lasted a few hours max.. I'm guessing most of the IAP you would buy ends up coming from the same 'main' supplier anyway, i'm assuming racemic, but maybe people metabolize one or the other differently? 


Or maybe different batches of IAP from different times contain more of this or more of that.  Who knows..  I dont know which isomer, but if there was just the plain 'active' one available some day, that might be nice.. who knows.. ![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

My last IAP experience didn't last a few hours but probably half a day (I fell asleep after 8.5 hours of taking it and my pupils were still large)!


There is very fine IAP powder and coarser powder in the market. And who knows if some verdors put something else in IAP (at least time to time) to strenghten the effects.

I will have to say I agree with many of the above statements for the most especially the erotic bit and Ill go ahead an add my part here ....


This may sound a bit strange but this stuff reminds me a little of ghb in its ability to tease.


Every time Ive ever taken ghb Ive been somewhat enticed to take more. However there is that hard but tough to anticipate point between having a good time(erotic-euphoric) and/or bad time(passing out cold).


With IAP for the good time(50-75mgs) you get this oncoming feel good roll that never really fully develops. On top of that the initial alerts take nearly 2 hours to come on. These two factors leave one reaching for more doses however the results of the feeling reached by going farther(100-125mgs) leave the IAP user with side effects that far surpass the benefits. For me and my partner these effects included spastic muscle twitching, very high temperature, cold chills, and a feeling of being borderline poisoned. This was a complete reverse of our previous experience(50mgs)which was quite pleasant and erotic.


I still consider this an interesting substance despite its quirks. Perhaps it has some synergistic effects as yet unseen. By itself however it seems to be a bit lacking ...

**nice but uninteresting**


50mg of IAP HCl (margin of error +/- 10% I fear) produced positive, active and social mood, generally feeling good, to the extent that if people were regularly taking this and getting the same effect, telemarketers would have an easy job. So actually in some way a forced and false happiness. Some alcohol was consumed over the night and I assume the IAP took some edge off the alcohol resulting me not feeling drunk at all, considering I should have at those amounts, although small. 


Stimulation was just about non-existent, the substance was ingested at 18:15 or so and sleeping felt like a serious option around 02:00, that being t+8, but having a high sugar, moderate caffeine drink helped a bit. Maybe I was a bit low on energy after drinking that darn alcohol and its effect dropping off, not eating that much (felt way too odd -- it's normal for me). Around 04:00 walking was easy, no tiredness in that way, went to sleep at about 06:00, t+12 that is, felt just as tired as I should have after being up for 20 hours. I'd say pupil dilation lasted longer than the main effects, but on the other hand mood was significantly up for a day or two after.


Overall, for me IAP definitely did not feel like something people would go crazy about if someone pressed pills and sold it to ravers, actually I doubt if someone with no experience of lsd- or mdma-type drugs would even notice anything except having a great time if someone put this into her drink without telling her. There was some odd feeling but nothing clearly wrong that could not be ignored. Since I am more into psychedelics proper, meaning LSD and the works, IAP by itself seems quite uninteresting. I also doubt if it would be any good as a party drug because of the totally uncritical attitude IAP promoted in me, and that is a lot, so although benevolence is generally a good thing, IAP might make people outright gullibly happy. I myself have better ideas for combining drugs and having fun, but for the time being, I refuse to recommend any drugs to anyone in public... ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tried IAP for the first time at 50mgs today.  I have mixed feelings.  On one hand, I enjoyed the social effect, yet it made me feel somewhat dissociated at the same time.  There was some euphoria, but it was never overwelming, and there were also visuals.  The chemical felt hard on my body and mind towards the end, and the experience felt like it was very drawn out.  ..Interesting experience that I may write about, but I doubt I'll try again.  I'll stick to MDA and Methylone for entactogenic trips.  ..Oh, and there was alot of jaw clenching throughout the experience, and I haven't got that with many drugs at all other than higher doses of Amphetamine/Methamphetamine that I've done.

I had an oppurtunity to observe a rank amateur group dosing on this stuff. They took totally eyeballed doses (and I piped up about the hazards of taking such a unknown research chemical). ![:p](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f61b.png) 


Around 5 people were unstimulated, some complaining that the drugs weren't doing much, they were content just to sit around with massively dialated pupils. They were remarkably quiet considering reported social aspects of it. I've seen one person on IAP before who was silent for about 4 hours.

One person was rather energised, exclaiming it was better than E and quite thrilled they'd found a drug that worked - E surposedly didn't do much for them normally. One guy had somewhat overwhelming rushes with a unsettling feeling in his gut, and complained of swings between hot and cold, and was worried he'd poisoned himself, smoking weed seem to make him quite panicky. He had said he came off SSRIs about 14 days prior, which might have a had a small influence here. But the pricklyness he felt all over sounded like what VictorBorge had. 


Reaction to drugs like MDMA/MDA varies, but i'd say IAP is more unpredictable as opposed to just unexplored. I hope this dodgy shit never gets sold in pills, we'll see more serotonin syndrome deaths. I've read that a whole lot turned up in pills siezed in aus/nz... I can't substantiate that rumour at the momment, although I'm sure I did see a reference to a article reccently.


So we know of people taking a bit over 100mg, anyone seen reports of higher doses?

^^^


I couldn't imagine anyone that enjoys pressed pills enjoying IAP.  There were plenty of +'s for me, but there were many -'s as well, and the experience was very "strange" to say the least.  It was long and drawn out, providing no real energy.  I was quite stimulated, but I felt stoned at the same time.  There was a cool social effect during the onset, which carried throughout the trip, yet there was a strange dissociative feeling at about two hours into the trip.  I don't think you can draw any conclusions from what you experienced.  Those were unknown doses..  Anyone that's tried IAP will tell you that experiences will vary with doses of +/- 10mgs, and there is no way you could tell the amount of powder difference between 50mgs and 60mgs.

It's been a while since I tried IAP, but these experiences sound pretty similar to my own. They could also be describing my experience with PMEA, which I thought was quite like IAP, though much easier on my body. 110-115mg of both chemicals was enough for what felt like a "full" experience of each one's effects, but at that dose, IAP had me worried for my heart rate and blood pressure, whereas PMEA almost had me drowsy and very calm.


I don't really see the value in either of these, though. I agree with Piper, I'll stick to MDxA and methylone. Mmmmm, methylone.

People are seeming to really love Methylone.  I too see it as a very useful entactogen.  I like it because it isn't anywhere near as overwelming as my other favorite entactogen, MDA.  I like going on walks on Methylone, whereas with MDA, I wobble around in one place, rolling my eyes in the back of my head because the euphoria makes me feel like my whole body and mind is in an orgasmic state.  I can't say I cared for IAP much at all.

To be honest, if I ever use IAP again, I am only going to take 25mgs.  50mgs was way too "strange."  I just didn't enjoy the places it was taking me for the most part.  I believe over 100mgs, it would become extremely uncomfortable, if not dangerous.

Unless it is freebased, it cannot be smoked. It is water soluble, as it is an amphetamine, so it can be snorted. Be careful when snorting any research chem, though.

I recently obtained 100mg 99% pure IAP. Is there anyway to do a test for purity or just to ensure it is actually IAP?


You cant base your decision to try the drug on a few bad reports. First off, everyone reacts differently to different drugs. Over twenty factors help decide how the experience will be. Lastly, its not even 75% conclusive that these people took pure or at least 99% pure IAP. 


It would be like people reporting on MDMA. Come on most of MDMA is not pure. **different people have different preference** One user may take pure MDMA and have a perfect experience and hate it! So dont go and base your decision on a few people who prefer other experiences. Bleh! Just a note.


Back to the topic

Im taking my IAP sometime this weekend. I dont have a scale so im going to take the 100mg bag and "eye" it into four even piles. Which should be 25mg. I will take the 25mg the first time and share my experience. The next weekend I will take 50-75mg and share my experience. 

I will also try smoke some because half of you say yes it can be smoked effectively and others say it cannot. So I will waste 15mg on smoking and may not be able to report higher doses until I buy some more IAP. Shame, someone provide a scientific answer on whether or not it can be smoked please.


I will provide an honest account sometime between June 16th-19th of a 25mg IAP experience. I will provide the 50-75mg experience report about a week to ten days afterward. 


**Another important question** 

I have a pretty strong opiate tolerance will it affect my IAP or adderall experiences?


I will be taking some amphetamine this weekend as well most likely prior to the IAP experience. Just my situation!

Alright, for my first post to this board i would like to try to contribute to this fine and dandy thread.


My brother, girlfriend and I all got the chance to sample some IAP that we had got **[Edit]**.  We started out with about a 50mg dose, now we made the mistake of eating prior to injestion, so the come up was slower then I had expected, it ended up being about an hour and a half till we were feeling minorr effects.  So at the hour and a half point since we werent feeling what we were expecting to feel, so we ended up eating another 30mg.  About 15 minutes later we were feeling a strong body load, sorta like i would say a pain killer like high, the urge to sit and do nothing overtook us and we watched a few movies ( i recommend evolution to any psyconauts out there on anything fun ) now we went into this thinking that it was gonna be alot like rolling, and after a while of getting used to this new chemical we found oursleves saying that this is what a molly (pure mdma ) should be like.  We were impressed with the duration of the IAP which was over the 8 hour mark ( remeber we also boosted at 1.5hrs ) we never at any point had any jaw clenching, the nystagmus was experienced by my gf at some points and the only person to have any real energy was my brother, who at one point walked to the corner store and back in about 20 min. After the 8 hours my gf and I went to bed and about an hour later we finally went to sleep ( btw, sex was awesome, the body high seemed to get really intense at some points even at the 8 hour mark ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

I tend to find that IAP takes at least 2 hours to come on.  So it's a pretty bad idea to be re-dosing at the 1.5h mark!


I really wouldn't suggest mixing this with other PEA's.  I mixed a dose with a MDMA pill and on the come up off the E my heart rate and BP shot right up.  I thought I was gonna pop for a while!


Not one for mixing as far as I'm conserned.  Which is a pity as it's effects are pretty nice but it's a bit short on the psychadelic front....

**Not psychedelic but usefully! ...maybe move the**


thread to 0ther Drugs....or MY post to tips??!?


500mg of IAP dissolved in 20cc sterile water. Placed in vial via Whatman filter.


1st Tried  100mg IM. Slight sting, not very irritating.


Within 5-10 minutes and core temperature is @ 101f. Definitely serotogenic-quite possibly neurotoxic @ this dose/ route. Fells like time I took 3000mg Dexphenfluramine- untoward pupil dilation. STRONG boundary shifts in visual field. Bittersweet sub-psychedelic effect ala TMFPP.  Sweating and chills. Intoxication ala Et0H- gait problems. Overall, quite unpleasant.


25mg IV= NICE.  Amphetamine/ Smart drug. ..got register and pushed in 25mg. Nice clean ether taste on injection. Clear headed, energetic, minimal peripheral effects- less rush than Crystal.  Focused, energetic and relaxed...just want to "be". Doing housework is actually fun, slow, organized and productive. No desire to incrementalize dose.

**IAP - First time - 50mgs**


ingested 50mg couple weeks ago - pretty strong gastro-intestinal upset - had to use the bathroom 4-5 times in 8 hours.  Almost felt like puking a few times, but didn't.  Not really fun, disassociative-like high.  


This chem really blew my pupils out  - 24 hours later I still had huge pupils and blood vessels in the whites of my eyes looked very red and distended.


Slight tracer-like visuals and fuzzy/color distortions.  


Nothing like MDMA - the best RC out there now is 2c-e - really awesome.

**IAP experience summary**


I've tried this substance 10 times now. I find that 50 mg, taken dissolved into some booze works rather well for me. I also find that the sweet spot doesn't really show itself with IAP alone. When combined with alcohol and cannabis the effect is GREATLY pronounced. I find that it alows me to drink larger than usual amounts of hard alcohol without reaching my usual stuporslurstublestate when i drink that much booze on it's own. And I don't get sleepy either from drinking alot with IAP. Usually I get tired after 2 beers. ("pussy")


 The combined effect of the 3 substances for me is a rather enjoyable and employable experience. I have been able to come up with tons and tons of really good and inspired ideas musically, artistically, and while writing with great ease and rapidity while on the IAP Trinity. I find that the combo is indeed a very social experience. Anxiety levels drop way down for me. My mood becomes one of joy and ease. I usually feel a very spiritual/empathic type of experience in relation to the living beings around me.


 I become highly conversational at near-manic pase. It sorta bugged by pals out how fast I was operating one time at a concert, but it was awesome for me. I felt like I had some serious Cranius Maximus goin' on. I found myself`often with lots of energy and wanting to move around or dance. Music sounded amazing to me, highly pronounced and made much more psyhcedelicly yummier. A John Zorn show I saw totally blew my gourd wide open with this combination stewing in mi cabesa. The experience each time seemed to last a rather long time too, especially if you are sensitive to feeling stuff, which I believe myself to be. It lingers at a slowing diminishing level for probably 8-10 hours from the point of ingestion until I can truly claim to be baseline, in my experience.


And BTW, my drink of choice with this stuff is usually a bunch of long island iced teas. Just for the record since they have a bunch of different boozes mixed in 'em and I really believe that different alcohols have different effects, which intern can effect the overall Bitches Brew you got inside of you. The word "drunk" is as descriptive in my mind as "tripping". Not very.


As always: YMMV

I tried combining 65 mg IAP with 5-6 drops liquid LSD (not sure if the last drop stuck to the rim of the dropper or landed on the sugar cube...) on a recent camping trip in VT. The results were not quite what I was aiming for. I was hoping to land in some sort of candyflipping type experience but the results were not that different from taking LSD by itself. There was a pronounced come on for the IAP, I felt more of a rush/chest glow type feeling ala MDMA, but it was a bit disconcerting and not all that enjoyable. After about 2 hours into the experience I was hardly able to discern that I had taken IAP along with the LSD.

^^ IME, IAP is about 1/4 as interesting as methylone. The come-up effects of IAP are VERY stimulative, in a flushed / high blood pressure kind of way. It reminded me more than anything of taking a large dose of niacin. A great big prickly facial flush with virtually no mental effects.


The plateau effects of IAP were a 1-2 hour mood lift on the order of 50-75mg of methylone. Not really approaching entactogenic status. Pleasant but not anywhere near worth the side effects. This was with just over 100mg. Lower doses had no discernible effect at all besides nystagmus.


Whereas with methylone, the side effects manifest mostly as excess energy, and on the comedown as minor exhaustion, and the peak effects are quite heavenly and truly entactogenic. 


I love methylone, but I will never bother with IAP again. If I received some for free, I would probably throw it away.

As far as I am concerned, they are nothing alike.  50mgs of IAP was enough for me to realize I really didn't like the compound.  It was quite "strange" and had many mild negative side effects that made it feel "dirty."  The experience is very long and drawn out, while Methylone has to be one of the "cleanest" feeling drugs I've ever taken.  The effects of Methylone are very apparent, though not too powerful, but the effects of IAP were always somewhat in the background.  I could never really get a grasp on what the chemical was doing to me.  There was a significant visual swirling for me as well.  I mean, it wasn't a total waste, but it is the first research chemical that I've tried and wouldn't consider trying again.

I dont know for sure but I can tell you when I took 100mgs I experienced classic symptoms of serotonin syndrome.  My legs were doin all kinds of spastic cramps and twitching.  Also when I went w/o a blanket I was FREEZING cold and with a blanket I was drenched in sweat.  It was horrible.  If I had anymore I would throw it away.

IAP on its own, as said before, is not much fun. It's hard on the body and a little disorientating.

The solution is easy, if there's access to some other chemicals and a little common sense.

First, don't take to much, it's an inhibitor and releaser of the three main neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine and noradrenalin). I would say, don't go above 50 mgs 

For the bodily, symptaticomimetic overstimulation, just take a betablocker, like propranolol, or metoprolol.

For the light disorientating edge, GHB does wonders. Actually GHB does the trick. It gives a good synergy with the IAP bodily aneastetic and yet hypereastetic feeling (if you know what I mean). And the GHB gives, along with the IAP a long, mellow euporia. But be aware to not overdose on GHB, for the IAP takes a long, long time, so several doses need to be taken. Over 24 hours afterward I dosed 32,5 mg IAP, I took 1 shot alcohol, and the mellow feeling came back. But alcohol and GHB don't mix and alcohol dulls and prostitutes the mind in that dominant, toxic way that makes it one of the  most dreadful drugs known to mankind. (Sorry for that lithany...) 

A benzodiazepin (temazepam in my case) was needed for sleep. Again, be careful with the GHB interaction.

So all in all, a little complicated, but then, very, yes very rewarding indeed.

I tried some of this indanylamphetamine tonight. Not sure how much I ate, 80-120mg or so in a gelcap. Very strange drug, if I try it again it will be with amphetamine or methamphetamine, it really needs some dopamine euphoria to make it productive.


The first hour I noticed some weird time distortion.. dilation and contraction and the intensity of moments seemed exaggerated. My hands were also kind of cold, tingly, and sparkly in a good way, not like vasoconstriction but just a tactile sensation.


The drug this most resembles to me is Paxil. Much different though. Reminds me a tiny bit of a DXM hangover without the blurry vision, and dulled senses, but rather with heightened senses instead.


The main effect I noticed, without having to stretch for words to describe it, was incredibly enhanced creativity. A minor, but noticable effect, was the impairment of my logic facilities such as I would get from drinking a little bit of alcohol.


There was no dopaminergic stimulation at all. No teeth clenching, nystagmus, euphoria, empathy, or serious energy boost was noted. I was bouncing my leg uncontrollably for a little bit somewhere around the 7th hour. I'm still feeling the effects as I type it up but they mostly wore off after about 8 hours. Around that point I took a long walk and most of the walk I was yawning uncontrollably. I'm at the 10 hour mark now and there's still some rainbow colors bleeding out of the color white on my monitor, but I'm about ready for bed. Paxil also gave me similar bleeding rainbow visuals on white surfaces when I tried it, and it made me yawn a lot. I honestly think I could have passed out even on the peak of this drug if I had tried to sleep.

IAP ought to deserve going down as a footnote in the history of experimental psychoactives, but it likely won't get even *that!* ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif). While I haven't tried it, it sounds to me similar to its friend, 2-aminoindan, which is interesting but thoroughly useless.

Thanks to a beautiful friend, I managed to acquire some antiquated IAP. My interest in it was piqued after having tried MDAI and found it very interesting.


I took 19mg (+/- 3) rectally. Although first alerts were felt within 20mins or so, the buildup was extremely sluggish and took about 1.5h to completely manifest whatever subtle effects it had to offer. 


I found its peak/plateau to be basically indistinguishable from the *comeup* classic phenethylamine psychedelics such as 2C-T-2, 2C-I, TMA-2, MDA...etc. I wouldn't say it was closer to MDA than any of the others - for me, all phenethylamine psychedelics share the same "signature" - that is, a sense of "pressure" in a circle around the head, in the temples, the neck, and the shoulders (the "MDA Cape"), and a feeling of general heavy-headedness and a certain tingle on the palate (inside the mouth). There was very slight colour enhancement (and I mean *very* slight - on par with Methamphetamine's very slight colour enhancement). There was also some stimulation, a lot of it felt to be peripheral, and occasional suggestions of anxiety, as is the case (again) with any phen comeup. There was maybe a bit of empathy, but nothing much to write home about. 


This state (a solid ++, as is common with other entactogens/empathogens at low doses) dragged on for much of the next 5-6 hours or so, after which sleep was not only easy, but almost forced. 


Although I am tempted to try it at higher doses to see if it "blooms" anywhere, I am very frightened by what seems to be a heavy bodyload. 


As its chemical structure may hint, this is really a classic phenethylamine in all aspects, and has very little in relation to the aminoindanes.

Ninjabump!


I remember some interesting posts about combining IAP with MDPV or MPH. Apparently, when combined with dopamine releasers (amphetamine), these non-neurotoxic SSRAs exhibited toxicity, but when combined with dopamine reuptake inhibitors (MPH, MDPV, cocaine), they did not. I have some MPH laying around and this seems like a great way to get some use out of it, considering I don't really like the effects of methylphenidate alone (too antisocial/kinda angry). Reading the reports here pretty much made me think "needs more dopamine" (well everything needs more dopamine), so it seems appropriate.


Any experience with this combo? Ideas?

I thought I'd bump this as a well known and trusted UK vendor is currently getting this synthed as an MDAI replacement.


Sounds like it might be even better than MDAI when combo'd with a stim. I Doubt is has the same thereputic value though ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png).


I'm also going to assume that this chem will lack the non-neurotoxic bonus that MDAI and other SSRA's (on their own) have. It looks as though it's probably metabolised to alpha-methyldopamine, as well as being a weak, yet still significant dopamine releaser.

Why do you say that? Why will the indane ring be opened up and hydroxylated? It should be just as non-neurotoxic as MDAI as far as I can see.

And it feels as if it is not toxic. Not to say my experience has anything to say about real neurotoxicity, but it does not even induce hangovers. Due to 5-HT depletion, or tryptophan hydroxylase inhibition, or toxic metabolites, or whatever.

My bad, my field of expertise is not biochemistry. Does that mean HMA is required as a metabolite to eventually end up with α-methyldopamine?


Can anyone suggest how IAP would be metabolised?


With IC50 values of 82 nM, 1,848 nM, and 849 nM for serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline respectively, I guess it's unlikely that enough dopamine would end up in the wrong vesicles to cause enough trouble when MAO gets wind of it. So perhaps it is more non-neurotoxic than I originaly thought, but it's still likely to be somewhat more neurotixic than MDAI, even if only *slightly*.

MDAI felt like a nasty SSRI and its aftereffects lingered for weeks. IAP is a lot better than MDAI.

I've been on SSRI's in the past, eventually giving up and going cold turkey (zzzzzzzzzzzzap). Since then, the serenic effect of SRA's, selective or not just hasn't been the same.


Anyway, MDAI felt WAY different to SSRI's, except maybe for my first citalopram dose which gave a comfy warm head feeling for a short while, after that it was just occaisional mood swings, lethargy and no sex drive...


MDAI, if not used too regularly was just a gentle snuggly kinda drug. Which didn't seem to destroy my sex drive. Niether did it make me particularly horny, but the subtle tactile enhanchement got me wishing I had a female round to fool around with. And I know from experience that serotonin releasers are great for delaying orgasm as well as increasing tatctile sensation. And MDAI, having negligable stimulant effects doesn't really restrict blood flow to certain places. MDMA is one of the hardest drugs to get it up on. Mephedrone and Methylone took some work initially, but being high on the dopamine side, you couldn't help but have the best erection induucing thoughts to get you going (Mephedrone especially)


I never had any bad after effects from MDAI (on it's own) eitther. And I don't think I've taken any more than 500 mg in a single evening, If that! Being non-neurotoxic, any negative after effects would be down to serotonin depletion (and I guess down-regulation), rather than a combination of serotonin depletion and sertotonergic neruotoxitcy (such as with MDMA or Mephedrone). Taking regular 5-htp, or even better, l-tryptophan (without any other amino acids) can quickly get your 5-HT levels back after using an SSRA. In the case of neurotoxicity, it might feel somewhat more debilitating and take a bit longer to get your brain to recover... But then there's still the on going debate as to whether this MDxx neurotoxicity is long term. A little off topic but I'll just throw this in


I do especially like the recent article in Addiction that compares the cognitive skills of ecstacy users against non-users. The study found "no short- or long-term differences in cognitive skills in the test group (users) versus the control group (non-users)".


If you're bashing loads of MDAI, or IAP, then a high tryptophan diet will probably do more for you in the days followining than if you were to take something that actually causes neurotoxic damage which, will take longer to heal. Although neuroprotective agents like selegiline are still a good investment. It'll be also interesting to see if those folk that got awesome potentiation of MDAI whilst on Selegiline can get as similiar effect from IAP.


I know a lot of people round my way don't understand that the human brain really doesn't store THAT much serotonin compared to say dopamine, or noradrenaline. so even with non neurotoxic serotonin releasing agents, it can be easy to run out of serotonin, and couple that with acute Desensitisation (depending on how much you use and for how long), it could result in MDMA style suicide tuesdays.  But at least your brain isn't fried, and a few good tryptophan rich meals can't go a miss.


I can't wait to give IAP a bash though and try and pick up on what astenu is saying. MDAI does have much less serotonin releasing ability than MDMA or IAP whilst being quite effective at inhibiting it's reuptake, so I can see  where astenu is coming from with the SSRI comparison. I still personally find MDAI to have an amazing thereputic value that totally blows all SSRI's away. We'd have been better with MDMAI, which theoretically would be a far more efficient  SSRA. Much more like MDMA's serotonin release. Cleaner with less of an SSRI feel whilst retaning MDAI's lack of DA or NE activity. Shame the only vendor to "source" some got ripped off with something that tasted rather piperziney...

I should have some of this on the way soon. Very interesting monoamine release values, looks much more intriguing than MDAI to me.


Very much excited for my sample. If there's enough, I plan to experiment with this on its own, and in combination with a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (not a releaser) - if not I'll just give this a try on its own for now, though either way if this is as interesting as I expect it'll probably be part of my next major RC order :D

Apparently, when combined with dopamine releasers (amphetamine), these non-neurotoxic SSRAs exhibited toxicity, but when combined with dopamine reuptake inhibitors (MPH, MDPV, cocaine), they did not. I have some MPH laying around and this seems like a great way to get some use out of it, considering I don't really like the effects of methylphenidate alone (too antisocial/kinda angry). Reading the reports here pretty much made me think "needs more dopamine" (well everything needs more dopamine), so it seems appropriate.

Exactly what I was thinking, and I have plans to combine with MDPV or Ethylphenidate. All in separate attempts of course.

Now that I have gotten accustomed with 4-FMA and know howm much euphoria long lasting euphoria it can give, I'm so so so excited to play with IAP! If the "IAP + amphetamine = MDA" report is anything to go by, then 4-FMA and IAP should be ***FUCKING BRUTAL***.


Obviously I'm excited to try IAP on its own first to get a feel for the effects, duration, dose etc.... but just the thought of this combination is getting me high! I fully expect it it to be messy!

Methiopropamine is a monoamine releaser rather than a reuptake inhibitor, so I'd expect adding it to MDAI would cause it to be neurotoxic just like MDMA, MDA etc. The reason I'm looking at mixing it with MDPV or EPH is they are all dopamine reuptake inhibitors, and as such the same risk is far less likely, and it might be possible to avoid neurotoxicity completely while still having an awesome experience. :D

A list of some reuptake inhibitors: MDPV, Ethylphenidate, Methylphenidate (Ritalin), Cocaine

Some releasers: Amphetamine, Methamphetamine, MDMA, MDA, Methiopropamine (MPA)


I've heard it mixes well with MPA but this is likely going to be as damaging as rolling (taking MDMA) so I wouldn't advise doing it more than once a month. IAP + a reuptake inhibitor imo would be a lot less damaging and could be done more often.

Jesusgreen you're wrong. The neurotoxic properties of MDMA are mediated by [2,5-Bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836). This metabolite forms under the presence of high 5-HT efflux (to raise body temperature) and formation of Alpha-Methyldopamine. MDAI + Amphetamine is neurotoxic because it meets both criteria but MDAI + 2-FMA won't be. The same is true for IAP. Pairing it with Amp or Meth will be neurotoxic but not with any dopaminergic that doesn't form Alpha-Methyldopamine.

^Shit... I've been wondering what the neurotoxic metabolites of alpha-methyldopamine were... and it turns out that it requires glutathione?!


Well there goes my normal routine of supplementing with fucking N-Acetylcysteine!!! Glutathione is a damn important anti-oxidant that MDMA does a good job of draining. I guess it's back to taking a handfull of 1000 mg Vit C pills out with me!


But you're right, that flourine in 2-F(M)A will prevent the production of this metabolite! Explains a lot ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif). 4-F(M)A should be protected too. Not sure how 3-F(M)A will fair though? I'm not a fan of 3-FA so I won't be using that (not seen 3-FMA anywhere). 


If I want productivity I'll use 2-FA/2-FMA. If I want speedy euphoria I'll go with 4-FMA. For gentle/subtle euphoria or a euphoric stim for when I need to be able to appear "normal", I'll use 4-FA. 4-FA doesn't really combo well in my experience. It was disappointing with MDAI, although I hear redosing with MDMA is good, so maybe IAP might be okay.


I'm not entirely sure how much dopamine *release* contributes to neurotoxicity though. Data on 4-FA and 4-MAR suggest that it might not be as significant as we have previously believed

Tried this last night, it was a bit ho hum. Setting: watching Olympics opening ceremony. Previously consumed drugs: several lines of MPA and a couple of pints of beer. Dose 36mg weighed, I decided to insuflate it because I had eaten a meal shortly before hand and I am an impatient sort when it comes to stims. My partner dabbed 28mg weighed as she is generally more sensitive to stims than I am. Within 2 minutes of snorting I felt flushed and after 15 minutes the body load was significant and uncomfortable, I had to sit it out. It reminded me of the way 5-meo DALT can kick in. After 30 minutes the body load diminished and I became aware of a chilled pyschedelic head space. I was couch locked most of the time and absorbed in the TV without becoming bored after an hour and a half of parading atheletes. It was more of a 'stoning' high and there was no empathy, desire to talk or euphoria present. After 2 hours I took  a bump of MPA to see what effect that would have and it did increase the sociability somewhat. My partner said that she hadn't really come up so after an hour and a half I gave her another 12mg weighed which she dabbed again. She did get a bit more bouncy but it may have been the wine she was consuming.


Conclusions: snorting seems to be a bad idea, the come up is intense and uncomfortable. It does need a dopamine supplement, MPA was all that I had to hand. I didn't find it at all sociable and would have struggled to maintain composure in public during the first hour. I thought about taking another bump after a couple of hours but it didn't seem to be worth the effort. Maybe a larger dose on an empty stomach might have led to a better experience. Total duration was around 4 hours and I took an etizolam after 5 hours and slept straight away.

So as I already took serotonin releasers this weekend at an event (5-APB + 6-APB) I won't be trying this just yet, maybe in 2-4 weeks time.


I'm going to be going for just taking IAP/5-APDI on its own first before I try combining it with anything. If I've read all the reports correctly it seems the ideal dose range is around 40-60mg, with dosing much higher than that resulting in a lot more euphoria but also effects that seem to resemble serotonin syndrome or something similar.


Due to only having a small sample of the stuff, and wanting to get a minimum of 2 experiences out of it but ideally 3+ I was thinking of just taking 30mg. Anyone tried it at this dosage and is it worthwhile? Or should I maybe take 50mg and save a lower 30mg dose for when I'm testing it in combination? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Would combining MDAI with ethylphenidate/IAP keep the low neurotoxic levels of MDAI alone? After researching ethylphenidate, it seems easily prone to abuse due to compulsive redosing, but maybe it would be different when combined with MDAI. Does IAP have a similar proneness to abuse as ethylphenidate?

IAP + Ethylphenidate + MDPV (rather small doses of each) felt somewhere between Methylone and MDMA for me. Then I added speed and it was more like MDMA just longer. I think the full effects of the IAP lasted like 12-14 hours ![o_O](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f635.png)


Now I'm on MDMA :D ![<3](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/24.gif)

People need to stop combining SRAs with DRIs. There are reasons it doesn't feel good.


A. 5HT2A upregulates D2. DRIs increase dopamine irrespectively, releasers tend to release far less dopamine in D2 populated regions of the brain. This is the main reason why drugs like MDPV and Ritalin are more paranoia inducing than Amphetamine or Meth. With releasers dopamine rises unselectively and because D2 is upregulated this compounds the paranoid feelings.


B. 5HT2A + 5HT2C + 5HT6 inhibit dopamine  release. Releasing agents release dopamine anyway but if endogenous release is limited by activation of these receptors then reuptake inhibitors are less effective.


C. 5HT1A inhibits norepinephrine release. See above.


And contrary to popular belief SRA + DRA (excluding Amophetamine and Methamphetamine) is not neurotoxic. This study: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1726189](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1726189) only combined MDAI with Amphetamine. 


MDMA style neurotoxicity is caused by A. The production of Alpha-Methyl-Dopamine (a byproduct of MDMA/MDA/Amp/Meth Exclusively) and B. elavated cranial temperature (caused by massive serotonin release). [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9128836)


Therefore combining MDAI/IAP with Amphetamine WILL be neurotoxic. However combining it with 4-FA, 2-FMA, MPA, Mephedrone, Cathinone or any other dopamine releasing agent will not be neurotoxic.

^ Yep, you're right there. I would certainly not advise anyone doing what I did tonight, it was a silly mistake, but thankfully I've had a good night, just means it's going to be a long time before I take any serotonergics again. I'm even considering waiting until New Years.

Wow, that is great news - I can imagine all those substances will feel much better with some added seretonin :D But even if there is no added neurotoxicity, its gonna dry seretoin quite a lot, right?

MDAI + Meth/Amphetamine is neurotoxic.


MDAI + Anything else isn't.


According to current research anyway.

Well, the main study confirming such used a DRI with with limited overall efficacy in increasing dopamine (GBR-12935, IIRC).  There are are thus some limitations in generalizability to methylphenidate, MDPV, etc.

So (excluding limitations of research) are MDAI + DRAs (excluding [meth]amphetamine) and MDAI + DRIs both non-neurotoxic? Or just one of them? Thanks.

^ I think the point ebola was rightfully trying to make is that we simply don't know for sure at the moment. The evidence suggests MDAI + DRIs should be non-neurotoxic, but this is only based on the limit knowledge we have right now, and we may discover this to be untrue in the future.


As with any case of there being limited knowledge on the subject I'd advise caution as always. Treat it like it is neurotoxic even if the science points to that not being true imo - avoid taking it too often, repeated redoses, etc, and you should be fine ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Thanks. I'm thinking of just trying MDAI on its own now, like I used to. Would adding a dopamine agonist just increase alertness etc.? Because I'd happily rather avoid the increased heart rate and urge to redose related to dopamine agonists.


Just realised I've gone off topic, sorry. How does IAP compare to MDAI? I find MDAI urges me to talk to people, and enhances music pretty well. At high doses ~250mg I'd get eye wobbles, slight jaw trembling and teeth grinding, and a decent amount of euphoria, but of course, I couldn't recommend someone to try this.


I'm also having difficulty finding this substance from any of my trusted sources, and after having a terrible experience from some bunk 6-APB from one of the most well known vendors, I'm unwilling to put my trust elsewhere.

Adding a dopamine releaser increases the euphoria to MDMA levels as well as increasing confidence, sociability, energy and physical side effects (nystagmus, jew tension etc.). 


I too am interested in comparison between IAP and MDAI.

I guess I'll just have to try for myself to see what dopamine adds to MDAI.

5'11 145 lbs male. on no medication.

used a scale for dosage. labelled "IAP" clumpy, white appearance. 

lots of experience with previous psychotropics

~60 mg oral mixed with water empty stomach (last meal 4 hours ago) - doesn't mix well with water - small clumps stick to side of wine-glass - swirl it down with more water. taste isn't too bad. more sour than bitter (!?)

.45mins - 2nd dose of ~40mg

1hr in "come up" feeling. eyes dilated. go outside - slight social anxiety despite in sunglasses.

1.15hrs - colours more vibrant, energy/ flush feeling in face & genitals (keep gum handy - a little jaw tension)

1.30+hrs - increased vibrancy, quite lovely. lines very clear. would be a good enhancer to go to the gallery or see a good film. - nice visual, but no strong mental change (only a sense of pleasure at such an easy, gentle trip) -  doesn't get any more intense than this, but lasts. genitals hot. no erectile dysfunction. energy. slight "floaty" feeling to moving around

4 hrs - decided it would be fun to drink & smoke cigarettes. Drank half a bottle of sherry. Did not drink any water! MISTAKE. IAP by itself is probably quite dehydrating. By midnight I had a headache. Headache throughout the night with slightly raised temperature and diarrhea. Headache persists until 2pm the following afternoon. I recommend no alcohol - or if you do include it - drink lots of water.


duration: about 8 hrs - colours stayed vibrant until the last hour, energy up but also with a slightly wobbly feeling in the limbs, genitals flushed until the last hour. Note - half of this trip was mixed with alcohol.


conclusion: would be a good sex/art-gallery chem - not as strong as a good E (no euphoric, "loved-up" feeling nor rushes of energy), but still nice for a mild psychotropic break or a little enhancement to a good, long fuck. No changed introspection - not a thinking, but a doing chem.


enjoy while it lasts! ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Interesting report. 


Has anyone else here tried snorting IAP? I found when snorted, just 5-10mg produced a rush like snorted MDMA, albeit milder, and more on the warm relaxed side than the amphetamine rush side. I think it seemed a lot more effective than oral though, since my first experience with 60mg oral mostly just showed antidepressant qualities until I added stimulants to the mix. Snorted IAP on its own however performed a lot better.


That said, I'd be careful about snorting it. It doesn't hurt bad or anything but it left my nose blocked for a good 24 hours in a way that no other drug has, so I'm a little wary.

5'11 145 lbs male. on no medication.

used a scale for dosage. labelled "IAP" clumpy, white appearance.

lots of experience with previous psychotropics (especially MDMA)

100 mg orally administered, mixed with water on an empty stomach (last meal 3 hours ago) - doesn't mix well with water - small clumps stick to side of wine-glass - swirl it down with more water. Taste isn't too bad. More sour than bitter (!?)


1 hour in, eyes massively dilated. No real energy, more a shakiness in the limbs. Some empathy - talked with a friend who was depressed & made me feel low. Unpleasant introspection. Wanted to lay down. Instead we went out to cheer ourselves up. Fun to be around people for a while, but no urge or real ability to dance. Increased vibrancy of lights in the club.


8 hour trip. Felt social, but only in a sober way. Didn't stay out for long. Went home & had slow, sensual sex - orgasm was drawn out & powerful. Eyes massively dilated to the very end of the 8 hours. Strong jaw clench last few hours that made sleep impossible without taking 2 zopiclone.


Headache next morning. Had lots of water last night, so pain probably not due to dehydration but to jaw clenching in the last few hours and probably through some of my 8 hours of sleep. Sleep must have been bad, because I slept for another 3 or 4 hours in the afternoon.


Compared to other substances, IAP isn't that interesting. It is possible I need a higher dose & should take magnesium with it. So far, though, not very impressed at the effects.

I wouldn't go pushing the dose much higher. Although at higher doses people have reported they seem to finally get enough of the dopaminergic effects to give it a rush, they also seem to report serotonin-syndrome like effects e.g. hot flashes, nausea, etc.


Personally I think snorting this seems to be the ROA to go for as I've had a very pleasant rush from snorting it while orally the effects are on the milder side until other substances are thrown into the mix. That said though, snorting this stuff really blocked up my nose so be careful.

Thanks. I've decided against pushing the oral dose. So now I'm left with some fairly boring stuff, unless I'm willing to try different ROA.


Not keen to insufflate or plug.


From reviewing this thread, I see that there's some info on smoking in terms of amounts (5 - 10 mgs) & effects & duration (4 hours). Someone mentioned it must be freebased.


Is this true? If so, what is the best method?

This is wrong, first of all there's no reason to beleive that serotonin release causes more paranoia because of 5HT2A potentiating D2, 5HT2A antagonism wont help stim paranoia and D2 atagonism doesnt in my experience either (with selective antagonists).

Releasers also release glutamate trough A7, this caused increased nmda activation wich increases gaba while amphetamines themself release gaba too. Reuptake inhibitors dont.


5HT2A (togheterwith a1b) entirely mediates amp induced da release, 5HT2A antagonism lowers dopamine and def doesnt raise it, altough this was assumed at first as new ap's increased pfc da, but its not because of that. 5HT2A, 5HT3, 5HT4 all increase dopamine, not that it matters as dopamine is not what causes euphoria.

I am interested in trying 5-methoxy-IAP.  Anybody tried that one yet?  f&b expressed interest in it as well.

Might be worthy of its own thread since it's a different drug entirely, I'm be curious about this one too. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Feel free to start a thread if you like, and with any info you know so far about the drug, maybe links to any reports you've read if anyone has tried it. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I haven't mixed IAP & 5-meo-DALT, but I once took 5-meo-DALT at the tail-end of a 6APB trip. Nothing happened for some hours, but after about 3hrs, my heart-rate went up & anxiety and depression kicked in badly for several hours. Very unpleasant indeed. But who knows, maybe that was just me?

I guess you are talking about 5-MeO-DALT instead of DALT? those are two different compounds, so using one as an abbreviation for the other is confusing and therefore must be avoided.

Sounds pretty brutal. With my combination I would be taking IAP/5-MEO-DALT together and I'd just be coming up on the IAP when the 5-MEO-DALT took sharp effect and then fade back into IAP, but this could mean my serotonin levels could go through the roof and get locked that way leading to serotonin syndrome and death, that might well happen with 5-MEO-DALT and 6-APB too so I don't recommend trying it. I think 5-MEO-DALT is a troublesome compound in combination with other drugs and certainly one I won't be experimenting with any time soon. Stay safe

Useful that you should raise this point. I have lots of 5-MEO-DALT which I really enjoy (but only doing one thing - sex). I also have some IAP which I've found very boring in comparison to other stuff. I'm sometimes tempted to mix things, but am always cautious because of my virtual ignorance of chemistry. I suppose my IAP will just continue to sit in it's bag.

I addressed this where you posted it in another thread, but I will post it here too: SSRIs and serotonin releasers *do* mix, and are safe to do so (as long as the drugs in question are not MAOIs or potent CYP2D6 inhibitors).

SSRIs tend to block the effects of SRAs so while it is not generally dangerous to mix the two I don't think it's entriely correct to say that they *do* mix.

2C-I acts as a stimulant at sub-hallucinogenic doses. 2C-I is far safer than amphetamine. 5-APDI + 2C-I(low dose) would be fun to try. Maybe MDAI + 2C-I(low dose) as well.

I wonder what 4-MA would be like? It supposedly releases plenty of serotonin. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Methylamphetamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4-Methylamphetamine)

4-MA is apparently neurotoxic, or at least: there are symptoms observed that point to serotonin depletion that is much more serious than from something like MDMA. So unless you want to become depressed overnight I wouldn't try it. Actually I have some that I probably got when I was collecting stuff like mad, but you couldn't pay me to take it. I also have 2-MA but that sounds like an appetite suppressant mostly. Either way I believe they have their own threads in other forums if you are interested... use the search engine. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Still curious about this one. As far as I can understand, the IAP doing the rounds round vendors might not have been legit? It doesn't seem to crop up that often, which is too bad - I had placed an order with "the dane" (before a number of drugs like 4-mmc, etc. became illegal in .dk - foresight, they have, those danes) but it was never honoured because if problems relating to things previously mentioned. 


Is it just that it seems so promising and people have gotten duds? Or is it just plain non-interesting, even with DRI support?

Crap like MDAI crap (useful in conjunction with other tings) or crap like in buphedrone (sucky alternative to coffee) crap? Or is it the cost/efffect ratio that comes into play here?

Yes, crap like I've heard buphedrone is (not had it myself). If you desperately need a stim. & have nothing laying around but this, you might not do it. (But you probably will, then wish you hadn't). Expect jaw-cletching, jitters and head-ache after your 8hrs of edging stim.

This is at odds with the reports from the early to mid 2000s, where IAP was found not to be very stimulating at all, but not really sedating either.

Yes, perhaps I have something mislabeled or a mix. But the effects on me are like other stimulants: pupils dilate, very slight jaw tension... but I don't sweat hard and it isn't energising in a way that'll make me want to dance all night. And there is a slight hallucinogenic quality that makes this - especially white things & lights - shine just a touch more than usual. But it will keep me awake and allow me to drink about 3 times as much as usual. However, the next day comes with a dehydrated hangover & the shits, no matter what I do to try to mitigate it. I tend to find it most enjoyable in doses of 20-30mgs, perhaps topping up with the same amount4 hours in.

It seems that IAP(IndanylAminoPropane) would be like a weaker form of MDA with longer duration. Maybe DMAA(DiMethylAmylAmine) would make it more stimulating and stronger. IAP seems like a novel entactogen-empathogen that would make a very effective antidepressant and antianxiety type nootropic. I would love to try it and make everything peaceful and warm and happy. People with depression or social anxiety or who gets angry from the crap of life often may finally experience a normal life. If everyone was on IAP, people would probably care for and respect each other more.

What if IAP is one of the first limbic brain enhancers. There are so many intellectual brain enhancers, but so few limbic brain enhancers. I have a high intellectual brain, but I have a poor limbic brain. Plus bad school experiences makes me anxious and depressed and it's like a getting better-got worse-getting better-got worse trend. Bad school feelings have a continual rebound effect. ![:(](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f641.png)

The limbic system an ass that reacts in mysterious ways because we all had problems in school where people pick on us and others fo no reason. The subconscious brain stores it and works against us. A weaker limbic system would then work against us as well. Psychedelics have mysterious actions that have been shown to improve cognition and/or mood at sub-psychedelic doses to psychedelic doses. The MDA type compounds mainly have effects on the limbic system via release of feel good chemicals and health boosting chemicals combined with releasing equal amounts of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. IAP seems to have more therapeutic potential and may even effectively treat emotional anxiety and sadness of autism spectrum. Since autistics have a weakened limbic brain(though sometimes a strengthened intellectual brain), they may benefit the most from a mood lift focusing on the limbic brain.

Thanks a lot! I actually have autism so probably a weakened limbic system which is why I despise it, and a brain that has been proven to be plenty intellectual indeed, actually enough to mask most of the affliction most of the time although at a cost.


My interest in IAP has just ramped up again!!!


Then again, how would someone like me benefit aside from having my mood lifted for half a day - that wouldn't mean very much to me and I certainly am not going to use IAP on a frequent basis.

I'm interested in indanylaminopropane too. The positive effects of indanylaminopropane on the limbic brain might be temporary or permanent. If it's permanent, then the limbic brain could be strengthened even after IAP wears off. The limbic brain might grow stronger neurons and heal. Similar to how a nootropic like phenylpiracetam or sunifiram would permanently grow more intelligence neurons even after it leaves the system. I feel like I'm very smart already though. I just need a better limbic brain.

bump


just found out about this chemical in that old paper from Nichols about the furans, and pharmacologically (monoamine uptake inhibition values) this had the closest profile to MDMA, looked very promising. 6-APDB was another one which was pretty similar.


i wonder why this didn't take off? shitty batches from the RC vendors perhaps? in theory this compound wouldn't need a stimulant combined like MDAI or 5-MAPB usually do.


i noticed there are mixed reports, some people finding it stimulating and some not, but well, there has been reports with tested and pure MDMA also not being stimulating at all, too.


too bad it doesn't seem to be around anymore
