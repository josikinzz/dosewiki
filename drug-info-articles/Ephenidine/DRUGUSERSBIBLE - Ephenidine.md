## Subjective Experience

Ephenidine appeared on the markets at the start of 2015, and was purported to
produce a state of dissociative anaesthesia. It was widely reported to be a smoother
dissociative alternative to the other compounds legally available at the time,
specifically MXP and Diphenidine.

My own experiences have aligned with this suggestion. I have invariably found that it
produces a very pleasant and interesting few hours.

The onset is slow. I find that it doesn't kick in for about 2 hours, contrary to
suggestions published in a number of contemporary reports. Its peak lasts perhaps 2-
4 hours, and the come-down is slow and soft.

Consuming (orally) at about 4pm, I can find it difficult to sleep at midnight without
an aid. I also tend to find the following night to be slightly disturbed, inclusive of
vivid dreams. However, the afterglow, which is positive, lasts for several days.

The experience itself, at the level I dose (typically 80mg), is of a slightly euphoric
dissociation, at which I am just about able to hold myself together (in a functional
sense). A factor here is numbness and a slight impairment of motor functions.

At these doses I feel somewhat misaligned with the real world, but I am able to enter
various states of focus, introspection and concentration. The accompanying analgesia
and mood-lift makes this a very nice ride.

Visually, reality has an edge of distortion, but not in terms of any deterioration or
loss of clarity. The world appears to be rather alien and off-key, which, due to the
anxiolytic properties of the chemical, is not threatening. The bodily insentience adds
to this impression, as normal walking, for example, becomes a smooth, floating and
comfortable exercise.

I sense that higher doses would significantly increase the weirdness of the
dissociation, and obviously its intensity too, but the ataraxic comfort and curious
edges at this level have been sufficient for me not to go deeper, so far.

Finally, whilst this is probably my favourite member of this class, its status as a
relatively unknown research chemical, rather than a tried and tested recreational
drug, has deterred anything other than (very) occasional use.

Note that at high doses this drug is capable of producing internal hallucinations, so
due care and attention is warranted with respect to this. In common with other
dissociatives, certain combinations can also be problematic, hence the need for
appropriate research and caution.
