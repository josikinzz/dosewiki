## Overview

### Description

This compound belongs to the class of organic compounds known as naphthalenes. These are compounds containing a naphthalene moiety, which consists of two fused benzene rings.

### Background

Naproxen is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory dug (NSAID) and was initially approved for prescription use in 1976 and then for over-the-counter (OTC) use in 1994.
3
It can effectively manage acute pain as well as pain related to rheumatic diseases, and has a well studied adverse effect profile.
5
Given its overall tolerability and effectiveness, naproxen can be considered a first line treatment for a variety of clinical situations requiring analgesia.
5
Naproxen is available in both immediate and delayed release formulations, in combination with sumatriptan to treat migraines, and in combination with esomeprazole to lower the risk of developing gastric ulcers.
12
13
15
16

### Indication

Naproxen is indicated for the management of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, tendinitis, bursitis, acute gout, primary dysmenorrhea, and for the relief of mild to moderate pain.
12
13
3
Further, it is first-line therapy for osteoarthritis, acute gouty arthritis, dysmenorrhea, and musculoskeletal inflammation and pain.
3

### Pharmacodynamics

Naproxen is an established non-selective NSAID and is useful as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and antipyretic.
5
Similar to other NSAIDs, the pharmacological activity of naproxen can be attributed to the inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase, which in turn reduces prostaglandin synthesis in various tissues and fluids including the synovial fluid, gastric mucosa, and the blood.
5
Although naproxen is an effective analgesic, it can have unintended deleterious effects in the patient. For instance, naproxen can adversely affect blood pressure control.
10
A study found that use of naproxen induced an increase in blood pressure, although the increase was not as significant as that found with ibuprofen use.
10
Further, studies have found that the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding is on average four-fold higher for individuals taking NSAIDs.
11
Other factors that increase the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding include concurrent use of corticosteroids or anticoagulants, and a history of gastrointestinal ulcers.
11

### Mechanism of Action

Prostaglandin G/H synthase 1
Inhibitor
Prostaglandin G/H synthase 2
Inhibitor

### Absorption

Naproxen is available as a free acid and sodium salt.
5
At comparable doses, (naproxen 500 mg = naproxen sodium 550 mg) they differ slightly in their rates of absorption, but otherwise they are therapeutically and pharmacologically equivalent.
5
Naproxen sodium achieves a peak plasma concentration after 1 hour, while peak plasma concentration is observed after 2 hours with naproxen (free acid).
5
There are no differences between the 2 forms in the post-absorption phase pharmacokinetics.
5
The difference in initial absorption should be considered when treating acute pain, since naproxen sodium may offer a quicker onset of action.
5
The mean Cmax for the various formulations (immediate release, enteric coated, controlled release etc.) of naproxen are comparable and range from 94 mcg/mL to 97.4 mcg/mL.
12
13
In one pharmacokinetic study, the mean Tmax of naproxen 500 mg (immediate release) given every 12 hours over 5 days was 3 hours,  compared to a mean Tmax of 5 hours for Naprelan 1000 mg (controlled release) given every 24 hours over 5 days.
12
In this same study, the AUC
0-24hr
was 1446mcgxhr/mL for naproxen immediate release and 1448 mcgxhr/mL for the controlled release formulation.
12
A separate study comparing the pharmacokinetics of Naprosyn tablets and EC-Naprosyn observed the following values: Tmax and AUC
0-12hrs
of EC-Naprosyn were 4 hours and 845 mcgxhr/mL respectively, and Tmax and AUC
0-12hrs
values of Naprosyn were 1.9 hours and 767 mcgxhr/mL respectively.
13
When given in combination with sumatriptan the Cmax of naproxen is roughly 36% lower compared to naproxen sodium 550 mg tablets, and the median Tmax is 5 hours.
15
Based on the AUC and Cmax of naproxen, Vimovo (naproxen/esomeprazole combination product) and enteric-coated naproxen may be considered bioequivalent.
16
Overall, naproxen is rapidly and completely absorbed when administered orally and rectally.
6
5
Food may contribute to a delay in the absorption of orally administered naproxen, but will not affect the extent of absorption.
5

### Metabolism

Naproxen is heavily metabolized in the liver and undergoes both Phase I and Phase II metabolism.
12
13
7
The first step involves demethylation of naproxen via CYP 1A2, 2C8, and 2C9
8
9
. Both naproxen and desmethylnaproxen proceed to Phase II metabolism; however, desmethylnaproxen can form both acyl and phenolic glucoronide products, while naproxen only produces the acyl glucuronide.
8
7
The acyl glucuronidation process involves UGT 1A1, 1A3, 1A6, 1A7, 1A9, 1A10 and 2B7, while phenolic glucuronidation is catalyzed by UGT 1A1, 1A7,1A9, and 1A10.
8
Desmethylnaproxen also undergoes sulphation which is mediated by SULT 1A1, 1B1 and 1E1.

### Half-life

The elimination half-life of naproxen is reported to be 12-17 hours.

13

### Toxicity

Although the over-the-counter (OTC) availability of naproxen provides convenience to patients, it also increases the likelihood of overdose.
3
Thankfully, the extent of overdose is typically mild with adverse effects normally limited to drowsiness, lethargy, epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting.
3
12
13
Although there is no antidote for naproxen overdose, symptoms will typically subside with appropriate supportive care.
12
13
3
Naproxen is classified as Category B during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy, and as Category D during the third trimester.
14
Naproxen is contraindicated in the 3rd trimester since it increases the risk of premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus and should be avoided in pregnant women starting at 30 weeks gestation.

### Mechanism of action

As with other non-selective NSAIDs, naproxen exerts it's clinical effects by blocking COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes leading to decreased prostaglandin synthesis.
3
Although both enzymes contribute to prostaglandin production, they have unique functional differences.
3
The COX-1 enzymes is constitutively active and can be found in normal tissues such as the stomach lining, while the COX-2 enzyme is inducible and produces prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation.
4
The COX-2 enzyme mediates the desired antipyretic, analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties offered by Naproxen, while undesired adverse effects such as gastrointestinal upset and renal toxicities are linked to the COX-1 enzyme.

### General Function

Functions as an organic anion/dicarboxylate exchanger that couples organic anion uptake indirectly to the sodium gradient (PubMed:14586168, PubMed:15644426, PubMed:15846473, PubMed:16455804, PubMed:31553721). Transports organic anions such as estrone 3-sulfate (E1S) and urate in exchange for dicarboxylates such as glutarate or ketoglutarate (2-oxoglutarate) (PubMed:14586168, PubMed:15846473, PubMed:15864504, PubMed:22108572, PubMed:23832370). Plays an important role in the excretion of endogenous and exogenous organic anions, especially from the kidney and the brain (PubMed:11306713, PubMed:14586168, PubMed:15846473). E1S transport is pH- and chloride-dependent and may also involve E1S/cGMP exchange (PubMed:26377792). Responsible for the transport of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2(alpha) (PGF2(alpha)) in the basolateral side of the renal tubule (PubMed:11907186). Involved in the transport of neuroactive tryptophan metabolites kynurenate and xanthurenate (PubMed:22108572, PubMed:23832370). Functions as a biopterin transporters involved in the uptake and the secretion of coenzymes tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), dihydrobiopterin (BH2) and sepiapterin to urine, thereby determining baseline levels of blood biopterins (PubMed:28534121). May be involved in the basolateral transport of steviol, a metabolite of the popular sugar substitute stevioside (PubMed:15644426). May participate in the detoxification/ renal excretion of drugs and xenobiotics, such as the histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists fexofenadine and cimetidine, the antibiotic benzylpenicillin (PCG), the anionic herbicide 2,4-dichloro-phenoxyacetate (2,4-D), the diagnostic agent p-aminohippurate (PAH), the antiviral acyclovir (ACV), and the mycotoxin ochratoxin (OTA), by transporting these exogenous organic anions across the cell membrane in exchange for dicarboxylates such as 2-oxoglutarate (PubMed:11669456, PubMed:15846473, PubMed:16455804). Contributes to the renal uptake of potent uremic toxins (indoxyl sulfate (IS), indole acetate (IA), hippurate/N-benzoylglycine (HA) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF)), pravastatin, PCG, E1S and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and is partly involved in the renal uptake of temocaprilat (an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) (PubMed:14675047). May contribute to the release of cortisol in the adrenals (PubMed:15864504). Involved in one of the detoxification systems on the choroid plexus (CP), removes substrates such as E1S or taurocholate (TC), PCG, 2,4-D and PAH, from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the blood for eventual excretion in urine and bile (By similarity). Also contributes to the uptake of several other organic compounds such as the prostanoids prostaglandin E(2) and prostaglandin F(2-alpha), L-carnitine, and the therapeutic drugs allopurinol, 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (By similarity). Mediates the transport of PAH, PCG, and the statins pravastatin and pitavastatin, from the cerebrum into the blood circulation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In summary, plays a role in the efflux of drugs and xenobiotics, helping reduce their undesired toxicological effects on the body (By similarity)

  "wikipedia": `# Naproxen
*Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naproxen*

Naproxen, sold under the brand name Aleve among others, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat pain, menstrual cramps, and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and fever. It is taken orally. It is available in immediate and delayed release formulations. Onset of effects is within an hour and lasts for up to twelve hours. Naproxen is also available in salt form, naproxen sodium, which has better solubility when taken orally.
Common side effects include dizziness, headache, bruising, allergic reactions, heartburn, and stomach pain. Severe side effects include an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, and stomach ulcers. The heart disease risk may be lower than with other NSAIDs. It is not recommended in people with kidney problems. Use is not recommended in the third trimester of pregnancy.
Naproxen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. As an NSAID, naproxen appears to exert its anti-inflammatory action by reducing the production of inflammatory mediators called prostaglandins. It is metabolized by the liver to inactive metabolites.
Naproxen was patented in 1967 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1976. In the United States it is available over-the-counter and as a generic medication. In 2023, it was the 103rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 6 million prescriptions. Naproxen is a therapeutic alternative on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.

## Medical uses

Naproxen's medical uses are related to its mechanism of action as an anti-inflammatory compound. Naproxen is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions and symptoms that are due to excessive inflammation, such as pain and fever (naproxen has fever-reducing, or antipyretic, properties in addition to its anti-inflammatory activity). Naproxen's anti-inflammatory properties relieve pain caused by inflammatory conditions such as migraine, osteoarthritis, kidney stones, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, gout, ankylosing spondylitis, menstrual cramps, tendinitis, and bursitis.  Naproxen has also proven effective for acute post-operative pain.
Naproxen sodium is used as a "bridge therapy" in medication-overuse headache to slowly take patients off other medications.

### Available formulations

Naproxen sodium is available as both an immediate-release and an extended-release tablet. The extended-release formulations (sometimes called "sustained release", or "enteric coated") take longer to take effect than the immediate-release formulations and therefore are less useful when immediate pain relief is desired. Extended-release formulations are more useful for the treatment of chronic, or long-lasting, conditions, in which long-term pain relief is desirable.

### Pregnancy and lactation

As with all non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), naproxen use should be avoided in pregnancy due to the importance of prostaglandins in vascular and renal function in the fetus. NSAIDs should especially be avoided in the third trimester. Small amounts of naproxen are excreted in breast milk. However, adverse effects are uncommon in infants breastfed from a mother taking naproxen.

## Adverse effects

Common adverse effects include dizziness, drowsiness, headache, rash, bruising, and gastrointestinal upset. Heavy use is associated with an increased risk of end-stage renal disease and kidney failure. Naproxen may cause muscle cramps in the legs in 3% of people.
In October 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the prescribing information to be updated for all nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications to describe the risk of kidney problems in unborn babies that result in low amniotic fluid. They recommend avoiding NSAIDs in pregnant women at 20 weeks or later in pregnancy.

### Gastrointestinal

As with other non-COX-2 selective NSAIDs, naproxen can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as heartburn, constipation, diarrhea, ulcers and stomach bleeding. Naproxen should be taken orally with, or just after food, to decrease the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Persons with a history of ulcers or inflammatory bowel disease should consult a doctor before taking naproxen. In U.S. markets, naproxen is sold with boxed warnings about the risk of gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding. Naproxen poses an intermediate risk of stomach ulcers compared with ibuprofen, which is low-risk, and indometacin, which is high-risk. To reduce stomach ulceration risk, it is often combined with a proton-pump inhibitor (a medication that reduces stomach acid production) during long-term treatment of those with pre-existing stomach ulcers or a history of developing stomach ulcers while on NSAIDs.

### Cardiovascular

COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs have been linked to increases in the number of serious and potentially fatal cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions and strokes. Naproxen is, however, associated with the smallest overall cardiovascular risks. Cardiovascular risk must be considered when prescribing any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. The drug had roughly 50% of the associated risk of stroke compared with ibuprofen and was also associated with a reduced number of myocardial infarctions compared with control groups.
A study found that high-dose naproxen induced near-complete suppression of platelet thromboxane throughout the dosing interval and appeared not to increase cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, whereas other non-aspirin high-dose NSAID regimens had only transient effects on platelet COX-1 and were associated with a small but definite vascular hazard. Conversely, naproxen was associated with higher rates of upper gastrointestinal bleeding complications compared with other NSAIDs.

## Drug-drug interactions

Naproxen may interact with antidepressants, lithium, methotrexate, probenecid, warfarin and other blood thinners, heart or blood pressure medications, including diuretics, or steroid medicines such as prednisone.
NSAIDs such as naproxen may interfere with and reduce the efficacy of SSRI antidepressants, as well as increase the risk of bleeding greater than the individual bleeding risk of either class of agent, when taken together. Naproxen is not contraindicated in the presence of SSRIs, though concomitant use of the medications should be done with caution. Alcohol consumption increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when combined with NSAIDs like naproxen in a dose-dependent manner (that is, the higher the dose of naproxen, the higher the risk of bleeding). The risk is highest for people who are heavy drinkers.

## Pharmacology

### Mechanism of action

Naproxen works by reversibly inhibiting both the COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes as a non-selective coxib.

### Pharmacokinetics

Naproxen is a minor substrate of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9. It is extensively metabolized in the liver to 6-O-desmethylnaproxen, and both the parent drug and the desmethyl metabolite undergo further metabolism to their respective acylglucuronide conjugated metabolites. An analysis of two clinical trials shows that naproxen's time to peak plasma concentration occurs between 2 and 4 hours after oral administration (the naproxen sodium formulation of the medication reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1–2 hours).

### Pharmacogenetics

The pharmacogenetics of naproxen has been studied to better understand its adverse effects. In 1998, a small pharmacokinetic (PK) study failed to show that differences in a patient's ability to clear naproxen from the body could account for differences in a patient's risk of experiencing the adverse effect of a serious gastrointestinal bleed while taking naproxen. However, the study failed to account for differences in the activity of CYP2C9, a drug-metabolizing enzyme that is necessary for clearing naproxen. Studies on the relationship between CYP2C9 genotype and NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds have shown that genetic variants in CYP2C9 that reduce the clearance of major CYP2C9 substrates (like naproxen) increase the risk of NSAID-induced gastrointestinal bleeds, especially for homozygous defective variants.

## Chemistry

Naproxen is a member of the 2-arylpropionic acid (profen) family of NSAIDs. The free acid is an odorless, white to off-white crystalline substance. Naproxen free base is lipid-soluble and practically insoluble in water, while naproxen sodium and many other salts are freely soluble in water, often soluble in methanol, and sparingly soluble in alcohol; check the specific solubility of each salt before use. Naproxen has a melting point of 152–155 °C, while naproxen salts tend to have higher melting points.

### Synthesis

Naproxen has been industrially produced by Syntex starting from 2-naphthol as follows:

## Society and culture

### Brand names

Naproxen and naproxen sodium are marketed under various brand names, including Accord, Aleve, Anaprox, Antalgin, Apranax, Feminax Ultra, Flanax, Inza, Maxidol, Nalgesin, Naposin, Naprelan, Naprogesic, Naprosyn, Narocin, Pronaxen, Proxen, Soproxen, and Xenifar. It is also available as the combination naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium in delayed-release tablets under the brand name Vimovo.

### Access restrictions

Syntex first marketed naproxen in 1976, as the prescription drug Naprosyn. They first marketed naproxen sodium under the brand name Anaprox in 1980. It remains a prescription-only drug in much of the world. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug in 1994. OTC preparations of naproxen in the U.S. are mainly marketed by Bayer HealthCare under the brand name Aleve and generic store brand formulations in 220 mg tablets. In Australia, packets of 275 mg tablets of naproxen sodium are Schedule 2 pharmacy medicines, with a maximum daily dose of five tablets or 1375 mg. In the United Kingdom, 250 mg tablets of naproxen were approved for OTC sale under the brand name Feminax Ultra in 2008, for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhoea in women aged 15 to 50. In the Netherlands, 220 mg and 275 mg tablets are available OTC in drugstores, 550 mg is OTC only at pharmacies. Aleve became available over the counter in some provinces in Canada on 14 July 2009, but not British Columbia, Quebec or Newfoundland and Labrador; it subsequently became available OTC in British Columbia in January 2010 and Quebec in 2023.

## Ecological effects

Naproxen has been found in groundwater and drinking water in concentrations high enough to have adverse effects on invertebrates including fungi, algae, bacteria and fishes. Naproxen is not thoroughly removed by conventional water treatment methods, and its degradation pathways in the environment are limited. Some methods more successfully remove naproxen from wastewater, including metal-organic complexes and porous carbon. Although the levels are generally low enough to not be acutely toxic, sub-lethal effects may still occur, such as reduced photosynthetic ability.

## Research

Naproxen may have antiviral activity against influenza. In laboratory research, it blocks the RNA-binding groove of the nucleoprotein of the virus, preventing the formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex—thus taking the viral nucleoproteins out of circulation.

## Veterinary use

### Horses

Naproxen is given by mouth to horses at a dose of 10 mg/kg and has shown to have a wide safety margin (no toxicity when given at three times the recommended dose for 42 days). It is more effective for myositis than the commonly used NSAID phenylbutazone, and has shown especially good results for treatment of equine exertional rhabdomyolysis, a disease of muscle breakdown; it is less commonly used for musculoskeletal disease.
