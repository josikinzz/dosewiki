[Deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriants) are highly unpredictable and may result in erratic behaviors, self-injury, hospitalization, or death. It should be noted that most individuals do not choose to repeat the experience due to its unpleasant nature.
 
Please use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_use) if using this substance (e.g. starting with a low dose and always having a [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) ). Refer to [this section](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPH#Toxicity_and_harm_potential) for more details.
**Diphenhydramine** (also known as **DPH** , **Dimedrol, Benadryl** , and many others) is a [deliriant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) substance of the [ethanolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ethanolamine) class. It is a first-generation H 1 [antihistamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antihistamine) that is widely used as a generic, over-the-counter medication to treat allergies. When exceeding approved doses, diphenhydramine produces powerful deliriant effects.

Diphenhydramine was first synthesized in 1943. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It was approved for over-the-counter use in the 1980s. Today, it is typically used to treat allergies, but it may also be used for several conditions, including itchiness, insomnia, motion sickness, nausea, and the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

[Subjective effects](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects) include [sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [tactile hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucinations) , [memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression) , [thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization) , [dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria) , and [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) . Lower doses tend to produce a stoning, body-high effect, while higher doses produce a state of [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) in which the user sees and hears fully-formed, compelling [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) . Doses between these two points are uncomfortable and dysphoric.

Notably, it is frequently reported to produce significant [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and bodily discomfort ("body load"). Most people who try diphenhydramine do not report positive effects and do not wish to repeat the experience.

It is generally considered to have low abuse potential due to its dysphoric effects. The toxicity of recreational use is not well-studied. Anecdotal reports suggest that chronic use (i.e., high dose, repeated administration) may cause persisting hallucinations and impairments in cognition & memory. High doses have also been linked to seizures and cardiotoxicity.

It is highly advised to use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Harm_reduction_practices) if using this substance.

## History and culture

Diphenhydramine was discovered in 1943 by George Rieveschl, a former professor at the University of Cincinnati. In 1946, it became the first prescription antihistamine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In the 1960s, diphenhydramine was found to inhibit reuptake of the [neurotransmitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter) [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . This discovery led to a search for viable [antidepressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antidepressant) with similar structures and fewer side effects, culminating in the invention of fluoxetine (Prozac), a [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_reuptake_inhibitor) (SSRI).

## Chemistry

Diphenhydramine, or 2-(diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethanamine, is an organic compound in the ethanolamine class. The chemical structure of diphenhydramine consists of an ethylamine chain with two methyl groups bonded to the terminal nitrogen group R N . This ethylamine chain is also substituted at R 2 with a diphenylmethoxy group, forming an ether. The diphenylmethoxy group consists of two aromatic phenyl rings bonded to the carbon member of a methoxy group CH 3 O-.

DPH is produced as a hydrochloride salt.

## Pharmacology

Diphenhydramine is an [inverse agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#agonists) of the peripheral histamine H 1 receptor and a central histamine H 1 receptor. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] The peripheral inverse agonism induces the allergy reducing effects. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] Like many first-generation antihistamines, it is also a competitive antagonist at [mACH receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) . [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

Diphenhydramine is an [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) [receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptor) [antagonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Antagonist) . Although the precise mechanism is not understood, the inhibition of the action of [acetylcholine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Acetylcholine) is thought to be primarily responsible for the delirium, sedation, and intensely realistic hallucinations alongside the extremely uncomfortable and dysphoric physical side effects.

Diphenhydramine has been shown to block sodium channels and inhibit the reuptake of [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) . It also blocks voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs), meaning it has the potential to cause or lead to *torsades de points* , a potentially dangerous cardiac condition that can lead to sudden cardiac death.

The receptor binding affinities are listed as follows:

## Subjective effects

According to user reports, diphenhydramine displays a non-linear dose response, meaning the effects don't correspond directly with the dose. Doses under 300 mg are reported to produce restlessness, [muscle relaxation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_relaxation) , and a [body high](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations) . In comparison, doses above 500 mg begin to produce a state of [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) in which the user sees and hears fully-formed, compelling [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinations) . Doses in between these two extremes are said to be uncomfortable and dysphoric. [Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) and bodily discomfort ("body load") are reported almost universally.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Sedation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sedation)** - Diphenhydramine produces considerable sedation, and low doses are commonly used as a sleep aid. This sense of sedation is accompanied by a heavy body load, which can become overwhelmingly uncomfortable. However, higher doses of diphenhydramine also have a stimulating quality that can make actual rest difficult.
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - Users commonly report all-encompassing, sharp, and painful jolts of electricity that spontaneously manifest themselves uncontrollably in a similar rhythm to hiccups.
- **[Perception of bodily heaviness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perception_of_bodily_heaviness)** - One of the most apparent effects is having a massive body as if gravity multiplied tenfold. This makes it extremely tough and uncomfortable to move.
- **[Restless leg syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Restless_leg_syndrome)** - Restless legs are very prominent and arguably one of the most uncomfortable side effects of diphenhydramine. It can also last for days after the experience and can even be chronic when it is abused repeatedly.
- **[Tactile enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_enhancement)** - This results in increased feelings of touch, pain, warmth, and orgasms. It is usually only present at the peak, not during the come-up or down.
- **[Tactile suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_suppression)** - Diphenhydramine produces feelings of numbness throughout the body. This is attributed to its ability to block sodium channels within the nerves.
- **[Tactile hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tactile_hallucination)** - This is often a direct result of visual [hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) , and they commonly feel and look as if insects are crawling on one's skin.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** or **[Nausea suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea_suppression)** - Depending on the dose, diphenhydramine can both suppress and cause nausea. Low doses effectively suppress nausea, which is why it is marketed and sold as a motion sickness suppressant, while high doses cause it in significant amounts.
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** - Diphenhydramine can prolong the QT interval, potentially leading to torsades de pointes, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause sudden cardiac death.
- **[Cough suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cough_suppression)**
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Diphenhydramine can be extremely dehydrating, which often leads to dry mouth and skin, chapped lips, and nose bleeds. Users should drink plenty of water before and after an experience.
- **[Dry mouth](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dry_mouth)** - Along with dehydration, diphenhydramine makes your mouth very dry. Water can temporarily remedy this, although it usually persists for the entirety of the trip.
- **[Dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness)**
- **[Frequent urination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Frequent_urination)** & **[Difficulty urinating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating)** - Diphenhydramine has the strange effect of making the user want to urinate while making actual urination extremely difficult frequently. This sensation is described as very uncomfortable.
- **[Gustatory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Gustatory_hallucination)** - A foul metallic-like taste is present throughout the entire experience, combined with a dry mouth, which can be a very uncomfortable effect lasting for days after the experience. Eating or drinking flavored drinks will only make the taste go away temporarily. It can also appear as a sign of addiction, where it acts as a trigger for cravings.
- **[Hypotension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypotension)**
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)**
- **[Increased bodily temperature](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_bodily_temperature)**
- **[Temperature regulation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temperature_regulation_suppression)** - This effect can lead the user to experience shivers, especially during the come-up phase.
- **[Increased perspiration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_perspiration)**
- **[Motor control loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motor_control_loss)**
- **[Muscle cramps](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_cramps)** & **[Muscle spasms](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Muscle_spasms)** - Sudden muscle cramps and spasms can form unexpectedly. This is common at the beginning of the trip and usually passes quickly.
- **[Olfactory hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Olfactory_hallucination)** - It is common for users to smell a mild, thick, and dull smell in the air that can easily be ignored most of the time. Some users also notice a smell enhancement [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Physical fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Physical_fatigue)**
- **[Pupil constriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_constriction)** *or* **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)** - While it is known that diphenhydramine constricts pupils minimally , many people also report that their pupils dilate, especially at high dosages when anticholinergic effects take place similar to substances like [atropine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Atropine) or [scopolamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scopolamine) .
- **[Rapid breathing](/w/index.php?title=Rapid_breathing&action=edit&redlink=1)**
- **[Skin flushing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Skin_flushing)** - Flushed skin occurs mostly around the eyes but can also be seen all over the body.
- **[Temporary erectile dysfunction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Temporary_erectile_dysfunction)**
- **[Itchiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Itchiness)** - This effect happens in high doses. However, it reduces itchiness in lower doses due to [histamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Histamine) antagonism.
- **[Teeth grinding](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Teeth_grinding)** - Some users report jaw clenching. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Appetite suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Appetite_suppression)** - Possibly due to the bronchodilation that makes swallowing uncomfortable, [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] DPH is able to make eating uncomfortable as well. This could make a user force themselves to eat, or to stop eating entirely despite hunger before the effects kick in. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] ### Visual effects
 
- While diphenhydramine produces visual hallucinations, it does not enhance visual stimuli in the manner of [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) . Instead, it tends to degrade and decrease visual acuity and processing, which results in increased hallucinations and degraded vision. This becomes more apparent in darker areas than in well-lit ones. 
#### Suppression
 
- **[Double vision](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Double_vision)** - This effect is commonly present at moderate to high doses.
- **[Pattern recognition suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_suppression)**
- **[Visual acuity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_suppression)** - This effect can result in blurry vision to the point of blindness. It sometimes can last for days after the experience itself.
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Drifting)** *( [melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [morphing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Morphing) and [flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - Compared to hallucinogens, this effect can be described as intricate in complexity, jittery and flexible in motion, static in their permanence, realistic in believability, and interactive in plasticity. It is also very faint.
- **[Object alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_alteration)** - The textures seen are described as transparent whirling lines and swirls that move at changing speeds and jitter uncontrollably. They only appear slightly above surfaces, walls, and ceilings and can not be felt.
- **[Brightness alteration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Brightness_alteration)** - Diphenhydramine can cause one's vision to decrease in brightness and become dark and gloomy.
- **[Visual haze](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_haze)**
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
- **[External hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Relative to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , this effect occurs more frequently at moderate to heavy doses and is the defining feature of the experience. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, controllable, or autonomous in controllability and solid in style. The most common themes for these hallucinations include those of everyday occurrences such as smoking phantom cigarettes, talking to people who are not there, seeing and feeling insects, and immersion in sinister or nightmarish experiences.
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - Relative to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , this effect occurs briefly and spontaneously at moderate doses but becomes progressively extended in its occurrence and duration proportional to dosage before eventually becoming all-encompassing. It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as delirious in believability, interactive in style, equal in new experiences and memory replays in content, autonomous in controllability, and solid in style. [Internal hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucinations) may occur at lighter dosages than needed to cause [external hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/External_hallucinations) and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) .
- **[Peripheral information misinterpretation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Peripheral_information_misinterpretation)**

- **[Unspeakable horrors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Unspeakable_horrors)**
- **[Object activation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Object_activation)** ### Cognitive effects
 
- The headspace of diphenhydramine is described by many as generally negative and dysphoric, often consisting of extreme paranoia and feelings of impending doom. It is highly confusing and disorienting and usually results in a complete inability to communicate or understand standard language. 
- **[Analysis suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_suppression)** - At higher dosages, a person could experience a complete halt of external information processing, which can make the user unable to perform simple tasks or make decisions.
- **[Anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety)** & **[Paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia)** - Anxiety and paranoia are more commonly reported on diphenhydramine than almost any other substance. However, there is a threshold dose (around 500mg) where it begins to disappear.
- **[Sleepiness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Sleepiness)** - Diphenhydramine is reported to be extremely tiring. Low doses are often used and sold as a sleep aid.
- **[Wakefulness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Wakefulness)** - Even though diphenhydramine is primarily a [depressant](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) and causes sleepiness, it has stimulant effects on the body, which can also keep the user awake. This effect predominates sleepiness at higher dosages.
- **[Dysphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysphoria)** - The levels of dysphoria experienced, however, vary between people, with a tiny percentage of users reporting that they do not seem to experience them at all.
- **[Euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_euphoria)** - This effect is rare, usually in lower doses. This is likely caused by serotonin inhibition and sedation.
- **[Cognitive fatigue](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cognitive_fatigue)**
- **[Confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion)** - Diphenhydramine causes significant confusion, resulting in a complete inability to understand others' intentions, emotions, humor, and even simple sentences.
- **[Creativity suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Creativity_suppression)**
- **[Decreased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Decreased_libido)** - Interestingly, one's sex drive seems to have diminished, although sex and masturbation are considered more enjoyable in a unique way and often come with powerful orgasms.
- **[Delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium)** - Delirium may be experienced with extremely high doses, which may necessitate hospitalization.
- **[Delusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delusion)**
- **[Depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression)**
- **[Derealization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Derealization)**
- **[Disinhibition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Disinhibition)** - Disinhibition on diphenhydramine is different from substances like [alcohol](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alcohol) , as it may not even be present in certain situations and is heavily influenced by anxiety and paranoia.
- **[Dream potentiation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dream_potentiation)** - Diphenhydramine is extremely effective at potentiating dreams. This can result in not just increased intensity but a change in dream content, leading to dreams that are both vivid and extremely bizarre.
- **[Dysarthria](/w/index.php?title=Dysarthria&action=edit&redlink=1)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] - Slurred speech and speaking with a different voice is common on DPH.

- **[Amnesia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Amnesia)** - At higher dosages, diphenhydramine can cause a complete halt of external information processing, making the user unable to perform simple tasks or make decisions.
- **[Motivation suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Motivation_suppression)** - Diphenhydramine can cause a complete loss of motivation to do almost anything. This is often accompanied by [depression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depression) and can make the user extremely bored and restless.
- **[Psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis)**
- **[Thought deceleration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_deceleration)**
- **[Thought disorganization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Thought_disorganization)**
- **[Time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion)** - Although not extreme, time dilation is felt and can be overwhelming if the user is having a difficult trip. ### Auditory effects
 
- - **[Auditory hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations)** - Auditory hallucinations like voices and screams are commonly reported on diphenhydramine.

## Forms

Diphenhydramine is available in several forms, both over the counter and online.

- **Pills** are available over the counter and online. Well-known brands include Benadryl, Benylin, Dramamine, Nytol, Sominex, Vivinox, and ZzzQuil. Rarely, some of these products may contain other medicines, including [dextromethorphan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) , guaifenesin, and acetaminophen. Care should be taken when using these products to ensure that there is not an overdose of other medicines in these DPH-containing products.
- **Liquid** is available over the counter and online. Diphenhydramine in liquid form can be taken orally or injected. Well-known brands include Benadryl and ZzzQuil. Rarely, some of these products may contain other medicines, including [dextromethorphan](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DXM) , guaifenesin, and acetaminophen. Care should be taken when using these products to ensure no overdose of other medicines in DPH-containing products.
- **Powder** is available online. Diphenhydramine in powdered form can be taken orally or via injection. Any other routes of administration are not recommended because diphenhydramine burns and dehydrates skin tissue, leading to extremely painful burns and bleeding.

### Dimenhydrinate

**Dimenhydrinate** ( **DMH** ) is a combination drug of diphenhydramine and [8-Chlorotheophylline](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8-Chlorotheophylline) , marketed as **Draminate** , **Dramamine** , and **Gravol** among others, it is used to treat [nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea) . It is most commonly available as tablets, although it is also available in liquid form and as a [suppository](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Routes_of_administration#Rectal) . In practice, dimenhydrinate is half as potent as pure diphenhydramine. By weight, dimenhydrinate is between 53% to 55.5% diphenhydramine. The addition of the caffeine-like stimulant 8-Chlorotheophylline is reported to increase the dangerous cardiovascular effects diphenhydramine already has alone. This stimulant effect is also reported to make the trip more restless and dysphoric, with the added negative of being too wakeful to sleep the trip away.

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational diphenhydramine use have not been studied extensively.

Diphenhydramine can be highly unpredictable, and the mechanism by which it produces hallucinations has the potential to result in serious injury, hospitalization, or death. Additionally, diphenhydramine puts users in a state where they have little control over their actions. Diphenhydramine can provoke bizarre and nonsensical behavior, which may put the user at risk.

Anecdotal reports suggest that regular use of diphenhydramine can have profound effects on one's kidney and bladder with the potential to result in issues similar to that of [ketamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ketamine) cystitis.

Cumulative diphenhydramine use has been tentatively linked to an increased risk of developing dementia.

Some chronic users also report the worsening of mental illnesses (e.g. [depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder) , [anxiety disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety_disorder) , [schizophrenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia) ) [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

### Overdose

The overdose threshold for diphenhydramine is commonly held to be around 1000 milligrams; however, sensitive individuals or individuals taking other drugs alongside it can overdose with less. The main effects of an overdose are similar to those of heavy doses. Effects include [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) , [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) , [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [confusion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Confusion) , [hypotension](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hypotension) , dryness, [urinary retention](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Difficulty_urinating) , [dizziness](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dizziness) , [dilated pupils](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation) and [increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate) . Some of the more serious side effects at these doses include an even higher risk of [seizures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Seizures) and dangerous cardiovascular effects such as arrhythmia ( [abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat) ).

The user may be completely unable to distinguish reality from hallucinations. For this reason, there is a significant risk of the user responding to a delusional environment and injuring themselves or others, as well as the possibility of engaging in too much physical activity which can further strain the heart or cause [rhabdomyolysis](/w/index.php?title=Rhabdomyolysis&action=edit&redlink=1) . Individuals experiencing delusions should, if possible, not be agitated. The first line of treatment for overdose should be [benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines) , although medical attention should always be sought.

Diphenhydramine can become fatal at amounts close to or exceeding 2 grams. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] This can result in death, especially when combined with most [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) , [depressants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depressant) and [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) .

### Psychosis

Some anecdotal reports suggest that diphenhydramine causes [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) and [delirium](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Delirium) at a significantly higher rate than other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) (i.e. [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) and [dissociative](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dissociative) ). [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*] There are a large number of experience reports online that describe states of psychotic delirium, amnesia, and other serious consequences after abusing the substance. In many cases, it has resulted in hospitalization and death. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

The recreational use of diphenhydramine is generally not advised. If deciding to use this substance, one should use extreme caution and [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) , such as having a sober [trip sitter](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Trip_sitter) .

### Dependence and abuse potential

Diphenhydramine produces dependence with chronic use. In comparison to other [hallucinogens](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Hallucinogens) , DPH has been reported to have significantly less abuse potential than other hallucinogens. Most people who try it do not wish to repeat the experience.

Tolerance to many of the effects of DPH develops with repeated use. Users have to administer increasingly large doses to achieve the impact. After that, it takes about 1 - 2 weeks for tolerance to return to baseline (in the absence of further consumption). DPH presents cross-tolerance with all [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) , meaning that after the consumption of DPH, all [deliriants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deliriant) will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **[Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Selective_serotonin_re-uptake_inhibitors) (SSRIs)** - SSRIs can suppress the visual effects of diphenhydramine. However, this combination may elevate the risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) due to diphenhydramine's weak serotonergic effects.
- **[Stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulants)** - Due to diphenhydramine's excitatory cardiac effect, combining it with stimulants poses a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, severe tachycardia, or a heart attack as well as other cardiovascular events.
- **[Benzodiazepines](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Benzodiazepines)** - Benzodiazepines can suppress the visual effects of diphenhydramine. However, this combination can produce a dangerous amount of sedation and respiratory depression. [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Anticholinergics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anticholinergics)** - Due to diphenhydramine's excitatory cardiac effect, combining it with other anticholinergics poses a risk of an abnormal heart rhythm, severe tachycardia, or a heart attack as well as other cardiovascular events (inhibition of acetylcholine causes increased heart rate).

## Legal status

Diphenhydramine is available either over the counter or by prescription in most countries. However, some countries require the purchaser to be over 16, 18, or 21.

- **Zambia:** Diphenhydramine is illegal to possess and sell in Zambia; foreigners have been detained for possession.
- **United States:** Diphenhydramine is widely available over-the-counter in the United States. It is an approved drug and is legal to buy, possess, and ingest without a license or prescription.
- **Poland:** Diphenhydramine is not a controlled substance under Polish law, it can only be bought by individuals over the age of 18 and is found only in sleep medication.
