## Effects
The effect is very much dependent on dose, set and setting. As a hallucinogen, LSD intensifies and alienates sensory perceptions and the sense of space-time. Mood and feelings can change abruptly. At higher doses, feelings of detachment from one's own body can occur. Especially in the initial phase of the trip, slight breathing difficulties, palpitations, sweating, altered blood pressure and nausea may occur.

## Risks

### Short-term Risks
The risks of LSD use are psychological and depend on the personality structure of the user. The perceptual changes during a trip can be so intense that inexperienced users in particular feel overwhelmed by the flood of impressions. This can lead to erroneous reactions, loss of orientation, panic, paranoia and badtrips/horror trips.
There is a risk - even with single use - that latent (hidden) mental disorders can be triggered. LSD does not lead to organ damage or genetic mutations and is not physically addictive.

## Safer Use
- Take LSD only if you are well prepared, in an environment where you feel comfortable, and only with experienced friends (favourable setting).
- Only take LSD when you feel good mentally and physically (cheap set).
- You should not be afraid, but have enough respect for the LSD effect.
- Do not consume LSD on a full stomach, but eat something light before or during the high.
- Dose low. Don't throw it if it doesn't work right away!
- Let yourself go during the trip, don't try to fight the LSD effect.
- Dextrose can help against circulatory problems.
- Avoid roads and other "dangerous" places, your orientation may be disturbed.
- At least the day after the trip, allow yourself plenty of rest and recovery to be able to process the experience.
- LSD trips should remain exceptional experiences and should in no case be experienced more than once a month.
- People with mental problems or illnesses, people taking neuroleptics and people with circulatory and heart problems should refrain from consuming LSD.

## Adulterants & Extenders

For the effect of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), apart from the dose, one's own state of mind (set) and the environment (setting) are always very decisive. When consuming LSD felts, there is a risk of ingesting misdeclared substances, pharmacologically active extenders and/or high-dose felts. The highly variable active substance content of LSD felts can lead to the unintentional ingestion of high doses of LSD, which increase the risk of a negative experience (bad trip). High doses increase the risk even for experienced users. Highly intense psychedelic experiences can be induced, which can be disturbing and frightening. In recent years, we have repeatedly analysed misdeclared LSD felts (felts containing another psychoactive substance instead of LSD). Depending on the substance, such misdeclarations pose a high health risk.

### Common Adulterants

**NBOMe connections**
NBOMe compounds belong to the group of phenethylamines. Typical for phenylethylamines is an increased perception of digestion and the intestine (gastrointestinal sensation) as well as a strongly sensitised sense of touch. Visual effects occur, but are less prominent than with LSD. According to user reports, the effects of 25l-NBOMe*HCl, 25B-NBOMe*HCl and 25C-NBOMe*HCl vary from time to time, so the effect cannot be predicted. Unlike LSD, felts with NBOMe have a bitter taste.

**DOC**
Only little information exists on DOC / 2,5-dimethoxy-4-chloroamphetamine. However, DOC can lead to chest pain and vasoconstriction. Due to the late onset of action, there is a risk of overdose. The very long duration of action of approx. 20 h should definitely be taken into account.
