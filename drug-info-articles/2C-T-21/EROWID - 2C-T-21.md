U.S. FEDERAL LAW #
 
Caution : All legal information should be verified through other sources. [ see below ]
 
**U.S. FEDERAL LEGAL SUMMARY**
**2C-T-21**
- REGULATED: No
- STATUS: Not Approved ForHuman Consumption
- SCHEDULE: Possible Analog
 
2C-T-21 is unscheduled in the United States. It is possible that it could be considered an analog (of 2C-T-7), in which case, sales for human consumption or possession with the intent to ingest could be prosecuted under the [Federal Analogue Act](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/law/analog/analog.shtml) . 
 
 
In 2004 [several cases](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_info1.shtml) related to research chemicals were pending in U.S. federal court. A chemical supplier was federally charged in fall of 2004 with intent to distribute "2C-T-2 1 [2,5-Dimethoxy-4- (2-fluoroethylthio)Phenethylamine HCL],...controlled substance analogues as defined by Title 21, United States Code, Section 802(32)(A), knowing that the substances were intended for human consumption." -- [See indictment of American Chemical Supply](https://erowid.org/psychoactives/research_chems/research_chems_law2.shtml) . On March 21, 2005, Burton plead guilty to Count One of the indictment. See [DEA press release about subsequent sentencing](http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/lam/press/press0510.html#burton) . We are unaware of any cases against individuals for possession alone (10/2/2006).
