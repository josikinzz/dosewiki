**N-Methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **MiPT** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. It is structurally related to [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , along with other analogs such as [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) , [MPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MPT) , and [MET](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MET) .

MiPT was first synthesized and investigated by [Alexander Shulgin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Alexander_Shulgin) and described in his book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved"). In the commentary, Shulgin notes that "there is almost a total lack of visual phenomena... no wave-forms, color distortion or object shape changes, and no eyes-closed imagery, unlike most N,N-disubstituted tryptamines."

Subjective effects include hallucinatory states, [time distortion](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Time_distortion) , [conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking) , [euphoria](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Euphoria) , and [ego loss](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ego_loss) . Its effects are generally described as mild, indistinct, and highly variable between users. In contrast to many related tryptamines, it is able to be taken [orally](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Orally) .

Today, MiPT remains relatively uncommon and is either used as a recreational or an [entheogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entheogenic) substance. It has been distributed online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of MiPT in humans, and it has little history of human usage.

## Chemistry

MiPT, or N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure that comprises a bicyclic indole heterocycle attached at R3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. Unlike [DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DMT) , which contains two methyl groups, MiPT contains groups of one methyl and one isopropyl carbon chains bound to the terminal amine RN of its tryptamine backbone. MiPT is the methyl analog of [DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DiPT) .

## Pharmacology

Like with most [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) tryptamines, MiPT is thought to act principally as a [5-HT2A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) . The psychedelic effects are believed to come from MiPT's binding efficacy at the 5-HT 2A receptors.

However, the role of these interactions and how it results in the psychedelic experience continues to remain elusive.

## Subjective effects

The sensory effects of MiPT are said to be similar to those of DiPT but with less intensity at the same dose, and without the same bias towards producing auditory distortions.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*

## Toxicity and harm potential

The toxicity and long-term health effects of recreational MiPT use do not seem to have been studied in any scientific context and the exact toxic dose is unknown. This is because MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human usage.

Anecdotal evidence from those who have tried MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

As with many psychedelics, the use of MiPT has the potential to bring about long-lasting perceptual and psychological alterations. MiPT, in particular, is known to chronically alter the perception of sound and talking, which may not be suitable for everyone.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

MiPT is not habit-forming and the desire to use it can actually decrease with regular consumption. Like with most [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelics) , it is most often thought to be self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

## Legal status

Due to its relative obscurity, the possession and sale of MiPT is unscheduled in most countries.

- **Germany** : MiPT is controlled under the NpSG ( *New Psychoactive Substances Act* ) as of July 18, 2019. Production and import with the aim to place it on the market, administration to another person and trading is punishable. Possession is illegal but not penalized.
- **Sweden** : Sweden's public health agency suggested classifying MiPT as a hazardous substance, on May 15, 2019.
- **Switzerland** : MiPT is not controlled under Buchstabe A, B, C and D. It could be considered legal.
- **United Kingdom** : MiPT is a Class A controlled substance in the United Kingdom as a result of the tryptamine catch-all clause.
- **United States** : MiPT is considered a schedule 1 controlled substance as a positional isomer of Diethyltryptamine (DET). MiPT is specifically mentioned by name in the DEA Orange Book , which lists all the controlled substances and other regulated chemicals in the US.
