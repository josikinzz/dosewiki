**5-Methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine** (also known as **5-MeO-MiPT** and **moxy** ) is a lesser-known [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) substance of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. 5-MeO-MiPT is chemically related to tryptamines like [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) and [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) . It produces its psychoactive effects through activity at [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) [receptors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Receptors) in the brain.

The synthesis and pharmacology of 5-MeO-MiPT was first reported in 1985 by David Repke and Alexander Shulgin. Its effects in humans was documented in Shulgin's book [TiHKAL](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/TiHKAL) ("Tryptamines I Have Known and Loved").

Anecdotal reports describe 5-MeO-MiPT's effects as highly [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulating) and mildly [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogenic) , lacking in typical psychedelic visual distortions. Many users report strong physical and tactile effects that serve to [enhance libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido) and sexual pleasure. An unpleasant "body load" is also often reported at common to high doses, marked by muscle tension and nausea.

Very little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism and toxicity of 5-MeO-MiPT, and it has a limited history of human use. It has been sold online as a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) . It is highly advised to use harm reduction practices when using this substance.

## Chemistry

5-MeO-MiPT, or 5-methoxy-N-methyl-N-isopropyltryptamine, is a synthetic indole alkaloid molecule of the [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) class. Tryptamines share a core structure comprised of a bicylic indole heterocycle attached at R 3 to an amino group via an ethyl side chain. 5-MeO-MiPT is substituted at R 5 of its indole heterocycle with a methoxy (MeO) functional group CH 3 O−; it also contains a methyl group and an isopropyl chain bound to the terminal amine R N of its tryptamine backbone (MiPT).

5-MeO-MiPT is the N-substituted isopropyl homologue of [5-MeO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DMT) .

## Pharmacology

5-MeO-MiPT's [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) effects are believed to come from its efficacy at the [5-HT2A receptor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin#The_5-HT_system) as a [partial agonist](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Agonist#Agonists) and additional mechanisms of action such as the inhibition of [MAO](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOI) (i.e. digestive enzymes in the stomach) have also been speculated upon, though this has yet to be demonstrated scientifically. While 5-MeO-MiPT binds most strongly to 5-HT1A receptors, It might act as a moderately potent serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor but other studies have not found significant action at the monoamine transporters . These mechanisms may help explain why there are many anecdotal reports of anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects from modest doses of this compound. For example, SNRIs such as venlafaxine are commonly prescribed to treat depression, and the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone is prescribed primarily for treatment of anxiety.

## Subjective effects

5-MeO-MiPT can be taken via oral ingestion or it can be smoked. When ingested orally, the visual and sensory effects are reported to become more prominent. The experience can be broken up into two stages; the first half feels [stimulating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and [entactogenic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Entactogens) whilst the second half feels more similar to a traditional [tryptamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tryptamine) [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) like psilocybin mushrooms or LSD. When smoked, the physically and cognitively stimulating effects become emphasized.

***Disclaimer:** The effects listed below cite the [Subjective Effect Index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effect_index) ( **SEI** ), an open research literature based on anecdotal user reports and the personal analyses of [PsychonautWiki](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/PsychonautWiki) [contributors](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Special:TopUsers) . As a result, they should be viewed with a healthy degree of skepticism.*

*It is also worth noting that these effects will not necessarily occur in a predictable or reliable manner, although higher doses are more liable to induce the full spectrum of effects. *Likewise, **adverse effects** become increasingly likely with higher doses and may include **addiction, severe injury, or death*** ☠.*
### Physical effects
 
- - **[Stimulation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulation)** - At doses below 10 to 15mg, 5-MeO-MiPT produces a degree of stimulation comparable to that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) .
- **[Spontaneous bodily sensations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Spontaneous_bodily_sensations)** - The "body high" of 5-MeO-MiPT can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing glow. This may be accompanied by a cold, sharp tingling sensation that manifests spontaneously at different unpredictable points throughout the experience, although for others can maintain a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **[Nausea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Nausea)** - Nausea is commonly reported and can sometimes result in vomiting, although it typically fades after the come up phase. In comparison to [5-MeO-DiPT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/5-MeO-DiPT) , this substance has a much lower tendency to trigger unpleasant physical reactions.
- **[Bodily pressures](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Bodily_pressures)**
- **[Abnormal heartbeat](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Abnormal_heartbeat)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Increased heart rate](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_heart_rate)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]

- **[Headaches](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Headaches)** [*[citation needed](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Citation_needed)*]
- **[Dehydration](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dehydration)**
- **[Stomach bloating](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stomach_bloating)** - At higher doses, this compound can induce severe stomach bloating within those who are susceptible. This can be partially to fully mitigated through the use of antacids.
- **[Pupil dilation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pupil_dilation)**
- **[Vasoconstriction](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction)**
- **[Diarrhea](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Diarrhea)** ### Visual effects
 
- #### Enhancements
 
- **[Colour enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_enhancement)**
- **[Pattern recognition enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Pattern_recognition_enhancement)**
- **[Visual acuity enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_acuity_enhancement)**
 
#### Distortions
 
- **[Drifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting)** *( [Melting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Melting) , [Breathing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Breathing) , [Warping](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Warping) and [Flowing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_drifting#Flowing) )* - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in appearance.
- **[Tracers](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Tracers)**
- **[After images](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/After_images)**
- **[Symmetrical texture repetition](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Symmetrical_texture_repetition)**
- **[Colour shifting](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Colour_shifting)**
- **[Scenery slicing](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenery_slicing)**
 
#### Geometry
 
The visual geometry produced by 5-MeO-MiPT can be described as more similar in appearance to that of [Psilocin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psilocin) , [4-AcO-DMT](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/4-AcO-DMT) or [ayahuasca](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Ayahuasca) than that of [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) or [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) . It can be comprehensively described through its [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Geometry#Variations) as intricate in complexity, abstract in form, organic in feel, brightly lit, multicoloured in scheme, glossy in shading, equal in blurred and sharp edges, large in size, fast in speed, smooth in motion, equal in rounded and angular corners, non-immersive in depth and progressive in intensity. At higher dosages they are significantly more likely to result in states of [level 8B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8B_Geometry) visual geometry over [level 8A](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/8A_Geometry) .
 
#### Hallucinatory states
 
5-MeO-MiPT produces a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics.
 
- **[Transformations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Transformations)**
- **[Internal hallucination](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Internal_hallucination)** ( *[autonomous entities](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Autonomous_entities)* ; *[settings, sceneries, and landscapes](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Settings,_sceneries,_and_landscapes)* ; *[perspective hallucinations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Perspective_hallucinations)* and *[scenarios and plots](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Scenarios_and_plots)* ) - In comparison to other psychedelics such as [LSD](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/LSD) , 5-MeO-MiPT is extremely high in hallucinations at appropriate dosages. These are more common in darkness and can be comprehensibly described through their [variations](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Visual_effects:_Internal_hallucinations#Variations) as lucid in believability, interactive in style, new experiences in content, autonomous in controllability, geometry-based in style and almost exclusively of a personal, religious, spiritual, science-fiction, fantasy, surreal, nonsensical or transcendental nature in their overall theme. ### Cognitive effects
 
- At low to moderate doses, the cognitive effects of 5-MeO-MiPT are often described by many as both insightful and moderately relaxing, but at some points quite stimulating. 5-MeO-MiPT produces a large number of typical [psychedelic](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) cognitive effects which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. At higher dosages, however, it becomes primarily sedating and impairing with [depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization) and no accompanying insight. 
- **[Analysis enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Analysis_enhancement)**
- **[Empathy, affection, and sociability enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Empathy,_affection,_and_sociability_enhancement)** - This effect is consistently manifested only in the context of social settings in which one is within the company of others. These feelings of sociability, love and empathy are a little weaker and less sharp than those found on substances such as [MDMA](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MDMA) and [2C-B](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/2C-B) but still prove strong enough to provide long-lasting therapeutic effects.
- **[Depersonalization](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Depersonalization)** - Unlike most traditional psychedelics, 5-MeO-MiPT can cause extreme depersonalization and dissociation for some users throughout the duration of the experience.
- **[Conceptual thinking](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Conceptual_thinking)**
- **[Increased music appreciation](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_music_appreciation)**
- **[Emotion enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Emotion_enhancement)**
- **[Increased libido](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Increased_libido)** - increased libido and significantly enhanced orgasms are reported
- **[Memory suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Memory_suppression)**
- **[Novelty enhancement](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Novelty_enhancement)**
- **[Personal bias suppression](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Personal_bias_suppression)**

### Experience reports

There are currently no anecdotal reports which describe the effects of this compound within our [experience index](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Experience_index) . Additional experience reports can be found here:

## Reagent results

Exposing compounds to the reagents gives a colour change which is indicative of the compound under test. The following test results are from [ProTestKit](https://www.protestkit.eu/results/) .

## Toxicity and harm potential

Almost nothing is known about the long-term effects of 5-MeO-MiPT. Alongside of this, the exact toxic dosage is unknown. This is because 5-MeO-MiPT is a [research chemical](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Research_chemical) with very little history of human use.

A preliminary study on mice has shown that a normal dose of 5-MeO-MiPT (0.27 mg/kg) was unable to produce any measurable toxic effects. However, doses of 5-MeO-MiPT way above the normal dosage range (2.7 mg/kg) have been shown to produce cell toxicity by triggering programmed cell death in the brain, liver and kidneys. The extent of the damage, if it occurs in other bodily tissues as well and how it is caused is not known yet.

Anecdotal evidence from people within the community who have tried 5-MeO-MiPT suggests that there are no negative health effects attributed to simply trying the drug by itself at low to moderate doses and using it very sparingly (but nothing can be completely guaranteed). [Independent research](https://www.google.com/) should always be done to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe before consumption.

It is strongly recommended that one use [harm reduction practices](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Responsible_drug_use) when using this drug.

### Tolerance and addiction potential

5-MeO-MiPT is not habit-forming, and the desire to use it can actually decrease with use. It is most often self-regulating.

Tolerance to the effects of 5-MeO-MiPT is built almost immediately after ingestion. After that, it takes about 3 days for the tolerance to be reduced to half and 7 days to be back at baseline (in the absence of further consumption). 5-MeO-MiPT presents cross-tolerance with all [psychedelics](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychedelic) , meaning that after the consumption of 5-MeO-MiPT all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.

### Dangerous interactions

***Warning:*** *Many psychoactive substances that are reasonably safe to use on their own can suddenly become dangerous and even life-threatening when combined with certain other substances. The following list provides some known dangerous interactions (although it is not guaranteed to include all of them).*

*Always conduct independent research (e.g. [Google](https://www.google.com) , [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) , [PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) ) to ensure that a combination of two or more substances is safe to consume. Some of the listed interactions have been sourced from [TripSit](https://combo.tripsit.me) .*

- **2C-T-X** - Both classes of compounds can be unpredictable alone.
- **2C-X** - The 5-MeO psychedelics can interact unpredictably to potentiate other psychedelics.
- **Cannabis** - May increase the risk of negative psychological effects such as [anxiety](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Anxiety) , [paranoia](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Paranoia) , and [psychosis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Psychosis) .
- **DOx** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions, particularly increasing the risk of unpleasant physical side effects.
- **MDMA** - Some of the 5-MeO tryptamines are a bit unpredictable and should be mixed with MDMA with care.
- **Mescaline** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions.
- **NBOMe** - The 5-MeO class of tryptamines can be unpredictable in their interactions and the NBOMes are known to be unpredictable even alone. This combination is best avoided.
- **Amphetamines** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **Cocaine** - The anxiogenic and focusing effects of stimulants increase the chance of unpleasant thought loops. The combination is generally unnecessary because of the stimulating effects of psychedelics.
- **DXM** - Little information exists about this combination.
- **Tramadol** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **aMT** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **MAOIs** - Increased risk of [serotonin syndrome](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) .
- **PCP** - Little information exists about this combination. May increase risk of psychosis and excessive stimulation.

There are no known deaths from 5-MeO-MiPT but, as a [monoamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Monoamine) [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) (MRI) , injury could occur when excessive doses are taken or when it is taken with drugs such as [MAOIs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/MAOIs) , [RIMAs](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/RIMA) , [stimulants](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Stimulant) and any substance which act as a [releasing agent](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Releasing_agent) or [reuptake inhibitor](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Reuptake_inhibitor) of [neurotransmitters](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Neurotransmitters) such as [serotonin](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Serotonin) and [dopamine](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Dopamine) .
