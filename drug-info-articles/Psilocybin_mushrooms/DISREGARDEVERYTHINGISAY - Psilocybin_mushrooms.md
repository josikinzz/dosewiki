(Mushrooms)

Psilocin is a naturally occurring tryptamine psychedelic found within approximately 190 separate species of mushroom and growing on every continent across the planet. Psychedelic mushrooms have been in use since before recorded human history with their depiction being found on cave art and famously used by the native people of Mesoamerica for religious and shamanic purposes.

There are two separate chemicals found within mushrooms in roughly equal amounts. They are both classed as substituted tryptamine alkaloids and serotonergic psychedelic drugs, but it’s important to note that only psilocin is directly active. The other substance, psilocybin, is instead a pro-drug of the pharmacologically active substance psilocin and converted directly into it within the liver. Once the molecule has been converted into psilocin, it acts as a partial agonist for several serotonergic receptors. Psilocin has a high affinity for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the brain where it mimics the effects of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT).

The psilocin experience contains a complex and wide array of effects which based on the predefined potential subjective effects index found [here](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Subjective_effects_index), I will now begin to breakdown and describe the chemical.

**Physical Effects:**

The physical effects of Psilocin can be broken down into two components all of which progressively intensify proportional to dosage. These are described below and generally include:

- **Spontaneous tactile sensations** - The body high of psilocin can be described as a pleasurable, warm, soft and all-encompassing tingling sensation. This maintains a consistent presence that steadily rises with the onset and hits its limit once the peak has been reached.
- **Sedation** - In terms of its effects on the physical energy levels of the tripper, psilocin is considered by most to be relaxing, stoning and mildly sedating. This sense of sedation is often accompanied by compulsive yawning, a runny nose and watering eyes.

**Cognitive Effects:**

The head space of psilocin is described by many as extremely relaxing, profound and stoning in its style when compared to other commonly used psychedelics such as LSD or 2C-B which tend to be energetic and stimulating. It contains a large number of psychedelic typical and unique cognitive effects.

The most prominent of these typical effects generally include:

- **Enhancement of current mind state**
- **Connectivity of thought**
- **Feelings of fascination, importance and awe**
- **Time distortion**
- **Outrospection 
**
- **Deja-Vu**
- **Removal of cultural filter**
- **Feelings of predeterminism**
- **Conceptual thinking**
- **Direct communication with the subconsious**
- **Ego suppression, loss and death**
- **Feelings of interdependent opposites**
- **Delusions**
- **States of unity and interconnectedness**
- **Enhancement and suppression cycles - **This can be described as constant waves of extremely stimulated and profound thinking which are spontaneously surpassed in a cyclic fashion by waves of general thought suppression and mental intoxication. These two states seem to switch between each other in a consistent loop once every 20 - 60 minutes.

**Visual Effects:**

*Enhancements*

Psilocin presents a full and complete array of possible visual enhancements which generally include:

- **Increased visual acuity**
- **Enhancement of colours**
- **Enhanced pattern recognition**

*Distortions*

As for visual distortions and alterations, effects experienced are detailed below:

- **Visual drifting** (*melting, flowing, breathing and morphing*) - In comparison to other psychedelics, this effect can be described as highly detailed, slow and smooth in motion and static in its appearance.
- **Tracers**
- **After images**
- **Texture repetition**
- **Colour shifting**
- **Scenery slicing**

*Geometry*

The visual geometry that is present throughout this trip can be described as more similar in appearance to that of 4-AcO-DMT, Ayahuasca and 2C-E than LSD. It can be comprehensively described as structured in its organization, organic in geometric style, intricate in complexity, large in size, fast and smooth in motion, colourful in scheme, glossy in colour, blurred in its edges and rounded in its corners. They have a very “natural” feel to them and at higher dosages are significantly more likely to result in states of Level 7B visual geometry over Level 7A.

*Hallucinatory States*

Psilocin and its various other forms produce a full range of high level hallucinatory states in a fashion that is more consistent and reproducible than that of many other commonly used psychedelics. These effects generally include:

- **External hallucinations**
- **Internal hallucinations** - This particular effect commonly contains hallucinations with scenarios, landscapes, settings, concepts and autonomous entity contact. They are more common within dark environments and can be described as internal in their manifestation, lucid in believability, interactive in style and almost exclusively of religious, spiritual, mystical or a transcendental nature in their overall theme.

**Auditory Effects:**

The auditory effects of psilocin are common in their occurrence and exhibit a full range of effects which commonly include:

- **Enhancements**
- **Distortions**
- **Hallucinations**

**Health Effects, Addiction Potential and Tolerance:**

The toxicity of psilocybin, psilacetin and psilocin is extremely low. In rats, the median lethal dose (LD50) of psilocybin when administered orally is 280 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Psilocybin comprises approximately 1% of the weight of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, so nearly 1.7 kilograms (3.7 lb) of dried mushrooms or 17 kilograms (37 lb) of fresh mushrooms would be required for a 60-kilogram (130 lb) person to reach the 280 mg/kg LD50 value of rats. Based on the results of animal studies, the lethal dose of psilocybin has been extrapolated to be 6 grams which is 1000 times greater than the effective dose of 6 milligrams.

There are no known long term physical effects from ingestion of mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin.

Keep in mind that psychedelic mushrooms are non-habit-forming and that the desire to use them can actually decrease with use. They are most often self-regulating. You also build an almost immediate tolerance to them after ingestion, preventing you from experiencing their full effects for more often than every 4-7 days (unless you increase your dose significantly). 

**Legal issues:**

- Psilocybin mushrooms are regulated or prohibited in many countries, often carrying severe legal penalties (for example, the U.S. Psychotropic Substances Act, the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and Drugs Act 2005 and the Canadian Controlled Drugs and Substances Act).
- Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances.
- On November 29, 2008, the Netherlands announced it would ban the cultivation and use of psilocybin-containing fungi beginning December 1, 2008.
- The UK ban on fresh mushrooms (dried ones were already illegal as they were considered a psilocybin-containing preparation) was introduced in 2005.
- The New Mexico appeals court ruled on June 14, 2005, that growing psilocybin mushrooms for personal consumption could not be considered “manufacturing a controlled substance” under state law. However it still remains illegal under federal law.
- 4-ACO-DMT is unscheduled in the United States. It may be considered an analog of psilocin under the Federal Analog Act.
- 4-ACO-DMT could also be considered illegal in the UK under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. 4-ACO-DMT is an ester of psilocin (to which it metabolizes into). This means that it potentially carries the same penalty as any Class A drug.

If you want to try psilocin despite the legal issues you have multiple options. You can purchase them through a street dealer, grow them yourself using this guide here or you can pick them fresh in your local area during the correct season if you know where to look for them.
If you want to try 4-ACO-DMT despite the legal issues, you can find it for sale through the power of Google. It sold online to the masses through various research chemical vendors who I cannot legally mention the names of.

**Conclusion:**

Psilocin is one of my favourite psychedelics and is best used in silent darkness and in high doses to fully release its hallucinatory effects. Mushrooms are slightly more capable of producing bad trips in people who are inexperienced with psychedelics as they can be a little more confusing. However, they are extremely rewarding in terms of head space, allowing for extremely deep philosophical thoughts and realizations that I have not found with any other substance.
