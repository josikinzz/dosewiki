DESCRIPTION #
 
General Effects Notes
 The effects of 3-MeO-PCP are usually compared to [ketamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/ketamine/) and other dissociatives like [PCP](https://erowid.org/chemicals/pcp) , [methoxetamine](https://erowid.org/chemicals/methoxetamine/) , etc. 
 
 3-MeO-PCP is reported as more physically stimulating than ketamine and other psychedelic dissociatives. Where ketamine causes people to be physically sedated and incapacitated at strong doses, 3-MeO-PCP's powerful effects on the mind can be accompanied by standing up, walking around, talking, and potentially doing dangerous activities. 
 
 
Routes of Administration
 3-MeO-PCP is taken via insufflation, sublingually, IM (intramuscular) and orally, and there are reports of rectal and IV (intravenous) use. 
 
 
Addiction and Compulsive Use
 Although 3-MeO-PCP can trigger a desire to redose and/or to take the drug again in the near future, users should be very careful about redosing too frequently. The lag between administration and effects can result in much stronger effects than desired or expected. Because of its short history of human use and lack of experimental research, no definitive statements can be made about the risk of addiction and/or compulsive use across a wide cross section of users.
 
EXPERIENCE EXCERPTS #
 
[6 mg oral] "I did fumble around a bit when walking, but in general I was able to function quite well and did not have any problem whatsoever walking and carrying conversation with others. My friends did not know I had ingested this compound, and I believe they did not suspect it." -- [102457](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=102457)
 
[20 mg oral] "20mg of this stuff alone, or 8 beers alone, produces in me a very controllable state with little to no amnesia. 20mg + 8 beers in retrospect should have seemed like a bad idea to me, but at the time felt like a good idea. i blacked out for a few hours." -- [Bluelight](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/697059-The-Big-amp-Dandy-3-MeO-PCP-Thread-Part-2?p=12104981&viewfull=1#post12104981)
 
[35 mg IM] "Once I got some 3 meo and hadn't taken dissociatives for months. I did 35 mg IM and walked the dogs... rather the dogs walked me. How I didn't end up in hospital or jail and actually survived to make it home is a mystery." -- [Bluelight](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/697059-The-Big-amp-Dandy-3-MeO-PCP-Thread-Part-2?p=12438011&viewfull=1#post12438011)

DOSAGE DESCRIPTION #
 
Caution : Dose information should not be taken as recommendations. [ see below ]
 
**3-MeO-PCP Dosages**
**Oral**
**( tentative, without tolerance )**
- Threshold: 1 - 3 mg
- Light: 3 - 10 mg
- Common: 8 - 18 mg
- Strong: 12 - 22 mg
- Heavy: 18 - 30+ mg
 
**3-MeO-PCP Dosages**
**Nasal / Insufflated**
**( tentative, without tolerance )**
- Threshold: 1 - 3 mg
- Light: 3 - 10 mg
- Common: 8 - 18 mg
- Strong: 12 - 22 mg
- Heavy: 18 - 30+ mg
 
 
Erowid's estimated doses for 3-MeO-PCP are higher than the dose summaries provided by some other organizations. It is extremely important to note that strong or heavy doses of 3-MeO-PCP can cause powerful deleriant-type effects where the user is unaware that their perceptions, thoughts, and ideas are false or hallucinatory. Many people describe "psychosis"-like symptoms at doses in the strong and heavy range. When compared to ketamine, one of the primary differences is that people remain ambulatory (able to walk) at fully hallucinatory effects levels of 3-MeO-PCP. 
 
 In our review of reports, most people who like 3-MeO-PCP seem to report preferring light to common dose levels and avoid higher doses or mixing 3-MeO-PCP with sedatives, in order to avoid delusional, delirious states. While every individual reacts differently, the difference between 10 mg and 20 mg can be the difference between light euphoric inebriation and the delirious inability to tell whether a car is real or not. 
 
 Note that [Bluelight's Big and Dandy 3-MeO-PCP Thread - Part 2](http://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/697059-The-Big-amp-Dandy-3-MeO-PCP-Thread-Part-2) warns about risks of taking too much 3-MeO-PCP and suggests individuals should "slowly work [their] way up to about 10 mg, and only after considerable experience / expertise proceed to maybe 15 mg, with SMALL STEPS." 
 
 3-MeO-PCP is a dissociative. That means that what many people are looking for is an effect that is be experienced lying or sitting down. Doses as low as 10 or 15 mg in someone without tolerance could cause walking to be clumsy and potentially dangerous if unsupervised.
 
CAUTION & DISCLAIMER #
 
Every individual reacts differently to every chemical.
