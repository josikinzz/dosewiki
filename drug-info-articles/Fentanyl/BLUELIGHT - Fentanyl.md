Great job, thanks for putting this together! And thanks for including my extraction thread. ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png) This was long overdue, I think all the major stronger opioids are covered for with megathreads now. I'm not sure if there are megatreads for the weaker opiods and if not should they be made? There are a lot of basic posts about hydrocodone, codeine, and tramadol all the time and it might reduce a good deal of clutter.

**Got an open fentanyl patch, what now?**


So last night one of my friends came over with a 100mcg/h fentanyl patch.  Well he only had one, and we both wanted to get fucked up, so just putting the patch on wasnt really gunna work.  So i cut a corner and started smoking it.  I would smoke bb sized dabs at a time, but it never really got me messed up much?  I would say i smoked maybe 5-6 bb's throughout the night, and rubbed one one my gums.  I have zero tolerance to this stuff, this is my first time messing with anything like this.


I didnt want to just keep smoking it all night because i know how dangerous this stuff can be, and didnt want to overdo it.


ANYWAY, i still have 75% of the gel left in the patch.  what should i do with it now?  keep smoking it?  rub it on my gums?  Try to seal the hole with tape and stick it to me?


also, i left it open all night, will that affect it?

**Switching to fentnyl from Oxy**


I've been taking 20mgs OC x3 a day for 6 months, Getting switched to fentnyl patches due to poor digestion of the ER tablets of OC. What MCG should i get? i've been on them before and was up to 100mcg/3 days but i doubt my doc will start me that high..

they always start you off really low on the fentanyl. i was taking 120mg of oxy a day and they still tried starting me off on the 25mcg Try telling the dr. you've been on it before. You probably won't get the 100mcg but maybe you'll get lucky and get the 75 instead of the 25mcg ones. good luck

I used to be on 30 mgs of oxy 2x a day and 2 mgs of Dilaudid for breakthrough pain, and my doc put me on 50 mcg/hr for 3 days so I couldn't abuse the medicine. I'd start there probably, but you can always get a higher dosage with time.

you'll likely be started on 25mcg/hr and work up slowly to an effective dose.  you'll need nowhere near 100mcg/hr initally because of your current tolerance.  


fentanyl is generally the last resort with pain management so keep your dosage as low as possible while using them for treatment as other opiatesd basically become ineffective even for breakthrough pain.

i have heard of people freezing it and eating little bits at a time.


You can also dissolve the gel and adhesive (bc like 20mcg are on the adhesive itself) with rubbing alcohol on a plate and then when it drys, you can scrape up the white granules w a razor blade.  UTFSE for more thorough instructions.  I think I got that from erowid.org years ago.  I vaporized it in a glass pipe used for meth.  


If you have a low tolerance, be very careful- bc a little goes a long way.  Non-opiate tolerant people can easily have a fatal overdose from fentanyl.

since you've left the patch overnight, unsealed it will have lost some potency.


the safest way to use these is by taking a tiny sized dab and using it bucally (between your cheeks).  hold it in there, for around 20 mins, without swallowing your mucous otherwise it's going to be absorbed orally.

I was started at 100mcg but was on a huge dose of OC and 4 30mg oxycodone's at the time. As far as taking it recreationally, I took it by taking the gel and rubbing it around my mouth, the gums, the inside of the cheeks, or I would put it under my tongue. It worked that way, but I didnt enjoy the effects as compared with drugs like oxycodone. Im not sure how smoking it would compare, or if smoking the gel is a waste like I believe smoking pills like OC is.  Leaving it out overnight open will probably dry some of the med up causing a loss.

for people scripted for a few years, when you are on one brand for a long time, have you noticed if you have to change brands it doesnt work as well.


going from watson, sandoz to mylan is awful! it doesnt work.


im having problems going from watson to sandoz... in theory one shouldnt have a problem, but here i am... im def in wd stages right now, tho ive been on this dosage for over a year, the only change was from watson to sandoz..


strange...

**smokin mylan fentanyl patch**


usually scrape the silicone off with my thumbnail, the words come off the patch along with it, and then vaporize it on tin foil and inhale with a pen tube


ive heard people say that there is little to no fent in the goop you scrape off but it is the part that touches your skin so there has to be some... ive also heard people say the goop is where the fentanyl is actually contained


all i know is that when i used to take 1 hit i would feel very "opiated" that nice warm opiate feeling in my brain, and it kind of wears off after a couple minutes even though i remain "fucked up" for a few hours... so i would take a hit every couple of minutes to feel that nice opioid feeling... but my tolerance is now so high that i have to smoke like half the goop to get that feeling that doesnt last very long


so my question is does anyone know how harmful this is and does the goop that i scrape off indeed contain the majority of the fentanyl, im pretty sure my heart beats funny for the rest of the day after smoking it i actually decided to quit smoking it altogether out of fear and now only use pill form opioids, but ive smoked atleast 40-50, 25 mcg patches total


so have i irreperably damaged myself?

Well smoking the gel from the brand/sandoz patches seems to be bad enough, i have a few friends that have permanent respiratory problems now after abusing those chronically, I mean none of this stuff is supposed to be smoked.  I guess the only advice I can give you is to go see a doctor and see if theres anything wrong with your respiratory system, I dont know anyone who even attempted to smoke the Mylan patches, they always used the gel ones. And if they were going to abuse to Mylan ones, they would cut them into pieces and stick them on their gums.

yeah i guess i will go to the doctor and have my lungs checked... after reading some stuff about the dangers of silicone inhalation that stonecutters get i got scared and stopped doing them, its been several months since the last time i did it and im not really having any lung symptoms that i can think of


i know a lot of people around this area who smoke the mylan patches the way i described which is how i learned how to do it


the only thing is im getting worried cuz i got no pills left and am going to w/d from long term methadone use very soon and all i got are mylan patches... i suppose i could try sticking one on, never actually tried that

That would actually work fine, ive used patches to taper down many times. Your in an even better position because you have the mylan ones so you can cut them into halves and quarters and taper very slowly. If I did that with the sandoz ones I have the gel would leak out.

Don't smoke the mylan patches, man..  Inhaling all that plastic/silicone shit has got to be horrible for your respiratory system.  I hope you don't end up doing any kind of damage to your health because of it.  If you are dead set on smoking fent get the patches with the gel.


Wearing them will take quite a long time to "kick in" (like 8 hours) but it will last quite some time. So in regards to your withdrawals, it will definitely keep them at bay for much longer if you wear it in lieu of attempting to smoke it.

Ok (aside from what everyone else has already said) let me get this strait..You were vaping an opiod, obviously getting opiated from it and you're asking if you were vaping an opiate? ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


Vaping that gel was never meant to be a daily occurance. I only did that a few times in my life, because of course smoking that shit isn't good for your lungs, as it's in no way a pure product, come on man.  If you get a fent patch, filter and IV (uh, actually don't do this unless you're reading this and laughing because you do this all the time) or WEAR THE DAMNED THING!

Having had a lot of experience with patches of all sorts, i have tried smoking gel from the old patches i used to get, once i started only being able to get gel-less patches i stopped smoking them- as has already been noted, you have to smoke the adhesive itself to get the fentanyl. At that point i found i liked extracting the fent from the adhesive with isopropyl and injecting, makes for a mighty nice shot ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

if you're going to continue smoking these fent patches then i definitely recommend you do an extraction on the patches.  there's a link at the bottom of the OP in the fent megathread where i'm merging this now.

Smoking fent gel (when they are fresh and not worn for three days) is an amazing high, almost like a shot. But I realize that could lead to a very very expensive habit. I agree with DexterMeth. Just wear the damn thing! I enjoy just wearing a 100mcg patch for three days, not having to worry about scoring and getting a decent nod out of it. I haven't nodded out on anything that wasn't fentanyl in a few years now. That goes to show what tolerance does to a person. Onsolis, the new fent patch that is indicated to be used buccally and the fent nasal spray all seem to have been derived from how we junkies have abused the fent preparations that have already been out. Snorting and cheeking...whoda thunk it?

In my experience, with a GEL patch, I find the most effective way to do it( I don't shoot), is to squirt out a little bit, onto the end of a popsicle stick, stick that up my nose and snort. Then repeat every 5 minutes until satisfied.  I have been very happy with the results.


I find smoking the gel is a complete waste.


The gel-less patches, I have tried pouring boiling water onto them and drinking the water.

Not that great. I hate those.

I appreciate the thread you wrote on extracting the patches.


I am new here.


If one was to simply leave a patch like that in a cup of vodka for an hour, would that work?


I don't shoot, and want to find another way.

You smoked a hit? Off of tin foil? I can't fathom you overdosing on that if you do 160mg of Oxy at a time.

You should be fine.

My wife just tried fentanyl for the first time ever. She's addicted to opiates. The dose she took was approximately 1000 micrograms iv. It didn't make her withdrawals go away. About all it did was make her itch. As we're not familiar with fentanyl and what to expect from it, we'd like to ask before she takes more should the effect be similarish to heroin? I mean, do you know if the dose is correct if coming up on this thing feels the same as with heroin?

Interesting, my experience was very much the same. I used the 100mcg patchs for a little while last year, I took the gel and moved around my mouth and gums and under the tongue.  I wasnt a fan mainly because it did not give me the same high that I was used to feeling with OC and Opana, or even methadone. The fentanyl high was not enjoyable for me, I kept using more and more of it until it was obvious the drug was in my system but just not giving me the feeling I wanted. 


If I remember correctly I felt a strong body buzz, it effected my walking and made me feel a bit clumsy and off.  But I never got a good high and like your wife I even had what felt like WD symptoms. I had a very high tolerance so I gave it a couple more tries and used even more of it, I was going to get high. I used a lot, I dont remember how much, but  it messed me up, to the point where I was a little scared of an OD, I had to lay down from it, but still no euphoria and still the feeling of WD symptoms. I gave up on it and I think I got some OC's at the time, I blew an 80 or maybe a little more and right away the difference was apparent, that euphoric high came on and that WD feeling disappeared. 


I would think that Fentanyl would stop WD since it is an opiate. Maybe because it didnt give that euphoric feeling it felt like I was in WD. Some people really like fentanyl, so maybe it just wasnt for me.

Imo if all other opiate agonists feel warm and fuzzy, fentanyl feels cold and empty.

Fent powder isn't readily available in pure form from pharm companies like the patches are.  It's often (along with a bunch of different fent analogues) in batches of east coast heroin, or even just itself with some white inert cuts though.  I used to vap the gel every once in a while, only small amounts to initiate a high and when eat and wear the rest to make it last and save my lungs.  A tiny little bead of that gel is not going to hurt your lungs.  If you did a lot of it and/or all the time you would most likely run into problems though, obviously I'd think.

Thanks for the replies. We tried fentanyl as morphine has done nothing except kept my wife's withdrawals away in ages, OC doesn't do even that and H was not available. Fentanyl doesn't seem to be her thing either, but we'll give it a one more try with a much larger dose. I think we were being too careful, knowing her tolerance, because of all the people we've heard die from fentanyl OD.

Hi all. I have had a Morphine habit for about a year now. I weigh 135lbs and take between 120-165 mgs a day (throughout a day, not all at once), and have been taking this dosage for a good 5-6 months. My tolerance seems to have stayed put, as I take Morphine (or Oxy, when M isn't available to me) on a daily basis, yet throughout a day I never exceed 180, and the only time it reaches that amount is when I have to wake up earlier than I normally do. 

Now, I just acquired a Sandoz 100mcg/h Fentanyl patch. I realize that my tolerance to Morphine isn't *that* high, but I was wondering, if I were to wear this patch, is it possible for me to run into any problems, or should I be able to wear it without having to worry about my CNS slowing down to a dangerous point? I planned on saving this patch until my Morphine supply runs out, so I know I will have a large backlog of it stored up in my body. 

Any advice here is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

i'd cut it into 4 even quarters, so 25mcg/hr pieces.  trust me, you will get 4 x 3day uses out of that.  im prescribed 120mg mscontin a day and i was on fentanyl before being on morphine and therapeutically 25mcg patches are sufficient.  if you need something for breakthrough, chew 20mg of morphine.  my recreational tolerances are a lot higher, but for legitimate use they are the right doses.

So I could actually cut the patch into 1/4ths and still wear them and be fine?? That's interesting, thank you.

If it's a gel type patch that you have it can't be cut into pieces.

I don't think it's a gel one, as it seems to be flat as paper, but I haven't opened it yet. So I'm not sure.

Those are the Fentanyl patchs I used before, they are gel patches. They do seem very flat, but they are filled with gel.

Thats sooo not true. Anytime I get a patch I cut in 2 pieces because a full patch is usually to much and I end up taking it off 7 hours later. Just cut it and tape it and make sure theres no leaking and no air gets in the patch. Its worked everytime for me and ive done it quite a bit.


I also stick a hotpad on until I see my pupils getting very constricted then I wait till I feel a buzz coming on and stop.

^cutting the patch in pieces is going to potentially speed up the absorption rate of the fentanyl (it leaking out much quicker), which is itself a risk even with transdermal fentanyl.  if you're smoking your gel then sure, cut it and store what you're not using properly.  you could do the same using tiny blobs for buccal use.  try and find suitable smaller dosage patches to wear.

I'm getting some Actiq lollipops some time later this week and I find them not very effective for pain and they are so short acting that any relief they do provide only lasts like 2 hours..


Is there any way to get more out of these? I rub them on the inside of my cheek, under my tongue, and the inside of my bottom lip.  I am very careful not to swallow much of the spit but of course a small amount gets away. A friend of mine who used to have them said he used the cut the lollipop part off and sit it under his tongue. Is this better?


Thanks.

Good Morning,

I can aquire following patches:

**Durogesic®, Depopatch 50 mikrog/HOUR**

They are the ones with no gél inside them.

IS  there ANY way to extract some fentanyl out for injection?


And does it give more fenanyl at the same timr if i cut the patch in pieces and place on my body?


And lastly, wouls it yield a more rapid and strong effect if i took a piece of thr patch and used it sublingual. (maybe with some strong liqour to absorb it?


Thanks!


**EDIT**: Think i found the answers to my questions, thanks.

There are many ways to best take fentanyl listed in the posts on this page. I believe avoiding to swallow the fentanyl is best for Hobo with the lollipops. They have a page on wikipedia I havent read, the page is below, I would read it. As for the patch with no gel, I used the ones with gel so I dont know about cutting them, but they will have a stronger and faster onset if put in the mouth and absorbed by the gums, inside of the cheeks, and under the tongue. They are dangerous when used that way because of fentanyls strength so you must be careful especially if not experienced.

**Fentanyl Patches**


I've read with great interest many of the posts here.  I have a somewhat different question to ask.  I've come across some 12.5 mcg Fentanyl patches and am not looking for a "buzz."  I just want pain relief.


The warning labels scare the heck out of me as they make it seem like that unless you are VERY opiate tolerant then one of these patches will kill you dead.  (slight exaggeration).


I have been on 5mg of oxycodone a couple of times a day, but that's it.


Coming here I've seen talk of eating 100mcg gel patches and other (seemingly) insane acts.


That leads me to believe that simply using a 12.5 patch would be relatively safe.


I'm about 220, in generally good health other than this current back pain.  Any thoughts, advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

i take it this did not come from a doctor...


i would first talk to your (assumed) pain mgmt specialist (or the person who prescribes the oxy)


Otherwise, if you decide to put this on your body, it will be similar to max 1.25mg/hr morphine


talk to a specialist

So about 10-15mg of oxycodone a day, and your going to try and take on fentanyl?


However 15mg of oxycodone is roughly equal to about 0.02-0.06mg of fentanyl.


12.5mcg = 0.0125mg


So you will not overdose, might even be a chance there will be no pain relief.


Unless I read the dosage incorrectly.

there will definitely be pain relief.  it's recommended for people not to start taking fentanyl (the proper way like the OP) unless they've been on the equivalent of 40mg oxy a day for 2 weeks.


i would cut the patch into quarters if you've only ever taken 5mg oxy in the past.  it will be more than sufficient for pain.  if after 24 hours the first quarter isn't enough relief then add another quarter.  remember they're only 72 hour patches as well.

So is there any way to use the fentanyl lollipops more effectively? i already use them without swallowing any saliva and it takes like 30-45 minutes for me to finish one.  in the packaging that comes with them it tells you to suck on it and swallow the shit but it cuts the bioavailability down to 33%.  


I've seen references to shooting them on here, but no explaination on if there are any extra steps.  or is it as straightforward as i am thinking it is?  Each unit contains 2g of sugar, is that a problem?


if anyone could walk me through this i would be greatful.  I know i could probably figure it out, but i don't want to take any chances when injecting lollipops into my veins...


Also, if the pops aren't safe to inject, does anyone have any info on the rectal bioavailability of fentanyl?


EDIT: Fuck rectal administration, i just read that intranasal BA of fentanyl saline solution is 89%.  I guess i need to find a flonase bottle or something...

yeah, i've heard they cause a lot of dental problems.  i only use them for like 5-7 days a month while i wait on my script and i haven't noticed any tooth decay yet.  Drink what gel?  i don't have patches, just lollipops. if i had gel i would be smoking it right now and not worrying about injecting lollipops...

**Fentanyl WD Help!**


Hey gang, 


I'm beginning quitting cold turkey from a low dose (50ucg/48hrs) of Fentanyl.  Got a couple of questions, if anyone has any experience to share, I would be humbly greatful.


First, can I expect serious withdrawl from using such a low dose for roughly 2 years time?  Second, if i had either hydrocodone or oxycodone to help ease the pain, which would provide better relief (provided I had equal amounts).


Thanks, and have good.

You will indeed have w/d. Using any dose of X drug that is addictive for a timeframe of 2 years, will give you w/d. If you use oxy or any other narcotic, it would be pointless. Its basically the same drug. and you are just prolonging the w/d. 


No one can tell you how bad it will be, everyone is different, but yes, you will experience w/d.

expect acute, painful withdrawals for 3 days maximum.  that should be all the physical side effects out of the way and then you'll be left with PAWS most likely - so try and have some hobbies going if you don't already - exercise, eating healthy, studying, etc


by taking the other opiates you'll alleviate some of the physical symptoms but you're only prolonging the wd in the end.  try and take minimal doses at times when you only really need them to avoid dragging the affair on too long.  maybe get some OTC aids and/or benzos to help with the anxieties.

I would ask your doctor if you could drop to the 25mcg patch for a couple weeks and then the 12.5mcg patch for a couple weeks before coming off the fentanyl to help avoid any severe WD. Im suprised he isnt doing this in the first place. Thats assuming they've been prescribed.


The hydrocodone and oxycodone can help, but you should be careful to take a low dose everyday to avoid WD from them.

Thanks guys, 


I had been prescribed the patches.  There was a miscue between the prescription written, and the 'plan' to get off the patches.  The prescription was short 5 patches, and I did not realize it till too late.  I'm in day 2 of no patches, and feeling pretty squeeby.  I haven't been able to sleep a whole lot, and every inch of my body aches and feels like I am being poked with needles.  Other than that, I am GREAT!  The oxy provides some relief, thank god...Those damn patches--I am steering clear of them from now on...


Thanks, 


JT

Where is the best place to wear the patch? I have heard placement can determine how long it lasts depending on how much fat is in the area.


I know wearing it will not get me high, I'm not trying to get high. Just trying to get the best pain relief for the full 3 days per patch.


I am a skinny person, but not to the point where its unhealthy or I have no fat on my body.


Thanks.

The outside of the upper arm IMO, or on the ouside of the deltoid above the bicep on the outer arm where a short sleeve T-Shirt will cover it. I had problems with the patch sticking in most other areas. You need to pick an area where the skin doesnt move or stretch. it can be a pain in the ass, and no spot is perfect. Some patches are said to stick very well though.


it may also be a bit tough to get a full 3 days out of it. I remember the patch seemed to stay near its best for only about 48 hours. Also it may take until you start wearing the second patch to truly get some relief. Some will even say it takes longer, until a stable amount is in your blood or whatever. Of course it may not help your pain at all, it just depends, I didnt get much help from fentanyl.


Good luck.

the best place to wear the patch is on the head of your johnson. it's a mucous membrane, your dick head that is, not the patch, and that provides better transfer of the fent into you.


it's difficult getting the patch to stay but roll it in a tube with your dick inside and use some tape to hold it all. 


added bonus is the patch is in a consistently (usually) warm place, in your pants

Thanks nikolai. Can I put duct tape over the patch to hold it in place? Or will that make it not work?


I just don't want the damn thing to come off and then become covered in dead skin so that I can't put it back on, then I will have to eat the gel like what happened last time...

You can put tape over the edges of the patch to help hold it in place. Putting tape over the center of the patch holding the gel is supposed to be dangerous because the heat or tightness can cause a quicker release of the gel into the skin leading to potential overdose. 


I know about the dead skin, once on they cannot be removed otherwise it is impossible to get them to stick again. I know wearing the patch can be a pain in the ass. Unfortunately experience is what will help best in figuring those things out, and your doctor doesnt give you 5 extra patchs to cover the 5 that fall off when you start.

**my recemt experiences w/ fentanyl**


I've recently started experimenting with fentanyl. I had had it sporadically in the past and remembered it as an alright narcotic-- particularly nice because of the duration that it could keep w/d at bay-- but not that great for recreational purposes.


This past week, oxies and roxies have been in short supply and fent has be the dope de jur. I'm still underwhelmed and I've found that the stories of its scary potency to be somewhat over-exaggerated. For the opiate naive, the warnings are certainly necessary, sure. But from what i've been reading, the conversion chart that is floating around this site, and my own personal experience, its not really that deadly strong when taken sublinguilly/transbuscally/worn as directed. 


IIRC, the dosing equivalency for someone booting 120mg of oxy a day would be a 75mcg/hr patch worn as directed for the same analgesic relief (but I do realize that analgesia vs euphoria is an argument unto its own). 


I even vaped a bit of the gel one night and didn't find it to be all that intense. A friend and I split a 25mcg/hr patch over the course of a few hours and while we both got high, it was nothing at all like I'd expected (this was my first exposure to fentanyl this year and my first time to ever freebase it). My friend seemed to get quite the high from the same amount of fent; she was actually cautioning me to slow down bc she was quite high and assumed that I must have been too. (FWIW, I did heed her advice and waited twenty minutes or so, but my initial feeling was correct, I was not getting high).


I freely admit that my freebasing technique is not the best and this probably contributed to my lack of "wow" on the experience. Pupils constricted and the w/d symptoms abated so it did work, it just lacked any real euphoria. I also am willing to note that this possibly jacked my tolerance (but subsequent shots of IV oxycodone seem to discredit that theory).


In the interest of harm reduction, I understand why such dire warnings preceed so many fent posts, but for the moderate to deeply addicted opiophile, isn't it just another powerful narcotic? so long as its not being IV'd in essentially unknown quantities, is it really any more dangerous than oxymorphone, hydromorphone, etc? (yes, I understand that it is an order of magnitude more powerful on a mcg per mcg basis, but thats why fent is sold in preparations on the mcg level and opana/dilaudid/oxycodone/morphine in preparations at the mg level) 


I have been slamming anywhere from 80-240mg of oxycodone daily (well, on good days, anyway) for the past several months to catch a good buzz (i took a one week break in april, other than that, i've been doing opiates daily all year). BUT a single 30mg roxi is still enough to knock the sickness off for a few hours. An OC 80 can still be enough to keep me well all day if used 'responsibly' w/ some forethought and restraint. 120-150mgs of oxy in a single shot is enough for me to catch very nice buzz, even get a solid rush sometimes. This is by no means a monsterous habit or dicksizing or whatever, only providing a point of reference.


I did eventually get an alright buzz that first night once I applied a healthy dollop of the gel transbuscally after smoking roughly 1/3 of the 25mcg/hr patch, but it was just sort of heavy and sedating. No real euphoria to speak of at all.


I shot my usual pay-day pick me up of 120mg oxycodone around 2:30pm thursday (which still provided a decent rush and nice high), then I put a 75mcg/hr mylan patch on my upper left bicep thur afternoon at 5pm and, while i have felt no sickness at all today, it never really provided much of a buzz (I understand when wearing the patch it really takes about 12 hours to start getting the full effect, correct?).


In fact, I still "felt" a shot of ~40mg oxycodone around 1pm this afternoon (fri). After 30 hours wearing the original patch, I have titrated my dose by an additional 25mcg/hr patch (worn transdermally on my chest) in the hopes of catching something resembling an opiate high. Roughly three hours later, this seems to be working.


Is this normal? Is fent just not for some people? It is great at providing long-term w/d free work days, but I can't seem to find much recreational value out of it. I would presume that I am totally wrecking my tolerance, except that I still felt a shot of 40mg of oxy whilst wearing a 75mcg/hr patch. Not a huge rush or anything of that nature, but I felt the oxy taste and buzz and my pupils even constricted a tad (another weird thing, my pupils have not been pinned by any stretch today, prior to the shot of oxy. Smaller than normal, yes, but nothing that would indicate even a moderate opiate high).


Am I doing something wrong? I've use both the gel and matrix patches this week, smoked them, worn them, stuck them to my cheek/gums... thoughts?

I just had a patch fall off of my chest. It seems to be sticking fine after re-applying it (it had been there for about 3 hours only). Should it be functioning, even if not at optimal rates? Or is it fucked/should I just start chewing it/doing the transbucal thing?


Thanks...


Shit, the most recent 25mcg patch that I put on my upper chest (even shaved a little spot for it) fell off! I have re-applied it and it seems to be sticking alright, but I believe I read that once a transdermal patch comes off the "pores" if you will are blocked and worthless. It is a mylan brand non-gel style. Is it worthless? Should I take it off and chew it?


fuck, fuck, fuckity fuck fuck... any and all help appreciated!

So I obtained 1 50mc patch and wanted to check the best way to use it. I've been taking 100+ mg of ocycontin a day for probably 9 months or so. Is it safe for me to put on the patch? If I want to feel it in the morning shoudl I put it on at night since it takes awhile to work?


How soon after I havethe patch on can I dose suboxone?

Smoking like chasing the dragon with them? And do you mean with the gel patches? I haven't tried it but I thought there'd be quite a bit difference between chasing with one and an IV shot from one.

Also, I only just found out that they do Fent lollipops. It's not something I want to try as I'm really prone to mouth ulcers but if they make lollipops and Buccal tabs, does this mean that Fentanyl is absorbed better through the mouth/gums than when swallowed and absorbed through the GI tract? 

Just wondering if the gel would be better rubbed into gums then or whether it'd have the exact same affect as swallowing?


Again, not actually gunna try it but just curious.

also, if you have the patch on for a few hours, then take it off for a day or so.  will it still work when you put it back on?

The fent patch takes about 10 hours, and honestly I wouldnt expect anything like the feeling you get from oxycodone. It should help the WD, buit with me, no euphoria, not much pain relief.


Do not take the fent patch off if you want to wear it later. It will not stick tightly with the skin after being removed and will be a giant pain in the ass.


I think the 50mcg patch will be safe for you to wear, but to be sure I would look for a fentanyl equivalency chart somewhere. Fent can be very dangerous if misused.

Its been about 12 hours since I put on patch and I'm still having withdrawal symptoms.  No euphoria at all since I put it on. I thought it would at least have no withdrawals. Very disaapointed

I guess my tolerance is higher than I thought.  a 50mcg patch didn't even keep withdrawals from Oxycontin away. I felt pretty shitty all day yesterday, and even into this mornig, after having it on for 24+ hours.

you're obviously using the wrong keywords.  and i'm going to ask *again* to edit your posts instead od making a new post right after it.  it's annoying and not necessary.


give me a moment and i'll pull up some threads.  there;s many peoples opinions on them and they're all going to say as i've pointed out.


they fucking work sublingually.  there's also an extraction method to seperate the gel from the matrix leaving you with pure fentanyl.

depending what size patches determines the amount of fent in them.  it's easy enough to check out the sandoz website to figure the amount in each sized patches.  google is your friend.


and fentanyl is fentanyl, not one patch is going to be "stronger" than the next.  the larger patches just contain larger contents of the active drug.  the larger patches deliver more fentanyl per hour, which is what i think you mean by stronger.

well i know since Durogesic switched to Matrix, they added 6MG of Fent to their patches to make sure patients were getting pain relief.  Was wondering if Sandoz did that.  On Durgoesic box it says Fentanyl Content: 16.8MG as opposed to the normal 10MG. Mine are 100MCG

**Fentanyl Gel Patches 50mcg/h----are they working?**


Hi there, 


I just received some 50 mcg/h fentanyl gel patches, and although I've tried a lot of different searches, I haven't found the answers to a couple of questions of mine. 


1. I think I have a high tolerance, I was on 120mg of Oxcontin prior to being prescribed these patches a day ago. I put the patch on about 25 hours ago---why am I not feeling anything? Is my dose too low? My doctor said that we could go up to 75 mcg/h if I feel the dose is too low after trying two patches....what should I be feeling to know whether or not it's working? 


2. These gel reservoirs---people have discussed smoking the gel or rubbing it in their mouths, but I'm wondering what happens if you open the reservoir, and only take a little bit out---does the rest of the gel dry up and become unusable, or is there a way to save it?


3. Is it possible that the fentanyl simply isn't in my system yet and that's why I'm not feeling it? I discussed with two doctors how long it would take to get in my system, one said a day and the other three days--so, since it has been one day and I'm not feeling anything, is it possible that I will in the days to come, or is it just that I will probably not feel anything at all? 


I hope those questions were straightforward enough. Basically, I'm using them for chronic pain management but am frustrated as to whether or not they're going to work. Any help on this would be appreciated. 


Thank you!

i had the same problem at first. But you will learn to love your fent. Promise. lol don't do any oxy for a few days (if you have some that is) and you'll be able to feel it once the oxy isn't in your system any more. That's my experience. 


Once you open it you need to put it in a sealed container to keep it from losing its potency, which happens FAST if you aren't careful with it.


I don't think you should do that with gel patches though. I had the gel ones at first, and I prefer the other ones cause you know what your getting when you cut a piece of the patch off. I tried everything with them, and what I've found is that you may get a blob that has no fent in it, and you may get a blob with the entire patch's fent in it. Its not evenly distributed through the gel, which is why people keep dying from them. gel patches. 


so whatever you do, please do so with caution. good luck, and remember, once the oxy is out you'll be able to feel the fent, well at least that's what happened with me.

Thank you, that's very helpful---I've been taking oxycodone for the breakthrough pain to help transition me from the oxycontin---do I need to stop taking that too in order to feel the fentanyl? I'm not taking 120mg of it, more like 30-50mg. 


What does the fentanyl feel lik, if you don't mind me asking? Is it akin to the feeling you get from oxy, or is it different? I just worry that maybe I'm not wearing it correctly or something and want to know what to look for. 


Thanks for the reply, and anymore help you can give!

A Fentanyl high is way better than an oxy high. Due to your oxy tolerance you most likely won't get a good buzz by wearing the patch. Just cut the patch in strips, put them under your tongue/chew them, and work your way up to where you want to be. 


I prefer smoking them though. Just cut off a small portion on the corner of the patch and squeeze some gel out on your foil/pipe (start off small). Once you're ready to preserve it, just tape it back in the pack.

Be careful though, alot of people have OD'd from smoking just a small blob, but all of that really depends on the persons tolerance and overall body. ( I'm 5'11/145 lbs with a daily lortab tolerance, and i can smoke numerous blobs back to back without a problem =/)

To your 2nd post, a chewing high is like a stimulated but nodding/very relaxing feeling to me, and it lasts long


Smoking it (if you do it right), gives a euphoric head rush followed by an intense nod.

Thank you for that info---do you think if I go up to the 75mcg/h patch I'll get a buzz? What about the 100mcg/hr? My doctor isn't sure how to dose me yet. 


You're supposed to cut the gel into strips? Won't the gel ooze out?

don't cut the gel ones into strips. This should only be done with the flat mylan gel-less strips. There's nothing better than a three-day vacation on a 100mcg patch or cutting the mylans and placing a 25mcg strip between your cheek and gum. Fent is my favorite drug period. Your dose might not be high enough for recreational usage, however I do advise against titrating your dose before contacting a doctor. I realize you have a tolerance, but fentanyl is VERY strong and can kill you with little warning if you're not careful. Fent can be subtle at first, but you'll know when it's wearing off.

your pain should be dissipating?  don't expect to get high on a dose that stabilises you, it doesn't work like that.  it sounds like you're treading in uncharted waters - be extremely careful - fentanyl isn't a drug that should be picked up with little to no knowledge, slapping a few patches on to get high.  that's how people die of overdosing.  i'm sure you read those kind of posts when you searched right?


> 2. These gel reservoirs---people have discussed smoking the gel or rubbing it in their mouths, but I'm wondering what happens if you open the reservoir, and only take a little bit out---does the rest of the gel dry up and become unusable, or is there a way to save it?

if the patch is left cut open out in the air then yes it's going to dry up after a period of time.  you can counter act it to some degree by storing it in the fridge (wrapped) in something air tight.

well the fentanyl starts entering your system straight away through your skin (transdermally) though generally takes anywhere between 12-24 hours to reach peak plasma levels.  again, if you're taking them for pain you shouldn't be high.


i'll save you the lecture but tread carefully please.  you're only going to blow your tolerance through the roof abusing fentanyl.

is your pain subsiding or are you just chasing a high?  i'm confused.  you haven't mentioned if your pain level is manageable yet you're alluding to, imo, getting high from the fentanyl.

I thought I replied to this, but it looks like I haven't, so I'll re-type the gist of what I was saying: 


I'm not chasing a high, and do not want to abuse this drug because it seems very scary. I want to know if it's working correctly, or if I need to go up to the next level. My doctor is leaving the decision up to me, but as I am inexperienced with this I'm not sure whether I'm getting enough of the drug or not. I'm still having pain, so I'm still taking oxycodone on top of it---this is where it gets confusing....


I know the oxycodone is working when I get a pleasant little buzz and the pain subsides. I'm not getting any buzz with this 50mcg/h patch and I have now had it on for 48 hours. I'm still having pain. 


My doctor told me it would take an entire patch to reach blood levels that would be equivalent to the 120mg of oxycontin I was taking, and then to wait a second patch to see if it worked to relieve my pain. I'm anxious because I have felt no effects that I can distinguish whatsoever, and am wondering if I should move up to the 75mcg/hr more quickly than I had planned....my doctor doesn't usually subsrcibe narcotics, so she doesn't really know how to dose this or how to transition me from the oxycontin to the fentanyl, which is why I'm looking for help here. 


I use the high as a baseline, I guess, for understanding that my drugs are working. Sure, it's a nice feeling---but it's not what I'm doing this for. I just want to know it's working. Maybe I have it on wrong. 


Could it be possible that I won't feel anything until my second patch, when my doctor assumes my blood levels will be normal? Or is it more likely that I will not be getting any sort of feeling or release from this dose? 


I would love some advice on whether or not to skip the second patch of the 50mcg/h and go straight to the 75mcg/h to manage my pain. I'm not looking forward to another three days of breakthrough pain. 


Is it possible that this drug is working without giving me a high, but that it's simply not a high enough dose to do either (work or get me high)? 


Sorry if this is unclear, I obviously don't know what I'm talking about in regard to these patches. 


Thanks for any help!

i'm assuming the dose you're using isn't enough.  are you using a 12mcg/hr patch or 25mcg/hr patch at the moment?  i wouldn't advise jumping from a low dose straight up to 75mcg/hr, that's how OD's happen.  also follow your doctors instructions, only increasing your dose when they give you the go ahead.

of course it's possible and the fentanyl will be coursing through your body, from the way you've described things the dose isn't high enough to control your pain.  as i said you shouldn't be high 24/7 when you're on PM.

I'm taking 50mcg/h currently.  I know I won't be high 24/7, that would not be fun, but wouldn't there be an initial buzz feeling that would gradually subside if the drug was working?

**Fentanyl**


Possibly a stupid question but in the patches I have which I believe are mylan brand they have a stick substance then a shiny silver layer and on the back say 100mcg/hr fentanyl. Is the fentanyl stored in the sticky goo or in/on the silver layer? Say if I were to smoke or attempt to extract the opiate would I use the sticky which I know contains some if not all of the fentanyl or does the silver lining contain it?Thanks and yes I've googles/searched found contradicting statements.

I'm not that familiar with the patches but I'm pretty sure you have a matrix formulation where the drug is suspended in the silver layer and permeates out through the sticky layer.  I think the only other type has a gel reservoir which you didn't describe.  What is the brand and preparation name of what you have?

What  brand are they?  You aren't giving very much information.. But based on what you described earlier it seems to be the matrix formulation, like amapola said.  The fentanyl is suspended in the patch and relased through the layer into your skin.  The other type of patch has a gel reservoir, which you can then cut open and extract the goo that contains the fentanyl.


Your patches cannot be used like that.  With some chemistry knowledge you could extract the fent most likely, but can be dangerous.  Alternatively you could cut them into strips and dose them buccaly.

I was very cautious my first time using fentanyl, however after using a patch to learn how it affected me and titrating my dose it was awesome.


I had two of the old gel duragesic 100ug/h patches, and the second patch gave me about a day or day and a half of being fucked up via smoking. The day I tested I used blobs no larger than a match head and found out how much I could safely take. I'll use around 80-160mg of OC a day.


Be safe and have fun!


Also, be sure to hold the lighter well below and let it heat up without sizzling; technique is key and it shouldn't leave a black mark on the foil!

Hi someonsable,


Since fentanyl has a short duration of action 48h is more than enough time for levels of the drug to have stabilized in your system.  


I attached a chart I stole from somewhere on the web a while back that has a conversion ratio.  Although fentanyl is considered 10 times stronger than oxycodone switching between the meds is more difficult than just saying you're taking .5mg of oxycodone per hour because of the different method of administration.


The chart places your dosage between the 75 and 100 micrograms per hour preparations.  As it seems the 50mcg/h is still leaving you in constant pain I would try stepping up to the 75mcg/h dose.  To minimize tolerance build up you're looking for a dosage which eliminates constant pain, but you still have some other instant release opiate to deal with breakthrough so you aren't ever over medicating.


Good luck and if you have any other questions just ask.  Perhaps you could get your doctor to refer you to a pain specialist as well as really these questions should be posed to a doctor who knows what they are talking about.

About all it did was make her itch. As we're not familiar with fentanyl and what to expect from it, we'd like to ask before she takes more should the effect be similarish to heroin? I mean, do you know if the dose is correct if coming up on this thing feels the same as with heroin?

I used to get these, and the silver layer is foil/ thin metallic material and the sticky layer is pretty thick 

I'd cut it up into small sections, and chew it until the foil separated, then throw it away, and gum the sticky plasticy gelly like layer which contains the fent

I get prescribed about mg of oxy /dayand a 50mcg patch with gel. I have noticed that if i dont take anything and eat the ge, then chew on the patch, I start flying, talking like a maniac, sweating and doing chores. I have never smoked anything that shouldnt be, and refuse use of needles, so its either eat them, snort them,or just wear the patch. i think eating is the safest way sice you can throw it up, otherwise you just gotta ride it out, and if you took too much, it is one hell of a ride. Good luck!

SWIM was given a 50mcg/h patch that says ratio-fentanyl.  He think its a 'matrix' one, not a gel one as it's paper thin.  He's wondering what the SAFEST way to have some fun with it would be?

He takes 35mg of methadone daily, and uses heroin once a week so he isn't exactly 'opiate-naive'.  He IV's as well....hmmm.....

I've had both the Mylan matrix style and the Watson gel patches. I am at 150µg and it still isn't cutting my pain. The first day is about 30% relief, but the oddest thing is that I get random 'chubbies' throughout the day subsiding the second day. I haven't been able to get to that calm state or nod. It just acts like a stimulant rather than put me out cuz I can go up to 36 hrs before getting tired.


I have thought about trying the extraction on the mylans(see [POST #1](http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/showpost.php?p=8130709&postcount=1)), but this time I got the gels. I change them @ 48 hrs so ideally I should still have 50µg left. Waste not, want not, so needless to say, I have  been putting a pinch between my cheek and gum after changing patches. That has helped with the pain, but again, no 'wheeee'. I think I am just too far tolerant to ever get there and if I tried I would probably OD.![8o](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/eek.gif)

Hello everyone, someone just purchased two 100mcg patches and one 25mcg. Someone got them from someone who wears for one day then sells them. Problem is someone wanted to wear them and now can't. The drug inside the patch has hardend and the stickiness is gone. How can someone get the most out of these? Someone already scraped a 100 with a razor and now have a pile of what looks like little plastic film shards which is def fent but have no experience with these other than wearing. What should someone do next with this pile and with the next 2 patches?  Someone is heroin addict with tolerance of about 6 bags in 24 hours insuffalated. Doseage help please? Administration help please? Please help asap as someone is sick and wants not to od. They look generic as there's only the strength written on it unlike the previous cell like filled patches someone had and worn before. Can someone please give someone some help with this. I,d love you forever, thanks

While you're right to be wary of guess-dosing something like fentanyl, your best bet would probably to try and place those little flakes in between your cheek/gums or under the tongue and hold it as long as you can without swallowing.

Thank you its working well comes on real strong peaks then drops fast. I seperated it into 4 piles or doses out of a 100 patch so I'll probably just eat the whole 25mcg. Thanks again theres probably a way to turn it to powder just haven't googled yet

MY buddy's got a 25 mcg/h SANDOZ matrix fent patch, which contains 5,78 mg fentanyl which he's planning to use buccaly. He asked me these questions:

-since he has quite high tolerance to tramadol/benzos/alcohol, how much would it be okay to take? ( to be exact, he can consume 500mg tramadol+5mg xanax+3-4 beers, without even being that high)

1/8 of the patch contains 722,5 mcg Fentanyl

or

1/16, which would mean 361,25mcg.


What he is looking for is to moderately feel the drug.


As far as im concerned they make 400mcg lollipops, so the 361mcg piece might not even be enough according to his tolearnce?


You'd help hell of a lot guys, please

The only reason im askig it, because i found a lots of warnings about how important tolerance to other opiates is, but you guys mostly compare it to oxys, which i have no access to. So my question is if tramadol tolerance should also be considered before trying to "fuck around" fent?

**Yeah, fent..**


I think that 1/16 or 1/8 are very small pieces and he won't take smthg. (that's just my opinion, i wish he get something from such a small piece). But yeah, as a matter of fact is better and safe to start slow, and if he doesn't feel anything, he can cut bigger pieces (not too much though..). Yeah, with fent is always better to start slow, and then maybe he can adjust his dose..And he have to be patience, not in 3-5 min "oh,it didn't make anything, let's get a bigger piece..". Stay cool and give the fent the time it needs to work out..Be safe and high,mate...![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

You should update the first page. When you keep referring to buccal, you are really referring to Actiq (generic: Oral Transmucosal Fentanyl Citrate). With the new buccal and sublingual products on the market, e.g., Onsolis, Fentora, Abstral, people should know that the BA differs in all of them and they should be aware of the BA and other effects of each, and not assume because Fentora is buccal and so is OTFC, that it is the same.


I would be happy to write up the differences. LMK

**polydrugaddiction and fentanyl concerns**


Ok let me break this down as simply as possible. I've been up for two days on heavy amounts of amphetamine salts and i am withdrawing fairly moderately off bupe. In the part I've had a heavy heroin habit which i licked via sub clinic. Every time i would try to do bags the sunshine would block them even as fast ad two or three days out

 I was kicked off my clinic because i couldn't afford my bills. So i went to rehab and got clean, however the post acute was enough to drive me crazy. My girlfriend gets two sub 8mg strips daily, and out of mercy she has been giving me enough to take about two mg a day.  I went three days without any because all i had left was about a one mg shred. A little over 24 hours ago i took that last little piece.  Now i find myself sick again so i traded many remaining amph for two sib strips and a 100 mcg generic duragesic will be arriving momentarily (watson). Now this brings me to the confusing questions. I don't know hardly anything about fent because it's hard to get on Pittsburgh, well the patches any ways. Our heroin stamp bags have fent in them. Basically i want to know what method would suit me best to get the highest based on the following conditions:

I don't know what effect that small amount of bupe i took yesterday is going to do to block. The rest of my concerns are based on drug interactions, potentiations

My body is chalk full of amphetamine. I just took 60mg temazepa and 1mg clonazepam to take the edge of the speed. Stop based on that and the following meds i have, can someone tell me the best roa so i get a nice warm high and don't waste such a rare opiod. Also please tell me which of these meds i should take to potentiate the high, and which i should avoid for whatever reason:

I have 1mg alprazolam, about 40mg clonazepam and 30 30mg temazepams.i have a ton of gabapemtin, a ton of hydroxyzine hcl, about four more thirty mg adderall irs, loads of mirtazapine, magnesium oxide, and 16mg buperenorphine.

Now after we figure out the most efficient roa can you please help me to know which of my medicines will increase my fent higj, which will decrease it, and which will cause a fatal reaction.

Thank you so much

**complex polydrug fentanyl buprenorphine questions**


Ok this might be a little complicated but i only very rarely get this chance so please help. I have been taking about six mg of suboxone daily. Tomorrow i am getting a 100mcg/hr Watson fentanyl patch. I just took 4mg bupe sublingually and i am getting my patch 15 hours from now. How long will i have to wait until i could get high off my patch and which roa should i use to get as high as possible. When i get opiods, i generally can't hold them long before using. I have no self control so please don't lecture me in that regard. Should i just put it on and by time it kicks in maybe the sub would have worn off? Or will maybe smoking it be enough to overcome the buprenorphine? I think you guys could see where i am going with this. Last month i was 24 hours off sub before i got a 100 patch and smoked the whole thing a bb at a time on foil and did not od. Omg though i can't think of any craving stronger than thinking about a lung full of fent smoke. Ya it wears off quick like stamp bags but if you pay attention that is just the initial rush. A lot of times, however, the nod creeps on you and can last for a few hours. I never wore a patch, will it keep me really high? I don't know if it is down regulated opiate receptors but it has always taken a lot for me to get slammed. Also i will have scripts for gabapentin, temazepam, clonazepam, and adderall 30mg ir. Any of these combo for a nice synergy. Oh ya hydroxyzine hcl as well. After this post i am going to post an opiod conversion android app as a thanks you for your help

I believe you taking a 100mcg/hour fentanyl patch would kill you. You do not have a high enough tolerance to even consider fentanyl, let alone the 100mcg/hour patch, especially when you lack complete self control. 


That sir, is a suicide mission. Abort, or Houston we'll have a problem.

Wait what are you talking about? I've been using heroin for over a Decade and suboxone on and off for years which is underestimated on its own. It sky rockets your tolerance, plus is a partial agonist. And last month when i was in suboxone withdrawal, i smoked an entire 100mcg/hr fentanyl patch while on 150mgs of temazepam and I'm still here.

smoking has instant onset, easier to gauge your high. With transdermal, you don't know until it's too late.

So far i smoke half the gel out of a 100mcg/hr Watson gel fentanyl patch, ate 60mg adderall ir , took 4mg clonazepam, 90mg temazepam, and 50mg hydroxyzine hcl. Holy hell i feel amazing. Pure euphoria. Only problem is slight angina, other than that i feel like I'm in heaven. Is there anything i can do with the remaining half to add to the length of my high? Is it not possible to wear once cut open? And since its cut open do i have to do it all now so it doesn't go bad? What should i do? I want my high to last as long as possible. The adderall seems to be potentiating it.  Is thisa dangerous combo? I'm really enjoying the itch too

Tricromb it seems like you really don't like me, man

 I was just giving my current experience and looking for input on what would be the next best move. Dwelling on things i already did wasn't going to help anything. I appreciate it, if it was out of concern, and not just an attempt to make me feel like scum,

Well anyways i took my last few blobs out of the 100mcg/hr patch last night and surprisingly was nodding off for hours on end. However this morning the fentanyl started to quickly wear off, about the same time my amphetamine crash started. Craving hard for even a tiny hit of fentanyl, i knew i had to do something. The only opiod i had on me was suboxone and to avoid talking it out of my intense op opiod craving, i decided to distract myself by talking more amphetamine. Suprisingly it helped mask the fentanyl cravings. However hours have passed and I'm really starting to feel the need for something to bind to my muopiod receptors. Basically my question is, how long after the last dab of fentanyl touched my tongue, do i have to wait to take some sublingual suboxone? I really hope i can do it soon, i will feel so much relief once i successfully get the bupe back into my system. As long as i can avoid a severe withdrawal precipitation, I'm golden. Buprenorphine is like a security blanket to me. It had such a strong receptor affinity, and a long half live. Although it doesn't cause much euphoria or respiratory depression, does not mean it isn't a highly potent opiod. Have you ever seen and opiod naiive take approx 4mg bsuboxone? It is not a pretty site. Anyone who had some solid knowledge on how long i have to wait after fent to take bupe? Please avoid speculation, answers based on fact and experience are really going to help me immensely. I'm really uncomfortable right now, and i am setting aside my pride to get some help.

Thanks bluelight  love you guys

Hey guys, I'm just looking for some experienced advice. 8 years ago, at 11 years of age, I had a severe back spasm that in turn caused me not to be able to walk for 2 days. I've been in several car accidents. I've been to the chiropractor and X-rays showed that my back was dissilined. I am only 19 years old, I have had to self dose myself for the last year or 2. At first it was to get "fucked up" now it's to manage my pain. M first experience with a fentanyl patch, I did a 50/mcg. The whole thing, I've had to chew up pieces cause I just dont think it's working. It's been about 35 hours since first application. How should I go about consulting a doctor? Proving to them I have constant chronic back pain, without them assuming I want to get "fucked up". Need advice please!

I realize this thread is a bit old....fentanyl/duragesic/etc patches can be soaked in hot water on the tail end.  I don't care what your tolerance is, you're playing with fire trying suck out a full patch.  Several deaths from hardcore heroin users who decided to try that.

Strange... I seem to remember telling somebody that smoking it would be best because it sounded like he was going to regardless of the warnings. I remember telling him to start with literally the smallest piece he could and work his way up and you replied:  " "The best way I've found to do fentanyl is smoking it". Harm reduction it's finest. *facepalm*." 


Idk, I'm just under the impression that if someone's going to do it regardless of warnings, they should probably get a little information besides the standard "if you do it you'll probably die" comments. They just don't seem to make a difference is what I mean. Also, treating me like I'm stupid in like half the posts about fentanyl, even when I explain that it's incredibly dangerous and shouldn't be abused, but if they're going to anyway here's a bit of info, gets a little annoying.

I believe fentanyl patch strenghts 12 micrograms / hour and 25 micrograms / hour are the only patches that can be prescribed to a non-tolerant individual. Anything above that: opioid tolerance is required.

Huh, are you sure about that? People on this site keeps saying you can't get it without a tolerance. I don't know that for sure I'm always messing with the 75 or 100 duragesics. I'm just wondering if you're positive on that.

i use 3-MF 3-MethylFentanyl, its a brown powder, You can smoke it on foil or IV it for quite a rush. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

its dangerous though, like very good quality heroin would be so always start slow even with a tolerance. you never know ![;)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f609.png)

fwiw it states on the jannsen cilag site, as well as in the information booklet you receive inside the box of patches, that a non-tolerant patient should be started on no more than 25mcg/hr patches - a tolerance equivalent to 40mg of oxy for no less than a couple of weeks if i recall right.  it's been posted before.

Fentanyl is an amazing pain killer and it's extremely high transdermal BA is a plus, too bad the delivery systems are so flimsy. Very glad about mostly matrix patches dominating the market now.

Judging only from what I've seen, a lot of people I knew doing it gave up and likely returned their focus to heroin, in a small way, this feels like an improvement. Of course, there are some who are desperate enough to continue to abuse the matrix patches. I cringe everytime I hear people talking about melting down and vaporizing the patches and I ask them what kind of patches they get. They usually say Mylan, I usually cringe.


 The matrix patches are great for transdermal delivery though, great analgesia, and I really hope that I won't be forced on the patch for many years to come. I'll probably bark up the morphine tree for until I'm too delusional to resist doctors anymore. Like I was saying, if you can keep the damn thing attached to your skin and work out the perfect time to replace a patch, **as directed by your doctor **although this is usually accomplished via stacking or BT meds.

Can I ask if you know of any specific reasons that smoking the adhesive is worse for you than smoking the blue gel? I've noticed the adhesive seems much less harsh l, and you smoke much smaller amounts. I'm not sure what's in that blue gel, but you definitely have to smoke a lot more of it. By the way, I don't smoke the hard plastic on top. I either transfer the adhesive onto foil with heat, or I scrape it off with a hot razor blade. Actually I've started smoking it off glass.

hey, this is kind of a vague question but.. for someone who gets a pretty decent buzz off say 40mg oxynorm ir snorted plus a few bars (although could easily go as high as 60mg or 80mg - i mean i'm not nodding out on 40mg, just feeling good, and also note that's oxynorm, 40mg of regular oxycontin is a pretty average buzz for me), how long could i make a 25mcg patch last me? 


believe it or not fentanyl was the first opiate i ever tried and a 100mcg patch at that. me and my friend cut off tiny strips and rubbed them on our gums and once it set in it was one of the best highs of my life. i've had morphine and fentanyl in hospital as well and doctors are always pointing out how much it takes to put me under (had a shoulder that constantly dislocated, long story). point is i do have an opiate tolerance, although it's not from huge daily usage.


if i did happen to come across a 25mcg patch, could i do the same thing and cut it up into small strips and rub it on my gums? it's so hard to figure out what the equivalent dosage of doing that would be to oxycodone. the reason i ask is that these things cost a pretty penny as i'm sure everyone knows and i'd like to be able to get my moneys worth.


edit: just found the chart a few pages back. so an entire 25mcg patch is only worth 20-70mg of oxycodone? that doesn't seem like much at all? what's all this talk about how dangerous it is?

yeah, you can certainly cut it into strips again.  i'd cut it into quarters and start with one.  let it sit on your cheek for 15-20mins to establish effects.  if it starts to get heavy then take the adhesive out immediately.

but so will a quarter of a 25mcg patch be a similar high to 40mg oxynorm snorted or stronger. because obviously i'd be paying more than i'd pay for oxy, but i can't get my hands on any at the moment and i also would like to try fentanyl again because i fucking loved it the first time i tried it. back then i did way less than a quarter of the 100mcg patch though, i cut a strip off the size of like a suboxone film. my opiate tolerance back then was zero though.


it's really hard to figure this out.

ok, so but this is for a daily dosage, which i'm assuming means this is how much you would take if you were accustomed to taking 30-67mg of oxycodone spread out throughout a day instead of in a single dose, because the idea is that the fentanyl is going to be released slowly. so i guess i have to consider my method of administration? if i'm rubbing 1/4th of a 25mcg patch on my gums, that's 6.25mcg being released relatively instantaneous, which is only 0.006mg of fentanyl, which is hardly anything right? i'm so confused.


basically i'm just saying that if i'm dropping almost double what i'd be paying for oxy, i'd want to be able to have twice as much, as in if 80mg lasts me two days of fun, then i'd want paying a 25mcg patch to last me roughly three to four days of fun.


i know that any second now someone's going to pop in and say "if you can't figure it out then you shouldn't bother". 


argh this is so frustrating! dying for help here.


edit: now i'm getting somewhere! a 25mcg fentanyl patch contains 2.5mg of fentanyl which is the equivalent of 500mg of oxycodone which is obviously a lot. so i think it's safe to say if i cut off a quarter and rubbed it on my gums or smoked it, i would be sufficiently fucked up.


not sure if this helps anyone else, but there we go.

I have been taking taking methadone for a lite over a week straight. I started at 30mg & gradually went to 60mg, which my last dose of this was yesterday morning at about 9am. I have not done any other opiates but I'm still not comfortable. I came across an 100mcg fentanyl patch. I used to either do these bucally or rectally. ( they're the gel ones ) if I were to use the patch bucally or rectally 24hrs after my last dose of methadone would it have any effect? Would it get me high at all? I know these two drugs can be potentially dangerous, and I have read things saying that. But does anyone have an actual experience to this, that could give me some insight on whether the gel from the patch would give me a high, using a bucal or rectal ROA?     I would be doing this today, so any responses will be greatly appreciated. Thank you && happy thanksgiving ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

I have a 50mcg duragesic for pain control and recently all the pharmacies in my area switched from smallish rectangle patches with a harder plastic back that was split down the middle (think it was Watson) to some awful new brand that's long and rounded at the edges made by Actavis, and the new kind suck. The adhesive wears off quickly, the patch releases too much too soon and then wears out too fast so by the middle of day 2 in a 3 day cycle I'm getting breakthrough pain and by the next morning am a wreck. Also, the freaking things are giving me skin lesions all around the edges. So I have a couple questions: is there anything can do except plaster other tape over the things like the world's worst holiday present to try to keep them on better, and is this happening to anyone else, especially the sores part? Also, what if anything is the best waay to try to squeeze the last drops out of these for a quicker hit right before go to bed on the last night to try to knock self out till the next day when can change the patch (I have a high tolerance, been on patch for years now along with percs which take anywhere from 45mg-60mg/day). All I know is that I want to find whoever designed these Actavis patches and make them eat a roll of duct tape

Just a quick question. I'm pretty sure I know the answer already but I'm kind of in a fuck-it mood. I've got a Duragesic 50mcg. Right now I'm on .5mg klonopin that I'm rx'd. Truthfully I haven't done opiates in a while though I used to bang H quite heavily. Like in the last two months all I've done is bang a OC 40 and drank a bottle of Hydromet. Long story short does anyone think it's possible for me to take even the smallest amount possible bucally or orally and be alright or is that pretty much a death wish? I'm not trying to OD I just feel like mental ass right now.

Alright so I've acquired a generic brand transdermal patch 25 ug / hour for 72 hours. Since the patch has 2.5 mg of fentanyl dispersed evenly, I'm thinking of cutting it into 9 pieces so that I each piece will have about 278 ug. After reading through various websites (including this one) that should be equivalent (sublingually) to about 20 mg of oxycodone. Can someone confirm this? 


Also, would this be a good dose for someone with zero tolerance? I used to take 20 mg of oxycodone with zero tolerance and had no problems.

I would recommend 500ug or so sublingually since the BA is 50%.

So, I came across a few boxes of expired duragesic 50ug transdermal patches (the gel ones). After doing a lot of research, I decided to go ahead and give them ago. I haven't worn them, only because when I initially open the package, there is visible gel leaked out of the patch. I know that this has accounted for several fatal OD's, and I understand that once you wear a patch it takes awhile to work/get out of your system.


My tolerance is between 60-110 mg oral oxycodone daily for about 5 months, but have been using for over a year. 


So I decided to start sublingual/buccal administration. At first, I put a tiny dot onto a q tip and rubbed it on my gums. nothing. I did this a few more times, and felt a slight buzz, but nothing pronounced. The next day, I cut the strips up and put them under my tougne and let the gel ooze out. I did this with out swallowing for around 20 min- 1 hour and got noticible effects, but nothing compared to oxy. I don't smoke or inject.


Is there a better way to utilize the gel in the old patches? Also, since they are expired, is it possible that they have lost potency?

Okay, I have a fentanyl nasal spray. It contains 10ml at 1.58mg/ml.

I must have used most of it up because I had to repeatedly depress the nozzle thing to get even a tiny, weak spray out. Stupidly, I unscrewed the top and peered inside. Still I saw either nothing so I (again, very stupidly) decided to put the hole at the top of the little bottle (with the nasal off,the hole was almost too big to fit into a nostril) and tip my head back snorting in what was left.


Well, it was more than I thought! Probably >1ml but no more than 2ml. So I probably got 1.58-3mg fentanyl in one go.


I have a pretty high tolerance to opiates and can take 300mg of OxyContin (even with small doses xanax on top) a day no problem and have often as much as around 120-150mg in a half hour period.


Anyway, the amount of fentanyl I ingested is the equivalent of 79mg to 150mg (I'd say POSSIBLY, though unlikely, an extreme most of 175mg). << Those numbers are the equivalent dose in Oxycodone, by the way, because oxy is my usual drug of choice.

I had taken 30mg ocycodone and 0.5mg xanax prior to this.


It's about 20 minutes later now and while I can feel I am very much under the influence of opiates (slow movements, slow everything, tiredness) I'm only nodding very slightly and it's not hard to keep keep eyes open. I've made more spelling/grammatical errors than usual, I have had the wherewithal to correct them. I have also been able to type this fairly long post rationally and logically.


Any advice would be appreciated.


Will I be okay with my tolerance and the smount of time that has passed

Well Oxy8, i just chill to say you slow the fucking things down, everday you post things you do with the fucking fentanyl, and they're too risky..Be fucking careful please, i don't know you personal, but i can say for sure, if you continue doing these fuckin shady "expirements" with the fent, smth bad will happen..i know that you've got a high tolerance, but don't forget that fent is not oxy. And i don't mean about the potency, but i mean that fent won't gives you signs that the OD is coming, and that's why a lot of people fuckin OD...Stick on the oxy with the xanax, i'm sure it can make you as high as you want, leave the fucking fent out before it's too late..

With concerns...

So, this is a pretty long thread and I wanted to share my experiences and thoughts about using fentanyl patches I.V. even though I'll admit that I haven't read all of the posts and it's possible I'll be dealing out info that already exists here. If so... Well... I suppose this will just reinforce such information... Anyhoo.

For quite a while I was using fentanyl patches on a regular basis. It was the only opiate I found was able to break through even my fairly low dose of daily methadone. Other things would work in higher doses, but fent was definitely the best; and it was cheap by comparison to the other opiates I was able to get my hands on. I had pretty regular access to 100mcg/hr 72 hour patches. Correct me if I'm wrong here, but it seems to me (like, duh) that this makes the total drug in each patch 7.2 mg? These were the clear ones (ratio-fentanyl here in Canada) with no reservoir/gel. 


Before I get into my method of preparation and dose I'll state that at the time I was taking 30mg of methadone daily... to give you an idea of where my tolerance was at the time.


To I.V. I would:


-Remove packaging and plastic backing from the patch and cut it into 4 evenly sized pieces (important to remember that I'm talking about the clear patches with no reservoir/gel!) One of these pieces was generally going to produce the high I was looking for. Obviously the dose I wanted changed from time to time. For an opiate naive I'd say I.V. Fentanyl just isn't for you, but if you must, then maybe take less than half of this dose... Maybe 1/10th of a patch or so.


-Return the backing to 3 of the pieces for use later. Actually, more often I would stick the remaining pieces to the screen of my iPhone (amazing product placement here!); where they would safely remain until their turns were up. Most clean plastic surfaces will do this job just fine.


-sprinkle absorbic acid (vitamin C) onto the sticky side of the piece of patch I'm going to use. I would coat the thing. The vitamin C would help disolve the drug, and as a bonus it would make the little sticky plastic bastard a whole lot easier to handle and get into the cooker. I see others in this thread are using alcohol, and I don't know the pros and cons of that vs. my method. Although, it's probably not a good idea to use your chewable vit c tablets here. Just the ansorbic acid plz! In Canada it's easy to get the appropriate absorbic acid in little orange pouches at any needle exchange/dispenser.


-Once the coated patch was in the cooker I'd add sterile water and then cook it up, letting the water boil for a solid 20 seconds or more. Just had to make sure I started with enough water.


-After boiling it I always used the back end of a spoon or fork to try and gingerly, yet forcefully, scrape the adhesive and drug off the plastic patch in the hot water. Could also use a  spork. The exact tool didn't matter... Just any scrapy thing would do. I would be able to see the goop coming off the plastic and I'd try to get it all off.


-Boil the water for another ten seconds or so.


-Then it'd be pretty standard I.V. practice. Used a filter, sucked up the druggie water, cleaned my injection site with alcohol swab, tied off, inserted needle, flagged to make sure I was in the vein, removed tie, injected, and used a clean piece of cotton or whatever bandage to apply a little pressure, stop it from bleeding, and help prevent scarring.  (Not enough people bother with the last bit, but it helps keep your injection sites healthy. This is at about the time your drug is getting shit done for you though,  so I can understand wanting to just settle into a lovely mouth breathing staring contest with the wall for a few minutes first.)


Things to keep in mind:

As has been mentioned here, fentanyl is a very strong drug, and a small variation in dose makes a big difference. It is to be respected. As always, start small. You can always take more of the drug, but you can't put any back!


To be more accurate with the dose than I am I think it'd probably be even better to cook up the entire patch at once and measure a portion of the liquid end product. I have heard the drug isn't always spread evenly across the patch. I think doing it this way would solve for that possibility, no?


Also, I would think you could use this preparation, but instead of shooting it into your vein you could let the drugged up water hang out in your mouth for a while, or even stick it up yer butt if you felt like it. I don't see any reason these things wouldn't work just fine.


Fentanyl is strong, the high is pretty great, the half life is short, and you can build a tolerance and dependency pretty fast. Definite potential life wrecker extraordinaire. Be careful!


Good luck trying to take a pee. (or whatever other toilet biz I don't want to discuss with you.)

There is a lot of info in this thread about how to use patches, but could someone advise me on the best and safest method of using pure Fentanyl HCI powder? I know many people will advise against its use altogether, which is understandable, but I really need some constructive advise on what to do with Fent in powder form. I am well experienced with a range of opiates/opioids, but have never used this particular one, so really need to know how to go about it in the safest, least harmful manner.

I also posted in the Pain Management thread, but I thought I could ask on this thread too. Please delete if this isn't okay...


I have a quick question for you guys, 


I am currently on 100mcg Fentanyl, for chronic pain (fractured C7, fibromyalgia, chronic migraines, hip dysplasia and endometriosis. Yeah, my body sucks, I know)


It is doing NOTHING. for my pain. Not to mention I've got major withdrawal for some reason. I was moved up from 60mg methadone, which actually worked pretty okay, but I was still in a lot of pain and my doc didn't want to up the done, so he said I should go on Fent instead. It's been over a month now and I STILL have wd's every minute, every day. Plus the pain. 

He says there isn't anything stronger he can give me, but is that really true? I live in Denmark and the following painkillers are the only ones approved here.


Buprenorphine 

Codeine	

Fentanyl

Hydromorphone

Ketobemidon 

Metadone

Morfine Sulfate

Nicomorphin	

Oxycodone	

Pethidin	

Tramadol	


I've tried almost all of them, but I don't know wtf to do now that I apparently have such a megatolerance. I've been discussing Dilaudid with my doctor but he said he's never used that before and will have to consult a colleague. So I don't know what he'll decide. I just wanted to ask if anyone has any suggestions? Do I go cold turkey til I can use a lighter opiate again, or do I continue to fight the system for something stronger. 

What would YOU do? 


Thanks for reading

If anyone could help.... (it's about the patch)


This is a serious question so I am looking for serious answers.


Okay  so I was on 2mg of dilaudid (hydromorphone) 3x a day. And like everyone  who is on painkillers, obviously your tolerance goes up fast,  especially with such fast acting pills. Before I knew it I was taking 5  pills a day, then 6, then taking 2 2mg at a time etc etc. I kept having  to go see my doctor because the pills were no longer working and I was  running out very fast. I went through 60 pills in the course of 8 days,  several times and that was me trying to use them sparingly. But anyway  she put me on fentanyl 25mcg every 72 hours. Obviously that did nothing.  So I went back 2 days later and she gave me 50mcg ever 72 hours. It is 2  patches that are 25cmg. And then some dilaudid for breakthrough pain in  the mean time. So I stuck the 2 patches on and took half a pill and  waited. Now I am not sure if the patch worked or not but I felt fine,  but that could;ve been because of my pills. I ran out again (she only  gave me 28) and I am in ALOT of pain. I just put on 2 fresh patches this  morning and am waiting for them to work.... I feel no relief so far. So  I am wondering, is it safe to chew a little piece of patch while  waiting? And could these maybe not be working because of the brand,  because 25mcg should've been okay, I was only taking 14-16mg of dilaudid  a day. It is the teva ones and it's like a plastic with sticky on it,  not gell.


Help please, I am SO sore!

Hello everyone and curious girly,


Well Well, Unsurprisingly from what i have read about these patch's from other people they are absolutely useless. Im in the same boat as you ive been given the teva patches recently and i find them ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC !  Are yours the matrifen brand or teva generics ? They only contain a stated 11mg of fentanyl on the 100mcg patch's ( I dont think they even contain that myself) and the 25mcg patch's only contain a supposid 2.75mg which is a HUGE amount lower than the durogesic patch's that i am used to 4.2mg on the 25's 12.6mg for the 75's and 16.8mg for the 100 mcg patch's. They almost feel like placebo patch's that have no effect or very little. These are same as you have described non gel patch. I absolutely hate the things and am never having teva / matrifen patch's again. I was only feeling ok when i was using morphine tablets on top so i think teva are being very stingy or shady about the amount of fentanyl they are putting in their patch's as i dont see how they can be this much weaker than the durogesic without shady thing going on. In my country it also appears dr's are being bribed or fooled into prescribing matrifen because they cost a bit less to the nhs. Scrips have changed and no longer say fentanyl now there issued by brand as matrifen. 


My dr said they had been advised by the PCT or nice whoever it is that everyone has to have the same brand to avoid confusion but that seems like utter bullshit to me. Im not saying my dr is lying to me because im sure he wouldnt, i think its the other way around and that teva have said to nhs something along the lines of we will knock around 25% of the cost of the patch's if you only issue our brand.


I think im going to write or email teva and complain about them to see what they say got to say about it. At best their 100mcg patch's are equal to about 62mcg an hour of the durogesic. Also durogesic are physically larger patch's with a bigger surface area which suggests to me they are under dosed. I say everyone should boycott teva and matrifen patch's . Did you change to a different brand curiously girly or are you still on these awful teva patch's idd love to know how your getting on now please feel free to PM me or add me as a friend.     


Peace

Hello guys,

Ive got 1000 x200ug fentanyl blotters for free from my friend who works in pharmacy industry and have enough luck to obtain pure chemicals and therefore he laid blotters himself. I trust him. I understand that fentanyl is super-potent and very dangerous chemical if used irresponsibly, especially for non-tolerant persons, dont get me wrong. I have almost no tolerance to opiates and I dont use them often - 15-20mg of oxycodone does the trick for me, 40mg makes me vomit. What would be safe but still effective dose for me? I thought trying 100 and 200ug other time if Im not satisfied? ROA buccal. Thank you for giving me advice despite the fact you dont agree with me as non-tolerant person trying fentanyl.

^ Why not just start REALLY small, like 10ug? If you've got such a huge amount and obviously you're capable of waiting... You don't have to worry about wasting a little finding a threshold dose, so just start ultra small and work up until you find a good dose.


That said - what is your longer-term game plan? What is your plan if you find yourself consuming it daily? What happens when you run out?


It is really asking for trouble having enough opiates on hand to sustain an addiction for a lengthy period of time..


If you don't take opiates much and wish to keep it away, I'd advise to never have more than a couple days worth on hand at any given point, have a months worth (or whatever) is just asking for a habit.

My plan is to either sell or give most of my stash and do rest of it rarely. I dont think I will instantly fall into addiction because my lifestyle and work doesnt allow me to use drugs often. And, I dont want it. I tried most of availible addictive drugs like coke, heroin, benzos or meth and never had that problem. The reason I intended to take "larger" dose because I take drugs (besides weed) only occasionally and I dont want to "waste" several occassions to find effective dose, that would mean approximatelly half year. Im not type of person, hey free friday now Im going to test fentanyl because I have nothing else to do. No.

Any chances for answer? I used online opioid converter and it says 50ug IV fent -> 100ug SL fent -> 10mg oxycodone, is this right?

Ok, no one has info so - tried 4 doses in 2 days. Short-term tolerance might have played a role.  25ug was treshold, 100-200ug was medium dose, 300-400ug high dose (at least 8h between doses). Duration 2-3 hours, closer to 2.No nausea,no problems. Not as euphoric as lets say oxycodone, but I enjoyed it. I fine 100ug SL fent equipotent to ~7mg oxy.

Another example of how dangerous fentanyl can be, transdermal is the ONLY safe way for those inexperienced (and experienced for that matter) to take the drug and why it has the reputation it does.

Well.  I just want to say to anyone considering trying fentanyl to be very careful.


Especially  in powdered form.  I purchased 100 mg's of fentanyl hcl, and lets just  say, even though I was trying to dose incredibly small, I ended up  almost killing myself.


When people say take small doses of this stuff to start, BELIEVE THEM.  Start small.


I took what i thought would be 25 mcg, i dunno I eye'd it out.  (another note, don't be a moron like me, always use a scale.)


I  woke up and my whole head was throbbing and spinning, my heart was  beating really weird, and everything sounded like i was listening  through multiple sets of earplugs.  Plus lots of tenitus.  I remember my  dad talking to me, trying to tell me a story, and i could understand, i  just remember attempting to be polite and make him leave.  it took him  forever to get the message.  I cant believe he didnt notice how fucked i  was.


anyways, he walked away, i got up closed my door, locked it, went back to my bed and passed out, face up.


Its  weird, as i think about it now, i wonder to myself, if i died on my bed  there.  even for just a few minutes.  I havent felt right since, and im  wondering if maybe i caused significant damage to my brain due to lack  of oxygen.  I dunno.  It feels like I died.


Anyways, eventually,  around 8pm, about 12 hours after my dad was trying to talk to me, i woke  up.  I felt just as bad as before, if not worse.  I was truly scared at  this point.  I believed I was going to die.  My room was littered with  drug paraphenalia, again I cant believe my dad didnt see any of the  stuff when he was talking to me.  I got to wonder if he's getting a  little senile.  I wanted to go to the hospital, but me being me (ie an  idiot) i was too scared to get in trouble with my parents (more so  afraid of shaming them with me doing something so dumb) So i stumbled  around my room, falling over things.  I hid what i could, and put on a  jacket.  My dad was watching tv in the next room, and my mom hadnt  gotten home yet from work.  I sort of stumble ran out the house, got in  the car and started it.  Of course my mom pulls in the driveway as im  walking to the car.  i sort of wave hi to her, acting as if everythings  cool n im just going out.  I get in the car, of course she wants to talk  to me.  Shes all where are you going, its icy out be careful!!  and im  trying to pretend im not dying.  anyways, i drive to the hospital while  od'ing on fentanyl.  possibly the dumbest thing ive ever done.  


By the way I got in legal trouble over that, so thats just icing on the cake.


I  went to the hospital er, waited in line, described what was happening  to me, saw the look on the nurses face go from "what lie are you gonna  tell me to get drugs?" to "oh shit, this kids actually in trouble".  so  they took me in, pumped some really weird drug into me that made me feel  really hot and cold at the same time.  apparently they use it to push  stuff out of the opioid receptors, and block them.  either way it felt  like a eird psychedelic mindfuckerry combined with a really weird  upper.  It was unpleasant.


eventually i went to sleep.  after of  course, i made the idiot move of telling them how i got to the hospital  in the first place.  Fuck I wish I had told them I took a cab.  Now i  have to go in to this rehab clinic thing.  they claim i have a  dependance, even though i only took the drug once, and they also had my  license suspended.  Fuck those pricks.  Seriously, i understand that i  shouldnt have driven, but if i hadnt id probably had died.  I know what i  did was stupid, but its so fucked up how they can punish you for being  honest, where someone who is dishonest would get off scott free.  fuck  our society.  they assume a drug user must be a drug abuser.  they dont  know the difference, yet they claim to have equality and be tolerant.   those are just words to them, they dont truly know the meaning.


Anyways, I'm a tool, I know.


Do as I say not as I do.


Be careful with Fentanyl, it is motherfucking dangerous.


*Edit:  On a side note, it's been a week since it happened, and I still have trouble keeping my balance.  I feel like falling over every time I get up.  Plus my eyesight hasn't been right ever since.  I think It is damaged.


Im not sure why I suspect it, but I think I might have had a stroke while I was passed out.  My leg and arm were both sore on one side of my body, plus half of my face has dead skin peeling off it, and it's the same side as the sore limbs.* 


***If anyone knows why this might be, I'd love a little insight.***

Welp, you got fucked.


No but really I'm glad that you're okay, most of the symptoms you are describing seem to be typical after such a traumatic event, so I wouldn't worry too much about them. The more severe stuff is questionable, but I would assume you passed out and (as common with alot of heavy opiate abusers) simply rested too hard on a certain side of your body, messing with it's circulation/coordination. The results from nodding like this are highly variable, but that's the first thing that came to mind when you said that (not saying that's what it is, just an idea). 

I highly doubt you had like, a mini-stroke haha that would seem to have much too severe of consequences for you to just have some dry skin. That's something that could be from a totally unrelated event and it just seems to have correlated, not saying it is, again, just a brainstorm.


I'd say to wait it out, filter out the stuff that persists from the stuff that doesn't, and then go ahead and get it checked out.

No one over the internet can tell you forsure, so keep that in mind.

One day my buddy had some watson fent (if thats the gel brand). So I bought it. I sooo happy as I was like drug wise this is on my bucket list..so I got home, its a 100mch. so I open it up take all the gel and start smoking(I was naive to know how strong it was) then I chewed it after than. I woke up with paramedics around me. I was young and stupid then. Now I know my limits and how much to do/space out.

Thank you for being so kind.  I really do appreciate it ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)


As for the pain I think you are right.  My vision has cleared up quite a bit, I don't feel like falling over anymore when I walk, and my arms soreness has gone down.  My leg pain is still here, but I think that's just because it got the worst of it.  As for the dry skin, I wonder if it's possible that maybe I slept on my face in a certain way, i was sleeping face down for the very first part.  After I had the "chat" with my dad is when i started sleeping on my back.


Anyways, I think I'm going to be okay, I just need to deal with the ministry of transport, and get this rehab thing out of the way, i need my license.  It shouldnt be too hard so long as I lay off the stuff for awhile.

Oh, also, I went to my doctor about a day after I was discharged from the hospital.  He wasn't much help.  He told me to take some Advil and Reactin lol.  Who knows, maybe that's all I need.

Perhaps plugging may be an effective way to administer? I only have experience with the gel patches thus far regarding Fentanyl. I get a small scale-able 


amount of water ( like in a shot glass) and add the gel fillings of the fent into it. Heat up the water and mix the two together. After you can draw the mix into 


an oral syringe and rectally administer it. ![=D](https://bluelight.org/xf/BL_Images/Orig_Emoji/biggrin.gif)

I got my hands on 10mg of pure fent.


I dissolved it in a sterile container, that I added 30ml of sterile water too.


I used a mg scale that is accurate to weight it, it was between 9.5-10mg.


That means 300ug per ml of solution, aka .3mg per ml or equopotent to 30mg of morphine each ml.


I stirred the solution vigorously and allowed to sit for several hours.  It is completely clear, the fent dissolved almost instantly.


I've been injecting between 1-2ml per dose, which is equal to 30-60mg of morphine injected.  I started at 1ml of course and worked my way up to 2ml shots.  I wait several hours between doses.


It hasn't caused me to nod yet but provides a fast, pleasant, warm opiate high.  


It's not quite as euphoric as say heroin or oxy, but it provides a nice opiate buzz nevertheless and the solution in total is equivalent to 1 gram of iv morphine, or a gram of decent h.  The best part is, the pure fent came from a reliable vendor and I was very cautious when handling the fentanyl and making the solution.  So back to the best part, the 10mg of fent cost me less then an oxy 40mg would, and yet is equal to like 20 oxy 40mgs, for 2000% cheaper.


I don't have a habit yet either, I've always controlled my usage by going on a few day bender, and then quitting cold turkey for at least a week.  Most I've ever had was minor withdrawals that cud be cured by a low dose taper of kratom.


Warning though, fentanyl is dangerous when you take unknown doses of fent gel from the patches or get fent laced heroin.  Only use it if you absolutely know the dosage of fent your taking and it should always be dissolved into a liquid solution that is marked as poison or at least some type of warning, and it should be carefully stored out of reach from anyone but yourself as well in the first place.  Also, triple check you did your math right when making the solution.


Stay safe fent users.

I haven't worn them, only because when I initially open the package, there is visible gel leaked out of the patch. I know that this has accounted for several fatal OD's, and I understand that once you wear a patch it takes awhile to work/get out of your system.

I did this with out swallowing for around 20 min- 1 hour and got noticible effects, but nothing compared to oxy. I don't smoke or inject.

I think in a 50ug/hr patch there is roughly 5mg of fentanyl.  So take a patch that has not leaked or broken, and squeeze all the gel out into a little prescription pill bottle or something with a cap.  Now decide how much fent you want per ml.  For a 100ug/1 ml solution, measure 50ml of sterile water, add it to the gel and shake vigorously for several hours.  You should now have a instant release solution of 100ug fent per ml of water, which is about equal to 10mgs of morphine or a few Percs.  You can then dose either sublingually, nasaly, or plug the solution.  For all three of these methods, I recommend a 100 unit insulin syringe or a similar needle, which you then can pull the needle tip out of the syringe with a pair of plyers.


Your ready to go, 100 units is close to 3.5mls so 30 units is about a ml.  Draw up your dose into your now needle less syringe, and then either slowly drip it into your nostrils, a few drops at a time so it doesn't drip down ur throat.  U can also plug it with the syringe, or just drip the solution under your tongue and let it sit for sublingual administration.  I wouldn't recommend iving a solution made with gel.


As always with a fent liquid solution, keep it in a dark cool place that is out of reach from children or opiate naive adults.  Also label as dangerous so if someone snooping around that just so happens to find it at least has a warning.  Careless storage of fentanyl solutions can easily cause death.


Be careful, do your solution math and triple check your math.  Fentanyl can be safely administered by a responsible person, but it can also kill you from a simple careless error.  So pay attention, stay safe guys.

I got to wonder if he's getting a  little senile.  I wanted to go to the hospital, but me being me (ie an  idiot) i was too scared to get in trouble with my parents (more so  afraid of shaming them with me doing something so dumb) So i stumbled  around my room, falling over things.  I hid what i could, and put on a  jacket.  My dad was watching tv in the next room, and my mom hadnt  gotten home yet from work.  I sort of stumble ran out the house, got in  the car and started it.  Of course my mom pulls in the driveway as im  walking to the car.  i sort of wave hi to her, acting as if everythings  cool n im just going out.  I get in the car, of course she wants to talk  to me.  Shes all where are you going, its icy out be careful!!  and im  trying to pretend im not dying.  anyways, i drive to the hospital while  od'ing on fentanyl.  possibly the dumbest thing ive ever done.

It was unpleasant.

I know what i  did was stupid, but its so fucked up how they can punish you for being  honest, where someone who is dishonest would get off scott free.  fuck  our society.  they assume a drug user must be a drug abuser.  they dont  know the difference, yet they claim to have equality and be tolerant.   those are just words to them, they dont truly know the meaning.

25 ug of fentanyl powder would basically be a few grains of sand in size.  Like 1/30th the size of a match head, maybe less.  You really can't eyeball fentanyl powder, it is too potent.  Take the 100mgs, and dissolve it in 200-1000 ml of sterile water/sterile saline so you have a solution that can be accurately dosed.  If you use 200ml of water, you will have 500ug (half a mg) of fentanyl per 1 ml.  This is equivalent to around 50mg of morphine or 30-40mg of oxy.  I'd recommend using 1000ml though since you have a low tolerance, this way your solution contains 100ug or .1mg of fentanyl per ml, which is equal too 10mg of morphine or a few Percs (per each ml)


You can now safely dose your fent, I recommend using a small syringe with the needle removed to dose.  Either slowly drip it into your nose from the needless syringe a few drops at a time so it doesn't drip down ur throat, or plug the solution.  You can also just put a ml or two of the solution under your tongue and let it sit for sublingual absorption.  


Make sure the fentanyl is fully dissolved before using the solution, I recommend shaking it every few minutes for an hour or two before dosing.  This way it is evenly distributed through the liquid solution.  Use sterile water or a sterile saline solution as your liquid to dissolve the fent in.  You can then add half an ounce or so of strong vodka or ever clear or another high proof clear alcohol, so your solution is preserved better and won't grow bacteria.  


I don't recommend you inject it with a low tolerance, but if you do I recommend making a smaller volume solution as you really don't want to iv a solution that has been sitting around for months, no matter how well you store it, as it will still grow bacteria over time when you open it and expose it to air, as this allows anything in the air to get in and eventually the smallest bacteria may thrive and you'll potentially get an abscess or "Cotten fever" from iving a solution that has been sitting around for months.


If you wish to make a solution for iv, you will need a highly accurate mg scale, and I'd recommend just measuring out 5-10mgs of fentanyl and making a more potent sterile water or saline solution that you will use in a few days at most.  For an iv solution of fent, I personally would use about 30ml of sterile solution, and about 10mg of fentanyl this way your solution is more potent for injection.  1ml = 300ug of fentanyl, which is equal to about 30mg of iv morphine or 20-25mg iv oxy.


Start small, no more then 100ug as a starting dose and weight an hour minimum between doses.  I'd recommend you stick with a less potent solution and just plug, sniff or sublingually dose ur liquid solution.


As always with fentanyl, make sure you have an accurate well calibrated mg scale to weigh ur fentanyl when making any solution.


Triple check your math as well before dosing, and always start as small as you can.


Fentanyl can be safe when made into a carefully measured liquid solution by a responsible user, but carelessness can lead to instant death with fent.  Be careful, stay safe.


Sorry for three posts in a row, I'm on some ethylphenidate right now alongside some fent, so I'm typing long ass responses because of the ethylphenidate mental stimulation xd


Hope this helps someone.

Is Fentanyl HCL the same as what's given to you when you're in the hospital?  I'm trying to figure out exactly what Fentanyl HCL is compared to the patches, what you receive in the hospital, etc.

Watson gel Fentanyl patch 25 mcg


I'm new to the fent patch n had a few questions (yes I've used the search engine). Can you cut the patch in half? Can you chew on the patch if cut into pieces n if so can you use the old patch? What is some of the best way to get the most out of this patch? 


I've recently applied my patches on with heat from a blow dryer, it seemed to work quicker. I do have a high tolerance. I also take oxycodone IR for break through pain. In the past with fentanyl I've taken the 100 mcg patch (thought I was gna die cuz I wasn't very opiate tolerable n this was years ago) and the lollipops. 


Thanks,

DubbyCee

Abstral 800mcg question


I get a lot of these monthly and was just wondering if I used intranasally instead of sublingually will it work better? I have tried both ways and I don't feel any difference I'm just wondering since the nasal bioavailability is higher I'm trying to get the lazanda instead but it's extremely expensive like the most expensive one out of all of them.

There seems to be very little information on this chemical despite its wide availability. I recently went through a large quantity of 150ug blotter a friend had donated due to not wanting. I now understand why.


I will try to update this post with more information, but being a non-habitual opiate user most would generally recommend people such as myself avoid Fent due to dosages/safety. I will say it is extremely heavy on the respiratory system, more so it is very more-ish - I once heard described as the crack of opiates definitely true. The stuff is bit unpredictable for a nod which again makes it very more-ish. I went from occasional evening use of 2-3 tabs at maximum to dosing regularly daily. I lost interest in normal things without fentanyl. I've went through withdrawal twice, this is my final time as I consumed them all and can't get anymore. I'm over the worst.


But, honestly this stuff is too strong an opiate and fucks with the dopamine receptors far, far too much to recreationally use in my opinion. This was 3-4 months of usage, cannot wait to get over these last few days no longer have the temptation and get back to enjoying life. ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png) Although I now have a much better understanding of how my friends turned heroin addicts have became so personally emotionally unstable and unable to withstand criticism. It is a very self-loathing high in my opinion, I lost a bit of my skin as such while on this, taking anything that was said very personally especially during WDs/comedown. 


Euphoria not on same level as other opiates. Although more functional so much more easy to hide/maintain. Also highly affects sex drive, literally killed mine at a point, mines about 70-80% on last few days of WD, if you're in a relationship you'll be out of one soon using this stuff.

Oh I'm on palliative care because of medical issues I have severe pain and currently take roxanol  (liquid morphine) 20mg per ml every 2hrs prn (600mls per month) methadone 50mg 3x per day and abstral 800mcg every 2hrs prn. Nothing makes me sleepy or high anymore, even taken with my klonopin and or fioricet and I still have severe pain. Spending almost all day home alone in a hospital bed is a shitty existence no matter what drugs you have.

Why does Fentanyl come in IR and ER Transdermal formulations, but nto ER tablets? If it does, why are these so rarely prescribed, and the transdermal patches more common? I can't fucking stand the patches so I've just rotated back to Oxycodone tablets and it got me wondering...

Because patches make the halflife longer and fentanyl has a 92% transdermal bioavailability when swallowed is like 30%

This is probably a stupid question and maybe the wrong place to post it (sorry if so).  I was taking MSIR 30mg every 6-8 hours for a while, I believe since August 2014.  My doctor switched me to Fentanyl 50 mcg for chronic pain but I had insurance trouble and couldn't get it til today.  I went about a week without taking anything.  Would the 50 mcg patch be too much after a week of no medication?  I've been reading about Fentanyl all day and have gotten really freaked out.  I worked in a pharmacy as a tech for five years and somehow never realized how potent Fentanyl is.  I just want to wear the patch as prescribed but I'm not too thrilled at the idea of ODing and dying because of it.

If it was me then I would be ok with it. I can not make a suggestion either way as people are different. I was prescribed 100mcg patches - I always got the sandoz brand. Tried to get high on it a couple times, but gave up - pain relief was the priority and I could not waste a patch for a buzz.

I've been reading the Fent threads for two days solid and I'm very frustrated.  It seems much of the information is inaccurate, inconsistent or written by people who can't seem to form a coherent sentence.  I find it humorous when these folks start out "...going to make this absolutely crystal clear" and then immediately start to tell you how stoned and fucked up they are at the time of writing.  But that's another story.  Here's what I've concluded and I'd appreciate it if someone/anyone can tell me where my rationale is incorrect.


First a little background.  I had been on 120-160mg oxy/day for a couple of years until I lost my doc, moved and could get no more.  That was a couple years ago.  Recently, over the past couple of weeks I've found and have been taking about 50-60mg oxy/at a time/once a day.  I am a middle aged male, 6ft and ~230lbs.  I recently came across a Mylan (non-gel) 75mcg/h patch.  I would like to administer it buccally.  So my issue is safe dosing.  I don't want to be high for 3 days.


Using any medically accepted conversion chart, about 30-60mg oxycodone would require a 25mcg/h patch.  Assuming that's going to deliver 72 hours worth of effect, roughly equal to what you'd get from about 50mg of oxycodone, would you not cut the patch into 72 equal size pieces and administer it buccually?  Or, would you cut the pieces larger based on the number of hours you wanted to be high?  For example, 72/6=12 pieces (6 being the number of hours for effect).


Originally Leftwing suggested: "Start off with cutting the equivalent to 6mcg/hr, so ½ of a 12mcg patch", for buccal administration.  That seems like about 3X as much as I proposed in my example above.


I've also read all of the warnings on here about the drug not being equally distributed over the patch but I've read from mfg. websites that this is not true.  At least not these days.  I recognize that many of the posts are 10 years old now.


So, based on my tolerance level, if anyone could suggest, along with some explanation/rationale, how many pieces to cut the patch into, I'd greatly appreciate it.  Keep in mind that the patch I have is a 75mcg/h Mylan non-gel.  So please don't tell me I need to stick half of it in my jaw when you're really talking about a 12mcg/h patch.  I can do the conversion, just be sure and let me know what you're experienced with if you're not making purely mathematical calculations in determining a safe and pleasurable dose.  Many thanks!

^  whatever you dose buccally is released all at once, or over about 10-15 minutes. When you dose buccally it no longer releases the fent over a 72 hour period. Fent isn't a super long lasting opioid, although with no tolerance it lasted me for hours. Most people say it wears off fast, and when I did it often it did wear off faster


I got 75 mcg sandoz when I first got them (also a nongel) and yes you are correct the fent is spread evenly. I used to cut it into about 10 pieces and put one in my lower gum like people do with chewing tobacco. The sandoz hit very quickly and in fact they took these particular ones off the market in January 2013. Left me with quite the habit. But that's another story 


You are not going to be high for 72 hours dosing buccally. A few hours from a dose tops. When I started with those I had a small oxycodone habit. If I were you I would cut it into about 10 or 12 pieces, try one and see how it goes. Are these patches clear ones or tan ones? The tan ones are very hard to get a good buccal dose out of. I believe they have an extra layer in the matrix to prevent abuse. I think people used alcohol or citric to break it down. All I know is I tried those tan ones and got maybe 1/10 of what I got from the sandoz. Now, the other clear ones are ok. You'd be ok with 10-12 pieces cut. Honestly if it's the tan ones you might want to start with like 8 or so. 


Any other particular questions?  (PS. I've been off all but methadone for a year or so..so I'm not fucked up lol. But I know what you mean)

Hey crzydiamond!  Thanks for the info.  I had sort of concluded that 15 pieces would be about right given my relative low tolerance level.  I found another post on a different board that suggested 16 pieces.  Your suggestion of 10-12 pieces further confirms that I'm in the right dosing zone.  I knew there was a problem with my logic in terms of cutting it into 72 pieces.  That would have been difficult and a little, make that a lot, extreme.  What I didn't understand was how the drug was released if not over the 72 hours and you addressed that as well.  I really enjoy the opiate warm and fuzzies so I hope I get that.  There seems to be a lot of contradiction on that point but I think most of it comes down to how it's administered.  Simply applying the patch to skin seems to be very effective for pain management but not so much for warm and fuzzies so that's why I was opting for the buccal rought.  Anyway, Many thanks!

oh, btw, I'm not sure which I have, clear or tan.  I just know they are made by Mylan and they are non-gel.  It's still in the package and I'm hesitant to open until ready for use.

AFOAF, just wanted to share this picture of their extraction of spent fentanyl gel patches. AFOAF get's the 50mcg/hour gel patches. Only 10 in a month. In another state AFOAF lived in they were getting the same gel patches only the doc was giving them to AFOAF 15 a month so 1 every 48 hours instead of every 72/hours. Problem is, when AFOA gets the 10 for this month, They sit in the parking lot after getting the script filled and immediately put 1 on, usually on their chest. The other 9 this last month, AFOAF wound up using all in 2 days. Guess they have a very high tolerance.

So I posted last night about AFOAF and their extract process. But now AFOAF wants to know about what the conversion should be if AFOAF had been on a Methadone Maintenance Program for 3 years at a 1 time daily dose of 90-100mg, and is getting the Fent Patches now instead. AFOAF has said that it doesn't seem to be enough (The Fent 50mcg/hour). To the point where when AFOAF wakes up in the morning, his entire body feels somewhat numb/tingling feeling/pulsating feeling, almost like they feel their entire heartbeat throughout their entire body. This isn't something this person had ever experienced with patches until now, the Methadone never did this either, but once he got off the M.M.P. this feeling started happening, and has continued even to this day. It doesn't happen constantly, mainly when this person wakes up, sometimes it'll wake AFOAF up in the middle of the night. Or even when they are just sitting down. Any suggestions as to what this could be?

Did anyone else read the studies where subjects were unaware of which they were taking for pain, Bupe or Fent, and the bupe patch seemed to actually relieve pain better in every way except 12 months and beyond, at which point the fent population was asking for substantially less rescue doses?  I am considering adding the 7.5mcg butrans patch to my 15mg 3X daily morphinedose.  Anybody think it will be worth the constipation?  My neck pain makes my life hellish at times.

I have a fentanyl problem. I got my hands on a 75mcg/HR patch. I am thinking of cutting it into pieces. But I am new to fentanyl so i am not sure the safest way to go about it. I am not new to opiates by any means going on 10 year addiction. Anything anyone knows would be helpful.

**Ingesting Fentanyl Patches - Found awesome medical data**


I found an awesome medical paper, written by two doctors, with some great clinical data on ingesting Fentanyl patches. It's written from an ER doctors pov. Good stuff.


This is the link directly to the PDF file:

[http://www.moshp.com/associations/10761/files/Fentanyl Patch.pdf](http://www.moshp.com/associations/10761/files/Fentanyl%20Patch.pdf)


To download or read via browser here's the link for that. The file you're looking for is about 1/4 down the page entitled "Fentanyl Patch..pdf"

So I have the 12.5 mcg mylan patches tried a 1/4 of one for about 15 minutes under my tongue nothing at all happened ?  Tried half still nothing. Am I doing something wrong? Thinking maybe a whole one? I do have a tolerance 40 mg of hydro and or oxy at a time couple times a day. Any help here?

Hi All - a great thread on Fentanyl and a big shout out and kudos to all those who've spent their spare time advising us on HR advice with regards to Fentanyl use. As most replies just state 'Don't fuck with Fent' - and I've experienced why first hand. I once made an honest mistake in miscalculating my Fent dosage when rotating from Morphine to Fent transdermal patches and OD'd on it at home. However, my dad unexpectedly returned home from work that morning to pick up his mobile phone that he left at home that day to find me KO'd on the bathroom floor to take me to A&E/the ER room for admittance to Hospital and the administration of Naloxone. I don't believe in fate, and it's no exaggeration, but if he hadn't have left his phone at home, I'd most probably have seen my OD through to the end and died at home - due to an accidental miscalculation. 


I'm after some HR advice for using Fentanyl recreationally. Does anybody know of an fairly universally accepted rate for converting either oral Oxycodone/Morphine doses to buccal Fent patch doses?


I just want some guidance on the opening post's accuracy with regards to recreational use of Fent, as whilst I really do appreciate the guidance, I'm not convinced by it's accuracy? Before I go on, I used to be a chronic pain management patient with 3 years of opiate use and at points I used to use Fentanyl trans patches for therapeutic pain relief. I withdrew from daily opiate use last month on 4th July and have just started using them after 1 month sober as a weekend treat . I have 3x 12mcg patches that are due to expire in 8 weeks so want to use them whilst I can. My tolerance is currently at ~60mg Oxycodone/100mg Morphine for recreational use.

Make sure it’s the actual sticky adhesive part against your cheek, that’s where the drug is stored after all.

So following the aforementioned advice, and halving the 120mg Oxycodone dose to match my 60mg Oxycodone, that would mean halving the suggested 6mcg/hr patch to a 3mcg/hr patch for buccal use - which is just 1/4 of my 12mcg patches. However, 3mcg/hr really doesn't seem to equate to 60mg Oxycodone when used bucally - or am I wrong? That just seems way too low to equate to 60mg Oxycodone/100mg Morphine. Is there any accepted ratio calculation that you guys use? 


As said, I have 3x patches so I'm happy to mix it up and whilst I'd like to experience a nice buccal high, I'd also like to try plugging it, just to see what it's like. I've never plugged Fent.


So yeah basically, 60mg Oxycodone/100mg Morphine currently gives me a nice buzz, so:


A) What's an equipotent dose for buccal administration using transdermal ?


B) What's an equipotent dose of Fentanyl for rectal administration? 

B2) Should I know anything about plugging Fent before I try? i.e. method of extraction etc...?

For HR reasons I always over-estimate the potency of fentanyl at 100x iv morphine, but in reality fentanyl citrate (what's in most medical product) is 60-70x iv morphine and fentanyl HCL (common street fent) is around 85x iv morphine. oral morphine being 1/4 as potent as iv. I prefer to use the 100x calculation because it is easy to do and you need not adjust for cross tolerance. 100mg oral morphine = 25mg IV morphine = 250mcg (.25mg) morphine IV. I'd start with around 250mcg buccally just to make sure you're not hyper sensitive to it and it doesn't cause chest wall rigidity (very rare), than work you're way up 50mcg at a time. Never NEVER EVER mix fent with anything else such as benzos and/or alcahol or other opioids. Honestly, fentanyl is a lot better for pain management than recreation. I'd recommend not using any other route than buccally as tolerance will build very quickly if plugged, iv'd or used intranasally. I take fentanyl for severe pain and on a bad day I can get up to 50-75mg yes MG not mcg, per day, that's how high my tolerance got when I used it improperly. 


If you choose to regularly use fentanyl, be cautious and control your usage, limit your daily intake and try ti achieve a stable dosage  so tolerance increases minimally... If your fentanyl tolerance gets extremely high, you will never feel any other opiods again. There's a word that I can't think of right now, but basically it means fentanyl has a property that will increase you're tolerance 5-10x faster than any other drug not counting half life. If you include half life, tolerance can increase up to 50x faster that the common opiates. 


I don't recommend fentanyl for anything but pain, as it gives the maximum pain relief with the minimum nod and opiated effects. Be very very careful. I'd recommend you stay with the common opiates and not venture into the world of superpotent opioids.


Also, fentanyl withdrawal is the most intence w/d ever... it only lasts 3 days, but those are the worst 3 days of your life. It feels like you're spine is on fire, breaking and being crushed all at once. The bone pain and muscle pain is extremely severe. The pain in the legs is so severe that I have to crawl up the stairs on all fours. A combination of phenergan or compazine and zofran can barely take away even 50% of the nausea if you're lucky. The sweating is the most severe I've ever experienced. At one point my spine was super hot to the touch, as in it hurt my fingers to touch it as it was so hot. 


If you chose to make a habit of it, make sure to have some gabapentin on hand, clondine helps tremendously too if you can get it. I recommend that you take a 3 day break every 2 weeks not 3 weeks. After 2 weeks, when you take a 3 day break, the W/D can be almost completely controlled with gabapentin. This strategy also will keep your tolerance down somewhat and always allow you an out any time you want without such severe withdrawal, it still sucks, but it isn't tartarus in hell. You can still be completely functional. I'm not recommending in any way that a fentanyl habit is a good thing, but most people end up following that path anyway, so I figured I'd supply a guide that will let them quit any time they want.

Heyy, im new to the site. Litterally just signed up. I have a quick question. Im pretty familiar with the fent patch. Although it is rare, so its not often i get to do it. Ive had a few 75-50 mg patches. Always cut them into smaller pieces and chew them to get extremelyyy high. But lately all i can get is the 12 mg patches. I have cut them in half and been pretty buzzed but it only seems to get weaker and last shorter. So my QUESTION IS should i just stick the whole patch on my body instead of chew it???

Of course i could try not cutting it and chewing the whole thing, but i dont want to be drooling lol

My tolerance is ok, not too high but not low either so im basically wondering if it would be worth it to try sticking it or would it be a waste.. thanks!!

I jut recently was prescribed fentanyl patches, I leave it on for a couple days then I'll throw it in my mouth. I'm not sure if I'm chewing them right. I could use some advice on how to do it properly. My doc wanted me to try these, he knows that they are not strong enough for me, but he wanted me to get used to the fentanyl before he prescribed stronger one. Please give advice on how to chew it

hold the sticky part against your cheek and try not to swallow too much saliva. That should last you 4-6 hours. You can gently chew on it and reapply on the side of your cheek once your high starts to wane.

So I have read this entire thread and looked at the dose conversion table and have not found much information on the 1600mcg actiq lollies. Anyone use these regularly?  If so, how do they work for you? 


I'm a CPP and have been prescribed 10/325 hydro 5 daily and ms contin 30 2x daily but I usually end up taking double that and run out of pills early and my PM refuses to change my meds. Anyway I got my hands on some 1600 mg actiq lollies and started small and only ate about 1/4 of it. Waited 45 mins, didn't feel much, so ate more,  waited and more. Never felt a rush or euphoria of any kind. Pain control was decent compared with  what I was taking but had to eat almost whole lollie for that.


Overall it was kind of meh,  any thoughts?

I searched BL and read this thread but couldn't find an answer to my question so thought I would ask here:


Why does it say not to cover a fent patch with a bandaid? Why does it have to be a clear cover? I have large waterproof bandaid to use over my patch to ensure it doesn't fall off but I don't want to use a band aid if it somehow makes the patch ineffective. 


TIA for your reply ![:)](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/joypixels/assets/8.0/png/unicode/64/1f642.png)

Hey I just got ahold of some fentanyl spray... It's 600mcg a spray I was wondering how I can break that down to smaller doses I think 600 is a little much for me lol... Any suggestions? Spray on weed and smoke? spray in water and drop? Spray in dope pipe and vape?

No no no no youre going to waste your subsys  all of the fentanyl products that are not patches are very expensive and as far as I know especially with the nasal spray and the sub lingo spray which I know you have the sublingual spray called subsys.not do anything with it except lift your tongue up and spray it under your tongue then let it dissolve you can't squirt have failed or anything like that it will all come out.  All of these products the TRF products instant release fentanyl are extremely expensive because of the way they are made. The one that seems to relieve the most pain for me is the lazanda the nasal spray but it's like $30,000 a month from my insurance to pay in the subsys isn't far behind that I've tried all of that onsolis  and it doesn't seem that great anyways its just a little past that dissolves inside your cheek and then there's ABSTRAL which is sublingual and dissolve so fast and I'm currently on fentora which I don't like very much but it's like 207 tablets for 15 bucks through a coupon


The lazanda and subsys are the best because they are absorbed into the bloodstream the fastest, faster than any of the others which means the potency is stronger as it may be slightly slower than IV it is really fast but they're also the two most expensive

First time posting anything on here.


Anyways I have a tolerance of about 100mg of narcos. I would say my opioid tolerance is pretty low considering I can take 3 or 4 narcos and feel pretty chill.  Anyways I've came upon a 50mcg fentanyl patch. Which I've gotten for a considerable low cost, I would compare it to the cost of 4 10mg narcos where I am from. I've had it for about 2 weeks and have been very cautious do to the fact of all the things I've read about fentanyl online. So I have a tremendous amount of respect for this drug. 


Anyways, last night I decided to cut a small square off the patch last night and gum it. I didn't really feel much. So this morning when I woke up I cut a larger portion of the patch off and began to gum the strip. It's been about 45-1hr and I do feel relaxed and calm. I would say I would prefer a narco high compared to this. I would say it's fairly safe if you start by cutting small portions and giving yourself about an hour to see how you feel.

Need w/d info pleeze.. I'm RX'd methadone 10 mg tabs X4day and ran out . I happened to come across a few 50 mg Fent Patches to help with withdrawals . Now those are gone & I don't get my methadone refill for 5 days. What will help with withdrawals from patches? I feel AWFUL. I'm also prescribed Adderall 30 mg, and was contemplating weather or not those would help or not.

Hello ?.mdcaseyjones.  First off,  DO NOT TAKE ANY ADDERROL OR OTHER STIMULANT. This will increase withdrawal symptoms like anxiety agitation insomnia anger possibly convulsions but probably not based on the amount of narcotics you take but you could have convulsions if you take a lot of adderall instead of taking none I've been and make a withdrawal where I was having convulsions in the hospital know that they didn't do anything. But since I've been on palliative care for so long which is very similar to hospice care except you're just not dying yet.,

The best thing you could do is try to see your doctor immediately I don't know if he'll have a tantrum or even notice depends on him. The next best thing would be to have a friend who could help you out with your regular dose of methadone enough for you see the doctor you don't want to be amplifying it with fentanyl patches are going to be taking the time with the trust your tolerance will go up and down and you'll have withdrawal symptoms going up and down and you don't want to deal with that. Lion Air you're not isn't sorry because I'm on palliative care I'm using voice to text cuz my arm has issues you are able to get a pallet of Pain Doctor Who is not limited in what they can prescribe like regular pain doctors thicket have you won 5 extended release things and 5 instant release things you know not just one extended-release like I methadone or oxycontin or MS Contin or whatever that you can have as many of those and like for instance what I'm on now but I just I don't like to tell people that I know especially like the mechanics cuz they want to come around and mooch but I receive 300 10 milligram methadone per month, 180 40 milligram generic OPANA ER, 180 10 milligram OPANA IR,  180 dilaudid 8mg,  I also used to get 900ccs of 20mg per cc concentrated morphine brand name roxanol…. But even tho my dose was 5cc as needed every two hrs,  or 100mg its too weak. Did. Nothing  so doc n I discontinued. So my methadone was 60mg 3 times a day but here they made max monthly 300 10 tabs so stupid when a methadone clinic not far away ,,,a has many patients taking 250 milligrams every morning which would be the equivalent of 750 10 milligram tablets for months lol except they give you liquid and it takes two years to get 27 days worth at once oh well. And then the strongest thing I get is for breakthrough pain is instant release fentanyl called FENTORA which I usually get 207 of months through the coupon and sometimes only 73 or 72 a month through the coupon my doctor wants me to be able to have 350 of the month but 207 is enough to get by on and it takes two of them into one so Centura as like around 5:15 about 60% oral bioavailability in each pill is 800 micrograms someone points 6 milligrams I guess I absorb somewhere between 902 micrograms in 1 milligram of it or something but sometimes I take for and I don't know why but you know I've been on does fentanyl patches and they just get me like really really angry and mean and range wolf but then the instant releases just fine so yeah I would definitely of War II scoring the cheap stuff for the cheap you know powdery white stuff because it might be cheaper but it's also going to stones are cheap you should just try to get enough for 5 days does date 3d floor and day but I mean they're just all really rough days and you don't want to go into the doctor looking like you have a flu so serious you should be in the hospital you know that mean if you have anymore questions or you like to talk just respond and stuff for send me a private message I'll give you my email on my facebook for whatever works. Best of luck I hate to hear about your own withdrawal it's just not fair and it's beyond not fair of the stupid statement life isn't fair I mean you were never told when you started taking this that if you run out early or you're going to be experiencing one of the worst things in your life so I would say get some downers of course if you like if you have her before

**FENTANYL 25mcg/h transdermal patch**


**Ok so listen please don't bore me with warnings, disclaimers, quotes from the bible or anything other than answers to what the fuck I wanna know. I'm well aware of my actions and I'm looking for something specific. I'm looking for the high that I want. I'm an advocate for narcotics anonymous and all about preventing overdoses, but right now that is not the time. I am on a severe full-blown relapse and although I need help I'll be damned if I'm not gonna fix tonight!!!


**Now that I got that out of the way, I apologize if I sounded crude, rude or insensitive. I need some help, today I got 2 25mcg/h fentanyl transdermal patches. 

![WTS31980.JPG](https://www.bluelight.org/community/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fhealthy.kaiserpermanente.org%2Fstatic%2Fdrugency%2Fimages%2FWTS31980.JPG&hash=2d552ed45974f47834c094dcce1f3c1e)I LOVE FENTANYL.  I've only had the luxury of slamming china white a handful of times and of course I was in love. The amount that it takes to get high made me fall in love and of course the high itself.  I usually get the 12 mcg/h patches from my friend which don't have the gel.  but her doc stepped her up to the 25's and I think they have the gel. from what I've read people call that the matrix, right?? anyways, I squeezed out the shit of the first one onto foil to smoke it and that clearly didn't work out.  So now i'm committed to cherishing this last one I have and doing it just right because I only get the opportunity to do china white or the patch once every other decade.  Don't worry I'm a big boy and not stupid enough to slam a whole thing in my neck. Although at times I wish I was that dumb. BUT NOT TODAY.  So what I've read to extract the shit I need like 90% isopropyl alcohol. The only rubbing alcohol I got is 50 % but can't i use vinegar or lemon juice and water or what?  Somebody please tell me **WHAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY TO EXTRACT FENTANYL OUT OF THIS GEL PATCH? 


**

and don't worry and don't worry about what I'm going to do with it after that.  I promise I'll be safe and post my results.  Thanks in advance

When I would get the 12 mcg/h's I would just put it in my cheek and get hella faded. But I don't think those had the gel, like this one does. I just don't want to waste it bcuz I know the potential it has and it's not very easy to get

**NEW UPDATE!!!!


**ok since I opened my second and final patch I've cooked up 2 shots.  I know I said I'd try different methods with this one, but whatever I lied.  I just stuck to the vinegar/ water version that I heard on this forum.  So the first time I did it I didn't feel shit,  which sucked. Bet let me tell you something the second time, which was about ten minutes ago.  ***HALLELUJAH, PRAISE THE LORT***; I HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT AND FINALLY SCRATCHED THAT ITCH THAT WAS BOTHERING ME ALL WEEK LONG.  I feel brand new again. ok wait that's a lie, I just feel high enough to finally relax and pass the fuck out in peace.  Fuck all the built up stress and shit.Ya dig??  My work here is done. Thank you to all that helped guide me in this matter . You know who are if you write anything useful.  If not then please read something useful, because it helps. 


IN CONCLUSION:D


for any of the gel - type fentanyl patches, I've found that if you squeeze not all of it but just a bit into a cooker.  Add one part white vinegar and two parts water, then lightly heat.  Don't heat for very long at all because the liquid is going to dissolve uber quickly.  I even blew on it a little to help evaporate the vinegar because I didn't heat it very much at all.  YOU DON'T NEED TOO.  Throw in a filter, suck it up..... well I'm sure you can figure it out from there. 


Didn't I read somewhere that this hi isn't euphoric???  THEY'RE LYING 


I'm good to go, I'm even going to prepare tomorrow's shot before I go to bed.  YAY!!!!  and to even top it off-  this won't show up in my drug test for drug court.  BONUS!!! that is a five star day if you ask me...  ;-) much love much blessings fellow addicts.  BE SAFE

If you can get your hands on some Clonidine and Ativan or Xanax those help with WD. The Clonidine is pretty easy to get as it's generally a blood pressure medication but it is prescribed for multiple reasons. I have it for sleep. I always try to plan when I'll run out of my stuff so that I'm not working and I can medicate and sleep off the first day or 2 of WD. Since I've stockpiled my patches I now use those when I don't have pills along with Gabapentin, Clonidine, and Ativan.

I am just curious on how people can come across Subsys on the street.


I was prescribed Subsys (1200mcg, x5 daily) and it was the best thing in the world for me, regarding pain control.  Then, Insurance stopped paying for it and we went to court.  In the end, I qualify again for Subsys due to my issues, but they have chosen a less expensive drug, Abstral.


For those who are unaware, Subsys @ 1200 mcg - 5 times daily - is around $39,000 a month.  Abstral, which is a sublingual tablet instead of a spray, at the same dose of 1200mcg is $31,000 a month.  My co-pay is $1,000 a week for these drugs.  This is after the Pharmaceutical company has chipped in to help pay.


I was on Subsys for 3 months (6k mcg a day), and was on Abstral for 3 months.  It worked quite well for chronic pain issues.


I will warn everyone though that is intending to take it for recreational purposes; find something else.  I say this, simply for the fact that after the 2nd month of Subsys I have never had a euphoric feeling again for any opiate taken.  As seen in this thread here: [Scale of Strength Opiates](https://www.bluelight.org/vb/threads/784781-Scale-of-Strength-High-dosages-of-Opiates-feedback-requested!), I take a large amount of IV based Dilaudid and it is like taking saline solution.


I was never one to recreational take anything before, but only wish I had that feeling again to help distract the pain and suffering I go through.  I was on a crap load of Fent (two 100mcg patches, 6k mcg daily via Subsys) - and my receptors are gone.  It is VERY difficult to get pain under control these days.  I have a port-a-cath in my chest (direct link to my heart) with 12mg of Dilaudid an hour = and I feel nothing...


YMMV.  Yet, if there is any wisdom to be gained, titrate slowly with any of your opiate abuse to make it last as long as the euphoric feeling can.  Once you lose it like I have, it is a horrible thing.  While being terminal, I have sustained a physical injury (accidental, fractured a bone in my leg) and couldn't get pain relief all that well, due to the consumption from my neurological and muscular disease issues I have.

Honestly I'm curious how anyone comes across anything on the street period. Everything I'm on is prescribed for pain control and I try to figure out ways to hoard what I can. They won't give me enough pills to effectively manage my pain, wouldn't give me enough and took me off the liquids that did, put me on the Fent patch that doesn't do squat for me and are even lowering the dose of it. The state has many doctors scared now. In the past they used to hand out Vic like Tylenol.

Maybe it is people like me, to whom I have a ton of opiate drugs that were filled, tried for a week without much success, and then subscribed something different.  For example, I have a little less than 720 (8mg) tablets of Hydromorphine (dilaudid pills).  I was prescribed 32mg per dose, 6 times daily.  This would equate to 24 pills per day, or 720 a month.  After being on it for a while, we changed medicines.  Maybe family members of ill patients steal them and sell them?


Yet, a pill is one thing.  A Subsys spray bottle is another.  That stuff is liquid gold to the insurance and pharmaceutical companies.

Ok, so I'm very new to bluelight, not sure I'm using the site correctly to find the info I need, but I hope someone can help me out here, there's a lot of info but most is just not specific enough for me to use.

I have a few 75 mcg gel filled fentanyl patches. I am a very heavy opioid user, I currently am on a steady 30 mg methadone daily, and also IV anywhere from 2 to 10 8mg dilaudid daily (depending on my money situation). Yes I have read all the cautions on IV Fent, and the reason I have joined is to make sure I do it correctly, so let's just skip over the warnings and get to the CORRECT instructional informative information, if you please. So I read on here to pull the gel out and let it dry then mix with water, but that seemed to have zero effect. How do I take the gel fentanyl and transform into something that I can safely IV? Do I need to mix with vinegar or isopropyl alcohol? I surely hope someone can help me! I tried smoking it on tin fill....And nothing, whatsoever. They are not expired, just picked up from pharmacy last week, what am I doing wrong here? Thanks in advance!

Hello, I'm very new to bluelight and I have a question. I got 100mg of Fentanyl HCL. I added 10ml of vinegar to it for it to dissolve. Then I added 1 liter of water to that mixture, which gave me 1ml/100mcg. First, I should let you know that I'm plugging it. Well, when I plugged .5ml/50 mcg, I THOUGHT THAT I WAS GONNA OD....FOR REAL!!! I kept getting head rushes for nearly 4 hours and I don't know what I've done wrong. I do not want to use this to get high at all....I got this for pain control. Does anyone know what I've done wrong? I would appreciate any responses. And I am not opiate naive (sp) at all. I can do 40mg of Oxycodone at a dose.

I'm not sure that you've done anything wrong per se but you've pretty much answered your own question...


You took 50mcg of fentanyl and found it too much....


What exactly are you asking?


Have you double checked your math because 50mcg of fentanyl isnt a huge dose....infact it's about half the dose when fentanyl is used medically via IV.

Hey new friend.  So I have a few 75 mcg gel patches that I have been trying to shoot for days.I cannot find any info on this and want to do it the right way! I'm a very experienced user,  with a very high tolerance. Yes I have read all the "don't do it posts" but we all know we will find a way to do it anyways, I just trying to find the right way. So, I can mix the gel with vinegar and water and pull into a nice shot? Thanks!

Hairdr78, sorry no one has answered you yet. I'm also new to Bluelight because of my questions on Fentanyl HCL. I have done a good bit of reading up on ROA's and it seems that the best one is good old plugging the Fentanyl. You have the gel patches so you wouldn't need to add vinegar to it....just warm a small amount of water up and add Fent. gel to it. And FENTANYL IS TO BE RESPECTED!!! Don't use all of the gel. Start out small! I had gotten Fentanyl HCL and I am at a SUPER minimal amount! I can't give you any advice on IV'ing anything because I have never personally done it. I have had 13 back surgeries and the nurses put me through hell getting a vein when putting IV's in me so I have no desire to IV at all. So many people prefer plugging the fent from the patches but do a search first. Just do a quick google search and I'm sure you will find out the amount of water that should be used, how much fent to start out at, etc. Get as much information as you can on this before you do it. And just because you can handle a lot of Oxycodone at one sitting doesn't mean that you can use that whole 75 mcg gel patch! Please, please, just do a google search on plugging fent. gel patches and you be safe....PLEASE! Take Care!!

**Need help...don't understand what is going on!!!**


Hi, so I had 100mg fentanyl hcl and mixed with 10ml vinegar then mixed with 1000ml pedialyte ( I used the pedialyte because I had it left over from when my dog had been dehydrated). Anyways, I knew that this stuff was strong when 50mcg was too much for me! Anyways, I began adding 9ml of water to only 1ml of the Fentanyl. Well, I was only dosing myself 1ml of this formulation which was a mere 10mcg of fentanyl and still way too strong. So, I finally just stopped it altogether and I dumped it into the comode and flushed it. Now what I am going through is really causing me to wonder if I am going to die...FOR REAL!! I must add that when I dosed myself, my ROA was plugging it. And since I have stopped it altogether, right before I get the feeling that I need to have a bowel movement, I get a head rush, my teeth get numb, etc. And that doesn't fully wear off until about an hour of having my bowel movement. Well, not to be too thorough about this, but after "going", I looked into the commode and it looked like a "gel" of clear medicine. So, I am beginning to wonder if the fentanyl did not fully dissolve into my rectum and some residual fentanyl actually moved up further when I had done clear water enemas, to flush it back out of me a half hour after I had administered the fentanyl rectally. I would do this everytime after about a half hour of administering it. The only thing that I can figure out is that it did not fully dissolve and went further up into my intestines and is now coming back out when I have a bowel movement..a little at a time and when it does, some is absorbing into my colon and this is why this is happening. Now my question is this...has anyone else at all had this type of experience. I can not figure out what is going on, other than what I have written. But, if I'm wrong, then someone please clarify this for me.  And please let me know what is going on. Mind you, this was pure fentanyl hcl powder what was without a doubt the DUMBEST THING I HAVE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE!!! It will never, ever happen again! Any thoughts? Anyone else been through this? I only used this for a total of 6 days and only dosed myself no more than 4 times a day with no more than 10mcg at a time, other than the very first time which was 50mcg and way too strong for me. Can anyone at all tell me how long it will take to get out of my body? I am so scared that maybe too much will get obtained in my colon at a time and I am afraid to try and push it out of my body by means of enemas and then possibly getting too much medicine at one time. I am convinced that this stuff wasn't pure....something wasn't right about it at all...way too strong! Please help me out if you can. Thanks!!!

Rules or no rules, giving specific instructions for illegally using some drug probably violates a zillion laws, and I doubt anyone will be silly enough to stick their neck out like that.  Also, that kind of thing could easily cause tons of trouble for the site itself.

They recently had a huge operation in my state. 50 warrants were placed and almost 40 were apprehended by sunset that day. They were investigating the circulation of a specific stamp known to have fentantyl mixed in. Not a single one of our 'people' answered that day, only one connect was taken down and the rest who weren't on the warrant list simply went into hiding for the day. Ironically I recognized the name of the stamp they were seeking as I sort of have an odd habit of collecting stamps. I don't know it's just a fascination I have, they're just as interesting to me as cards to a card collector, or hey stamps to a stamp collector! Fentanyl has definitely found its way into my town on a massive level, people overdosing left and right, it's scary. I'm a rather light user at snorting no more than 4 bags a day, some days only 2 and some days I take a small piece of sub. Anyway to stick with the subject, I don't purposely buy fentanyl but I have definitely had product with it in it unbeknownst to me until after the fact, as I'm sure is usually the case. Also in the ironical fashion that is my life, my father died of a fentanyl laced heroin overdose more than 15 years ago before it was anything like it was now. They certainly didn't have the shit they do now to 'bring you back to life' after od'ing. He was a chronic shooter until the day he died and he always said he'd rather die than quit and well he got his wish. Looks like I learned well. I guess I try to justify that I don't shoot it or do it that often so it's not that bad but let's face it the rotten apple doesn't fall far from the tree, I'm daddy's little girl over here.

**Can a used modern fentanyl patch be rejuvinated through scraping it?**


Sitting here with a bunch of used patches (modern non-gel) and wondering about ways to see if I sucked all there is to suck; absorbed all there is to absorb.

So I took an envelope opener and started to scrape the back of one and now sucking on it.  Not sure if I got a result yet but Im wondering if anyone else tried doing this?


Thank you kindly.

How long were the patches used for? If they were taken off after 72 hours there should still be a decent amount of fentanyl left in them.

**Fentanyl Patch question**


Hi All,

I just received a 50mcg/hr Duragesic Fentanyl patch. Although I usually uses opiates about one week a month I am not confident my tolerance is high enough to take the patch. I usually take about 30-60mg Oxycodone a day or around 90mg Morphine SA a day.


Does anyone have any advice, experiences or suggestions?


Thanks!

50mcg is a typical dose and the starting dose when it was prescribed to me but if you are concerned or feel it is unnecessarily high bring it to your doctors attention. Also if it is the matrix type it can be cut into smaller doses.

The recommended starting dose of someone with tolerance to 90mg morphine or 60mg oxy is 25mcg.

No. Once you remove it you mess up the membrane that allows it to transfer 


25 mcg is the equivalent starting dose, 50 mcg if worn (and not tampered with) you should be fine with. If you start getting dizzy, have to vomit, difficulty keeping eyes open --then I would remove it. The first time I wore one it was too high of a dose and I knew cause after 4 or so hours I just got very nauseous and threw up 


But if you take it off don't bother trying to restick it.

So if I take the patch off it will start to wear off? How soon should I start to feel it? Basically I'm asking if it's possible to back out if I feel it is too strong. From your comment above it seems like that is possible?

Would cutting the patch and just applying the gel directly to the skin have any stronger effect? I've only read about smoking/eating/injecting it.

I'm prescribed fentanyl patches for chronic pain and if you read up on how the patch actually works you need to have it on for approximately 17-24 hours before it starts working properly. The fentanyl from the patch diffuses nto the subcutaneous tissue and builds up a depot which then leaches into the bloodstream. Leaving it on for a couple of hours then taking it off won't work...also once you take it off it won't re-stick.


The reason the patch contains so much more fentanyl than it actually delivers (16.8mg total fentanyl content in a 100mcg/hour patch as oppose to delivering  only 7.2mg total over 72 hours) is that there has to be a much higher fentanyl content in the patch in order to maintain the necessary diffusion gradient.


There are many ways people abuse the patches which I won't go into but I suggest reading as much as possible about how they actually work before doing something with them that you may later regret.....


Stay safe...

I got the fent dope, scary shit!


My guy was out of town, usually IV 6-10 bags a day of this nice brown powder, were a 6 bag shot has me nodding.


Went to a fellow junkies boy in the city over,picked up some stamps of some white as Coke dope and knew from there i had some fentanyl.


2 bags I did, just to test it, thinking I'd be ok with my tolerance being nice - nope - BOOM, intense rush, nodded out within 5 minutes, woke up next to my needle wondering what the fuck hit me.


Now what confuses me is I was very itchy from these bags, like I haven't scratched so hard since I started using. Could this be a cut, or did I just get some fire white smack.


Anyway, stay safe out there guys, I'm not shooting anything white anytime soon

I would say the same thing because I'm up to six bags a day and this much I can tell you it's going to kill me in the next couple months. Listen people, you might get curious and say well I want to try that don't I promise you you will end up dead. Self   experience. The only thing you gain by doing fentanyl is you will never be able to do heroin again will never be able to do Dilaudid again will never be able to do anything again because your tolerance is way way too high. I'm  come on quit cold turkey a player but if it's next to death as I'm laying in this bed. Just be careful out there guys.

Hello all. I am new to the forum, and new to Fentanyl. I have a few questions, if it's OK, and I figured here was the best place. I'll try to make this short, so please bear with me. 

  To get started, I had an accident at work in 2009. I tore my rotator cuff, ruptured my c5 disk, and had a compression fracture of my t5 vertabra. They replaced my c5 disk with a Synthesis ProDisc artificial disk. 

  The nerves were pinched for a long time due to fighting with workers comp. I didn't get the surgery until almost a year after the accident. The surgery didn't help, and I have cervical spondylosis, radiculapathy, and nerve degeneration. That, my shoulder, and the compression fracture hurt all the time. 

  I have been taking Percocet 10/325 & Morphine Sulfate 15 mg ER for now going on 6 years. They have lost their effectiveness over time, as expected, and I am miserable most days.

  Recently I went back to work. About 3 months after starting work, I was moving some boards, and I ruptured my l5 disk. I have pain running down my left leg, and toes get numb & tingle, & I can hardly walk, let alone the added pain. I am now seeing a pain management specialist. He has switched me to Mylan Fentanyl patches 12.5 Mcg/hr. 

  I have heard so many stories about them, specifically OD's, & honestly I am concerned about using them. I have been using them for a week now, but they don't help. I'm not sure if I'm not applying them correctly, or have them in the wrong place or what. 

  The reason I am asking this here is because through the history of taking the Percocet & MS, as well as societies change towards chronic pain & opioids, I don't want him to look at me like I'm an addict, you know? 

  I take the patch out of it's pouch, & without touching it using one side of the plastic it's adhered to, I place it on my clean and dry shoulder right above my collarbone. Am I placing it in the right spot. If not, where is the best place? Also, considering my tolerance to the Percocet (I know fentanyl is a different drug) is the dosage too low? 

  Another point of note. From my understanding, correct me if I'm wrong Fentanyl is a fully synthetic opiod. I tried Nucynta a few years back, and it didn't work, that's why my Dr. switched me back to Morphine ER. Nucynta is a fully synthetic opioid. Could it be that fully synthetic opioids don't work for me? Have you heard of people that way? 

  Thanks for your help. Sorry about the novel, I just wanted to describe everything so maybe someone can help me figure this out.

  Thanks again for any help you might be able to give

^ sounds like you are putting it on correctly, I think it is usually recommended to be put on chest or back...but shoulder ought to be ok 


You're on a very low dose (12.5 mcg/hr)...with your built up tolerance that may not be enough. Also, some people feel much better effects from one brand over another. 


There is a Pain Management mega-thread that may be of more help to you and your situation. A lot of people in this thread tend to be recreational users  I would link it, but I suck at that on my phone. Mod help?

What exactly do you mean? 

A "solution" as in a liquid? Or just a formulation that delivers the fentanyl transdermally?

It's liquid. Wasn't sure how much to do or even how to do it. I figured it out though. Definitely don't need more than a couple drops. Works great.

Yes Johnny Trusnt, you will have withdrawal symptoms. I'm on 100 mcg/72 hrs and always change my patch before I go to bed. If I forget to change it, by morning I'm in withdrawal and SICK AF! Quitting Fentanyl cold turkey is dangerous. You could have a stroke, seizures and many other dangerous things. I don't know what your situation is, but I would try to dose down slowly.  Whatever you choose, be careful

Really?


I had no idea that quitting Fentanyl cold turkey was known to cause strokes, seizures, and "many other dangerous things". Can you explain to me HOW this happens? I mean, I already understand how quitting alcohol, benzo's, or barbs for example could cause similar symptoms....but not Fentanyl. 


And since I am currently prescribed Fentanyl, it concerns me that I have not yet heard about these problems arising from going CT.

^As is the case with any cold turkey, even off a relatively small habit like 60 mg of oxycodone a day, your body is taking a beating. This can precipitate many medical conditions to which your body may be prone to suffering. Now a large fentanyl dose is a harsh withdrawal, so it's no doubt it will tax your body even more.


It's pretty simple concept, all opiate withdrawal increases blood pressure and pulse rate. Both of which will put you at greater risk for strokes, heart attacks, internal hemorrhages, etc. I'm not too sure about seizures, but if someone does have a history of them, then going through opioid w/d surely could be a cause for one to occur. 


All this is hence why things like benzos and alpha-2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine almost must have for a really harsh kick like coming off a large fentanyl habit.

This can precipitate many medical conditions to which your body may be prone to suffering. Now a large fentanyl dose is a harsh withdrawal, so it's no doubt it will tax your body even more.

Ah, so you simply mean that withdrawal can exacerbate or trigger any preexisting conditions someone may have(such as high BP or seizures). THAT, I did know. I guess I just misunderstood the original post on this subject. It sounded to me like FallenAngel72 was saying that WD could DIRECTLY cause these problems. My mistake.....I agree that WD(or ANY extremely stressful situation) has the potential to make any preexisting condition worse.

If I've just opened it can I still wear the he'll patch? It has a home in it but am I still able to just seal the hole and use it? Or is orally the only way?

     Can you retype your post please? It's impossible to know exactly what you are talking about, what your problem is, or what question(s) you're asking since your grammar is not very good(no offense). I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you are saying and asking so I can give you the correct/relevant advice. You can use the "edit" function to fix your post without having to write a whole new one.


     If I had to guess I would assume you meant to say that you have a Fentanyl patch(probably Duragesic w/ gel reservoir instead of Matrix patch)...of an unknown dosage since you didn't mention the dose level(or your tolerance for that matter)....and you have poked a hole in the patch so you can squeeze the gel out to use in some way other than transdermally....You mentioned "orally" as being a possible only available ROA, but PLEASE don't do that. Taking fentanyl orally is literally one of the worst ways you can take it since it has a HORRIBLE oral BA(this is why it is made into patches to be taken transdermally where it has a 96% BA) and it can also upset your stomach since that gel is not meant to be consumed.

If you must use the gel squeezed thru the hole and cannot wear the patch as prescribed, I would recommend using it buccally. This ROA is around 50% BA if I'm not mistaken, and can cause plenty of euphoria. Just be careful how much gel you apply to your gums/cheek at once, given how potent Fentanyl is.

     But if you only have a small hole poked in the gel reservoir, I know from experience that you can probably still wear it transdermally as long as you cover the hole with something that will stay in place and completely block the opening(duct tape maybe). This method is the one I would advise the most because you get a ~96% BA PLUS the patch will last MUCH longer. And if you want to feel more of a "rush" or more euphoria you can simply apply heat(I use a heating pad) to help release more Fentanyl at once....but you gotta be careful and know your tolerance(which as I said you never mentioned anything about your tolerance...so it's impossible to give you advice on how much to take).


Anyway, I'm just guessing at what you said....please clarify your post so I can clarify my answer.

Be careful and have fun!

I have been surfing this website forever to try and find the right thread.   Please, I need advice.  I had the dope boy (H) come to my spot last night and 3 cops raided him before he pulled into my house approx 20 yards from my driveway and it wasn't obvious where he was going...So, after 2 hours of them playing cat and mouse (I am seeing this go down through my window), they decide to take him in one squad car and the others stay....I figure great, they will tow his car and no backlash on me, right? (Not that I don't care for my man, but nothing I could do for him, he had an outstanding warrant and i'm on probation).  Well about 30 minutes goes by and i'm assuming their waiting around for the tow truck but then a detective arrives in his personal vehicle and the first thing he shouts when he gets out of the car is where is the phone!! (I had a window cracked so that's really the only thing I could hear clearly the whole time).   About another 10 minutes goes by and all at once, 3 of the cops flash their lights on my house and proceed to walk up to the door...naturally, I wasn't home.  They never asked to come in, as a matter of fact, they didn't even knock.  From previous experiences and just some personal accounts on related situations, do you think I need to look for a lawyer and prepare for this?  He's already booked in county and i don't think he would roll, however i'm sure he always could, I mean everyone has a price, right? But they would go for the big fish right over some junkie on a small sale.  BTW the reason why i'm nervous guys is because like a fool, this is all documented through my phone service via phone calls and text messages.  Will they come back?

I understand why you're nervous...but I'm pretty damn sure you got nothing to worry about. They are not going to arrest a dealer so they can "break him" until he gives up his customers name. The cops are trying to move UP the food chain. Not down. 

Plus they have no evidence/proof of a deal going down....bc there was no deal...they busted him before he got to you....which to me shows that they REALLY don't give a shit about his junky customers cuz they could easily have let him serve you first before busting him....but they didn't....cuz you won't benefit them and will only cost the taxpayers money and take up space in jail, plus arresting you would mean a TON of paperwork on top of the paperwork for your dealer(My sis dated a cop for a long time...apparently the paperwork they have to fill out whenever they make an arrest is even more ridiculous than they say in the movies/TV shows). 

And also...they probably already arrested one of his customers. That's probably how they got the evidence that got them a warrant to arrest him in the first place. 

Trust me...their busy interrogating him right now trying to get him to roll on his suppliers....not his customers.


*Shit...I just found out that this type of discussion is not allowed. My bad.*

So trying to smoke a new Duragesic (non-reservoir) patch on a spoon with heat from a gas oven burner, about a 10th or a bit more of a 50mcg/hr patch. All that was gained was a headache akin to when you get an IV in the hospital, and a bit of a rush. My question is, is fentanyl not for nodding? Should one who's experiencing this increase the amount smoked? Tolerance is ~26mg of dilaudid, snorted, for a 6-7/10 high.


UPDATE : Boy sure do feel like an idiot, tried it on tinfoil and with a larger straw, much better effects. Still not quite the "take one hit and OD" ballpark though.

So what exactly is the solubility for HCl in water,? Is 50mg/250 mk or 1mg/5 ml a good minimal ratio based on the supposed 100 mg of the HCl to 2 liter of water? I might be wrong so don't take my words as guidance.


Also what else could be used in once if benzyl alcohol to preserve a solution?

Man I hope that's effective.   Fentanyl's been killing people at a far greater rate than heroin or pills ever did. If you're on a patch, fair go, but fuck the stuff that comes in baggies. Good riddance.

Hey all. Just had a discectomy. They gave me Demerol. Dilaudid and fentanyl. It was around 6 hrs ago. I was prescribed Percocet for breakthrough pain. I've been going to a methadone center for about ten years and I follow the methadone treatment like it's supposed to be. Never took any illicits since I've been there. So total tee totaler here. No alcohol. No pot. Nothing. I usually take my methadone now since I have a third shift schedule. It's around midnight now. Am I ok to take my dose six hours after having all that stuff? I am really hurting but I don't wanna take any percocets if I can keep from it. Please someone help me out. Thanks all

I would say yes. but you're best off asking the doctor at the clinic.

Really hope this isn't against the rules but I copied my first post from the new members section into what might be a more suitable thread. I am new so bear with me guys.


I want to talk about a topic I don't see anyone talking about. On a side  note I am a former dealer that has been out of the game for many years,  I was mid level, not the guy you call for your fix. So I have a open  mind on how the real world works.


So the topic I am bringing up deals with fentynol, a drug created in  1959 and also a drug that no one heard about until fairly recently. Sure  some people knew about it but not like it is known today with it being  front page news almost daily. I wonder if the weed legalization in  certain places in the west has made big corporations, pharmaceutical  companies and large retail chains looking to make more profit might be  the very reason for this whole epidemic.  


Why did I come to this conclusion? When it was first making the news I  thought back to the prohibition era in the 1920's and how that all  ended, one of the biggest reasons to end it was because drinkers were  dying from an unregulated product. The argument then was to legalize,  tax and regulate it to make it safer for the community. Fentynol is  having this very same effect. Do a quick google search and you now see  that mainstream news is posting articles about full legalization as a  measure of harm reduction. BC has a prescription heroin program that is  small of course but seems like a way to back up legalization talks in  the future with a proven case study.


Big pharma is big money with it's tentacles in every aspect of  government, I am talking real power to manipulate newspapers, law  enforcement, intelligence agency's the works. We know that over the past  decade the rise of oxy and the money it made them, but now good luck  getting prescribed for pain meds these days. Is it too far fetched to  think they might come up with a way to get drugs legalized? To  increase profits in a magnitude the likes they have never seen before? I  think oxy wet their beak so to speak, so they looked at the past and  devised a way to change public perception on the war on drugs. No other  way would have worked. It would have been another 50 years before you  read any article even remotely talking about legalization of hard drugs.


I have always been for legalization and I don't even use opiates, I just  use common sense. But whenever the media start beating their drums on a  subject you should always try to see the agenda being put forth.  Mainstream media is owned by large corporations, they don't need to lie  but they can focus on something that you talk about  and think on. You see it all the time and then you come to the  conclusion that something must be done now. I think within 2 years you  will see a radical change on drug policy in the west. It's just sad that  they went about it in this manner.                         


I would like to hear your thoughts on this, seems like a lot of talk about the dangers of this drug but not much talk about why in the past few years it has exploded on the scene.

I have a 60-120mg a day oxycodone habit and just came into a 50mcg per hour mallinckrodt non gel fent patch. I cut it into 1/32 pieces to place in my cheek. One i left for 10 minutes, the next i just chewed. I feel nothing tho, should I try another and am I dosing too low?

With an oxy habit like that you could do a quarter. Yea it's good to be safe but those non gel ones suck. At least the gel you can vape tiny dots. Plus the oral ba sucks and buccal isn't great either. Just stick it to your gums. I would prob eat the whole thing but that's me.. I once co sumed the gel from a 25mcg patch, spread on my gums, was going about the same AMT of oxy 100 to 160 and it didn't do a ton. Fent sucks unless you can get a safe amp to shoot

Hello.

(First, I'm very new to the site and so my posting etiquette may be less  than ideal. Constructive critiques are welcome. Moving on)


I used to get the [Mallinckrodt](https://www.google.com/search?q=Mallinckrodt&spell=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwitzu-N8MDVAhVJLmMKHTxHCpoQvwUIJSgA&biw=1366&bih=614) brand of patch. I preferred them to the gel-containing type, but that's just me. 

When I used to use those, my method was pretty simple- I would chew the  actual matrix (adhesive/drug containing part) of the patch *after removing it from the backing.*

 I would cut a piece (say, 1/8 of it, but dosage is your business- **Use caution!**).

I would remove the backing, then I'd *pinch and pull *from the edge of the piece, causing the stretchy glue side to pull apart from the not stretchy backing.

Once you get that started, one can easily peal the glue (drug  containing) side apart from the (essentially useless) backing sheet.

I would then simply shew the glue like a tiny piece of gum,trying not to  swallow, but really it wont hurt you to swallow and I don't think you  lose much of the drug itself if you do swallow, but try not to swallow  too often.


Now, due to insurance changes causing me to lose my pain management  doctor and the prescription I had been on I have had to switch to the  Mylan brand, which is also a FLAT non-gel format.

Unfortunately the adhesive (good) part doesn't pull apart like it did  with the Mallinckrodt- in fact, the whole thing just stretches, backing  and all.

This isn't really a major issue though.

With the Mylan I find that the stretching at least increases the overall  surface area of the patch portion so you gan get at the sweet nectar  withing more easily.

The first time I tried chewing the Mylan I was a bit concerned that it may not work like my old brand did. 

While it feels different to chew on (a bit less gummy) it works the same  way. It took about 30-40 minutes before I could fell the effect, and  once it kicked-in it was pretty much exactly the same as the old  Mallinckrodt. Just chew it for a good hour (or more even) to insure that  you're getting everything out of it.

**DO NOT GET IMPATIENT and take more before you've given it a good hour to kick in. If you take too much you cannot take it back! 


Note: Fentanyl is a very potent and clean medication, so you won't  necessarily feel the same effects as it comes on as you do with other  opioid medications! You may feel next to nothing until- WHAM! you're  quite suddenly itching and nearly nod out.

**By comparrison, drugs like heroin have a lot of "scenery"  between sober and wasted, meaning you really feel yourself getting  higher and higher.

Fentanyl is NOT that way due to it being a clean and potent drug. 

Because of this, it may not be as "fun" as other drugs in this class,  but it's still VERY effective for pain and relief of the WDs**.

I think this is part of why a lot of people say they don't feel anything  when taking fentanyl using any method, until they do. If you get  impatient and take too much, you can easily overdose. Don't do that,  okay?

Any way to verify that my "lofentanil" is actually that?

With the dosages required, idk, it seems like it'd be more potent.

I saw Benzyl-fentanyl popping up recently on Ecstacy Data, used in counterfeit pills. But why do you think the pill-pressers are using benzylfentanyl when it's allegedly inactive?

I can find a ton of information on fentanyl transdermal patch to other opiods conversions however nothing for nasal spray. i.e. how much a one time hit should be calculated at.


I have a Takeda pharma 5ml, 40 spray, 200microgram dose  fentanyl nose spray. 


What is the strength in oxycodon, of one dose of the above mentioned spray? My usual IR oral oxycodon dose is 120mg-140mg (3-4times a day) and I am trying to work out a safe starting dose, I obviously want to start slow before getting acquainted and finding my sweet spot.

It can vary quite a bit, but you can find a opioid equivalence table very easily online by googling it..


If trust than far more than asking the question on here..

unfortunately, as i mentioned, i can only find conversions for transdermal or IV/IM fent. I cannot find information regarding nasal use, neither is the nasal BA listed on the first page of the thread. Maybe I just dont know the correct terminology... could you kindly link me to a converter with nasal fent on there?

Intranasal bioavailability of fent is around 89% but can vary by as much as 30% of that figure 


So take IV or transdermal fent as having a BA of 100% and do the conversion to oxycodone and then multiply by 0.89.

thanks - this helped a lot with the nasal BA. Will start with one spray which is easily safe even accounting for 100% BA, will then judge from that whether the next time I dose I will start with two sprays. Would the half-life of nasal fent be similar to IV/IM?

Good..I'm glad it helped.


As for the half life, once the drug is in your system, the half life is the same for all ROAs. Obviously intranasal will take a bit longer to get into your bloodstream than IV but only a few minutes. Once it's there it will decay in the same way.


Its good practice to assume 100% BA then you're always erring on the side of caution.

Can the fake blue roxy pressed fent pills be vaporized off foil like the real roxys can? A friend of mine recently got sold some fakes that match the description the the fake pressed fents that have been going around. He has experience with fent but doesn't wanna o.d. so he wants to guage the potency if its possible for them to be smoked off foil? Any thoughts? Thanks. I want to make sure he is as safe as possible.

We can't speculate as to the contents of the pills if they are indeed fakes, but if they are fent, or even a small portion of them are, this would be a very, very bad idea. I'd dispose of them immediately, myself.

Jesus, lucky is an understatement, and a harsh lesson in why fentanyl and it's analogues aren't to be trifled with, along with fake pills containing who knows what, from benign powder to carfent that might take out the household.

Sorry Mr. Nightraver.  I would've gotten back sooner, but it's not clear what you were up to.  Are you saying you're actually prescribed 240mg of oxycodone per day?  And yet you have a fentanyl patch containing a mere 12ug.  I don't think they even go as low as 12ug/hr.


Normally you should absolutely avoid all other downers and opioids while using a fentantyl patch, that is absolutely true.

Hi guys, checking in....


long time lurker here, used bluelight.org/ru for close to 20 years when googling drug resources.


I have a genetic joint disease that causes me a lot of pain. I'm no stranger to opiates and have been on them since I was a teenager. However, I never ever got dependant in that time. I was using codeine/dhc/tramadol and occasionally morphine but I could always stop and didn't care if I ran out.


Then I had a big flair up and I got put on low level fentanyl patches temporarily. That was the start of my incredibly fucked descent into full blown opiate addiction. For the next few months it slowly built up into caining my prescription within a few days then doing whatever I could to illegally obtain fentanyl/fentalogues and if I couldn't get those then heroin, oxy etc but my tolerance has just gone through the roof I need a shed load of even that! I can get Zomorph morphine tablets but I find now I need 400mg orally just to get a buzz which, although I can't discuss pricing isn't financially viable at all.


I have my best friends stag do and wedding which I am best man for coming up in June and July. I really, really want to be clean for then.... 


argh 8(


It's not even the physical aspect. It's the insidious mental draw, the intense drug searching dreams etc. I was so unprepared for this.

Hey guys I have alot of experience with fent patches unfortunately and can answer any questions.


First of all FUCK apotex brand. I had one yesterday and had to do the WHOLE THING buccally to get buzzed. Waste of fucking money. Have alvogen right now, can safely use 1/3 of a patch at first and then up to 1/2 of the same patch total an hour later. MUCH BETTER USE OF MONEY! No rush, but the buzz is fucking worth it. This is buccal use.

Hi all,

 I have come across 2 mylan 50mcg patches that i have been cutting and using buccally to combat any withdrawals from a 100mg a day norco habit for about a month.

Can anyone tell me after placing in my mouth about how long it takes for all the fentanyl to be gone? Can i take it out and put back in later to redose?

Also i plan to taper this way and cut the strips smaller and smaller, doing this will it help alleviate any major shitty withdrawal? Or would it be best to just place a portion of the patch on my skin after reducing down to a certain point?

Any prompt responses would be appreciated.

Thanks

I hate to tell you this but you are using something WAY stronger than 100 mg of Norco a day. 

This is not "tapering you down" it is getting you strung out! 

If you think the withdrawal from Norco is bad, wait until you get the withdrawal from that fentanyl stuff! 


Please stop using that immediately and you will see what I am saying to you!

You are getting yourself into a major problem! 


Go back to the norco and taper down with that.

I am not using the full 50mcg a day. i am using a strip cut from it that would total around 6mcg/hr pieces. i am using about 1 of those 6mcg strips a day by placing in mouth around 3 times a day for about an hour.

The equal analgesic for 6mcg patch assuming that I'm getting every bit of it buccaly and all 72hrs worth at one time is equal to 30mg morphine total give or take. and that is if the buccal biovalibility is 100%, and from what I've read it is only around 50-60%.

I can't imagine this is worse than 100mg norco a day. but if i am wrong, please correct me and show me how i calculated this wrong.

I am not very savvy with fentanyl, but have dabbled in the past, so if my thinking/calculation is wrong, someone please put me on the right track.

Also i don't have access to any more norco, I've got one more 50mcg patch, i am really just wanting to know what the best way is to slowly reduce the amount of opiates hitting the receptors so that in a few days it will be easier to cold turkey.

Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid drug which is approximately 100 times more powerful than morphine (source: Janssen Pharmaceuticals Canada).


I'm not lying to you my friend. I don't know where you got the information that fentanyl was anywhere near equal to 30 mg morphine.

You could now take 100 mg Norco and it would not have any effect. 


You are lucky you are not dead but I am worried about you. If I was you, I would cut those last strips into tiny pieces and wean yourself down very carefully. Please check in and let me know how it is going.

The transdermal bioavailability is 92% if wikipedia is to be trusted. The buccal only 50%. From what I understand in a 50mcg/hour patch there is 5.1 mg of fent. So a 6mcg/hour piece has 5100mcg/50mcg x 6mcg = 612mcg. Bioavailibility cuts that number in half if everything is absorbed so 306mcg that are actually available. Fentanyl is 50 to 100 times stronger than Morphine so the equianalgesic dose would be a minimum of 306 x 50 = 15300mcg = 15.3mg Morphine if everything was absorbed (not sure if 3 hours buccally are enough for that) or a maximum of 306 x 100 = 30600 = 3,6mg Morphine. 


So I think your math was correct.


Hydrocodone and Morphine are equianalgesic so you lowered your habit to a third of what it was and got rid of the Acetaminophen which is hella bad for you at that habit over time.

Does anybody know about Abstral sublingual fentanyl tablets - is the fentanyl evenly distributed to the pill so that cutting it to pieces would be a possible way of dosing it?

I'm also wondering how would I compare 400mcgs of sublingual fentanyl to oral morphine or oxycodone. The web conversion calculators do not seem to offer the possibility to measure fentanyl for sublingual dosing.

It may vary from brand to brand but both Janson Ciag Durogesic and Sandoz Mezolar matrix brand both contain 8.6mg fent per patch not 5.1 (but as i say this may vary, I dont know what brands you have in the States


While the conversion to morphine has generally been taken as 100/1 there are many sources that now put this at 150/1 and in fact this is the number that the doctors in my area have been told to use (that is 1mg fent = 150mg oral morphine).


Ive found using the patches buccaly, most of the glue (which contains the drug) is absorbed bucally in a couple of hours or less (some will obviously be swallowed inadvertantly) and your figure of 50% bioavailability is also the figure ive read too).


It creaps up on you very fast by this method though and ramps tollerance up fast.. anyone doing this should be very careful obviously.

**fentanyl is a horrible deadly drug**


I been on a ride.

prescribed fentanyl for 3weeks had to come off, made me feel homicidal/suciidal at times, I would get a bad rattle after 50hours and my ibs kick in bad.

I'd feel smashed off it the first day, did get good euphoria at times for like a hour then feel dysphoric.

I did try a spare patch out tiny bits in boiling hot water then snort the water and put it under my tongue.

felt amazing for a bit then I took more and felt like a car was driving on my chest.

The switch to oxycodone 80mg isnt nice, I havnt took them since saturday and still feel restless.


It killing people everywhere, it really is for dieing people or really old people in pain not a 25 year old male with fibromyalgia.

but hes going to want to take my instants off me I might just say change them to extended 10mg twice a day onto my others and just crush the fuckers.


but yeah fuck fentanyl ive got 3 25micrograms/hr patches and not even been tempted, might return them dont want to sell them anybody even tho am skint.

keeping them for if my life still a bag of shit in 5 years or when all my family is gone.

How is the intensity of pain experienced proportional to age? You say fentanyl is not for a 25 year old with fibro, but I dont understand what you base that on? The fact you had a bad withdrawal?


I was prescribed fent patches after a back surgery at age 32.  I was on oxy and the pain was so bad that fent kept me from killing myself.  I tapered off of the patch by cutting it smaller and smaller (matrix patches only!) And had the easiest withdrawal I have ever had in my life from any opioid.


When people decide to IV illicit fent from China and then die, they made thier own bed and that happening should have ZERO bearing on the availability of perfectly safe pharmaceutical fent for those in pain that dont plan to IV it.


I did overdose on abused fent. It was solely my fault and I  take ownership  and do not blame the medical establishment  like you and everyone else wants to scape  goat.

Agreed, fentanyl is only useful in extreme cases where someone has a ridiculous tolerance and can't manage their pain in any other way.

Alrighty then...I was a long term user of Fentanyl patches...100mcgrms each....

Take the patch , get a iron , turn on the steam , turn the patch unside down on the face of the iron...hit the steam button and hold for 30 seconds....the gel will peel off with a razor blade...lay it on your tounge and hang on to something....you will get so fucking high...it's 100 times stronger than Morphine...be careful if you don't have a high tolerance...!!!!! It really works great...I'm currently taking methadone....just be careful using this method of ingestion as it can overdose you very easily....

Does anyone have experiences with Fentanyl patches?

I have used percocet 10-15mg a day and my friend gave me 12.5mcg of fent transdermal. My question is, does it make u feel euphoric as the oxy? What can i expect ? Is the pain relief decent? Im hesitant to use it however I am not ?opioid naive? as the precautions indicate. Thoughts? Experiences?

No, I didn't. BUT I still need to know for future incidents..running out of subtext early..ect..

Im sure my tolerance is through the roof.. I been on subs for years and been snorting 3 mgs for the last 2 years.

I just want to be safe with this stuff, cause when I run out of meds, it's what's around and I can't remember how I done it back in the day. Seem like I chewed on a 25mcg part of the patch.

I just want to kill the withdrawal.. that's it and do it safely.

Fentanyl has been in heroin stamp bags for years now! The first time I was caught with stamps was in 99. They tested it : 1/4 heroin #4 1/4 I phenobarbital b1/4 fentanyl 1/4 r stamp was orange crush


Next time caught :

1/2 heroin

1/2 fentanyl 

My dealer would only sell me two and he earned me hardly not to take both. So of course I did and if my aunt didn't  come through the front door I would have laid dead on the steps where she found me

Stamp of "Energy" 

Last time caught in 2006


1/2 heroin

1/4 fentanyl

1/4 unknown cut

Stamps: mix of : Now and Layers, Gatorade, Kit Kat, m&ms, jaguar 


So as far as I know the bags on the east coast that are in wax stamp bags sometimes double sealed in plastic always have fentanyl and always did. The withdrawal is so much worse.

> Is commonly used to treat Cancer patients and chronic breakthrough pain as well as pre-procedure in a hospital setting, Fentanyl is a synthetic primary μ-opioid.  It’s approximately 100 times more potent than morphine; 100 micrograms of fentanyl is approx. equivalent to 10mg of morphine in analgesic activity.

> 
> 
> 
> Fentanyl was first synthesized by Dr. Paul Janssen in 1960 following the medical inception of meperidine several years earlier. Janssen developed fentanyl by assaying analogues of the structurally-related drug meperidine for its opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate (fentanyl combined with citrate at a 1:1 ratio), which entered the clinical practice as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. Following this, many other fentanyl analogs were developed and introduced into the medical practice, including Sufentanil, Alfentanil, Remifentanil, and Lofentanil.

> 
> In the mid 1990s, fentanyl saw its first widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch, followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal tablets. Through the delivery method of transdermal patches, fentanyl is currently the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice, with several new delivery methods currently in development.  Fentanyl is classified as a Schedule II drug in the United States due to its potential for abuse.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fentanyl)

> 
> In regards to Pain Management and Polymer Matrix Transdermal Patches, Fentanyl should not be applied to a patient unless having been on an opiate schedule that is equivalent to 14 days use at 60mg of oral morphine per day, which is equivalent to 40mg of oxy - [check this converter](http://www.globalrph.com/fent.cgi).  The patient is started out on the lowest dose patch, 12mcg/hr, titrating up every 24 hours until stable.  Long term patients are generally safe to begin on 25mcg patches. 
> 
> 
> 
> For “fun” Fentanyl should be approached with great caution, especially to the opiate naïve who wish to indulge – this applies to all methods of administration; transdermal, smoking, IVing, bucally.  I will spare the whole “you shouldn’t be fucking with fentanyl” because in the end it is up to the user in the end.  The warnings are out there.  But I’m just going to declare I wouldn’t advise anyone with a tolerance that is less than, say around, 120mg oral oxy, single dose, to be using this drug any other way than it is intended.
> 
> 
> 
> Using the 120mg oral oxy tolerance as a guide, here are my recommendations for dosing for transdermal and buccal Fentanyl.  Remember I’m talking the Polymer Matrix ones here, not the Gels or lollypops as I have no experience with them.  If someone can give me some reliable information for an IV and smoking dose I’ll add them in as well.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> - **Buccal** – Start off with cutting the equivalent to 6mcg/hr, so ½ of a 12mcg patch. Place it up against your cheek, avoiding swallowing your saliva, lightly sucking in your cheeks in to apply pressure to it. Make sure it’s the actual sticky adhesive part against your cheek, that’s where the drug is stored after all. 
> 
> 
> 
> The buccal route has a much faster absorption rate than transdermal, so expect the initial effects to be present around the 15-20min mark, peaking around 60-90mins.  If you start to feel uneasy or overwhelmed at any point in time, take the patch out immediately.
> - **Transdermal** – Before you go applying anything make sure you have a good 24 hours set aside for when you do this because the patch takes around 12 hours to reach peak levels. Apply 12mcg/hr to your upper body, preferably on the upper bicep, chest area or on your shoulders. The closer to your heart the better as there’s less blood flow on your extremities. Increase your dose up according to how you feel, adding no more than 12mcg/hr at a time.
> 
> 
> 
> It’s difficult to gauge a good transdermal dose to begin with because of the time it takes for the Fentanyl to reach its full effects, but this doesn’t mean go crazy and think you can handle 50mcg/hr straight up.  Be patient and titrate up accordingly.  You may “waste” a few patches initially but your life is priceless.

I need some advice about how to IV fentanyl. Do you cook it? Please don’t give me the don’t do it stuff. I’m using a very small amount and have been smoking/ingesting for quite a awhile already. I have been injecting things for over 20 years. I just don’t know how to prepare a pill for IV use.

I just wanted to put out there that I live in Arizona and due to heroin becoming almost non-existent in my town due to the huge influx of blues or basically fentanyl pills that look like to an old oxy 30s, I got to admit that the withdrawals from these fentanyl pills compared to when I was shooting heroin everyday it's definitely worse

I don't know if this is still being managed by the OP [@Jabberwocky](https://www.bluelight.org/community/members/520884/) , but it might be worth including bioavailability being ~89% for **intranasal/snorting ROA**. Just something worth adding if you can.

Hi everybody, I got a couple of questions about this substance. For the last four months I been using approximately 20 to 40 mg of morphine IV. My habit is get the dope once every two weeks and stay the first week high as fuck and the upcoming week I go easy. So I have built some tolerance. Today my dealer move to another town and he left me 2 vials of Fentanyl as a present. I tried 150mcg and it's work perfectly fine. My doubt is how much can I shoot in 24hs? Can I get an overdose if I shoot 100mcg with 3 hours of separation between doses?
